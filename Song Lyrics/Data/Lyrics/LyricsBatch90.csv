Elton John,"Oh little Jeannie, you got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes and give it to the likes of me
Oh little Jeannie, she got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can, you make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh little Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years, you still retain the fears of youth
Oh little Jeannie, you got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burning it up so fast, searching for some lasting truth

And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh Jeannie, I will always be your fool

And I want you to be my acrobat, I want you to be my lover
Oh there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh oh Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

Stepped into my life from a bad dream
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh Jeannie I'm so in love with you
Stepped into my life from a bad dream",Little Jeannie [DVD]
Elton John,"I used to be a rolling stone
You know if the cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road

I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia Freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia Freedom, took me knee-high to a man
Yeah, gave me peace of mind, my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia Freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia Freedom, I love you, yes I do

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
Some others choose the good old family home

I like living easy without family ties
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia Freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia Freedom, took me knee-high to a man
Yeah, gave me peace of mind, my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia Freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia Freedom, I love you, yes I do

Philadelphia Freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia Freedom, I love you, yes I do

My Philadelphia Freedom shine on me, I love you
Shine a light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light, shine a light
Shine a light, won't you shine a light?
Philadelphia Freedom, I love
You know I love, you know I love you, yes I do

Philadelphia Freedom, I love you, yes I do
Philadelphia Freedom, don't you know that I love you? Yes I do
Philadelphia Freedom, don't you know that I love you? Yes I do
Philadelphia Freedom, don't you know that I love you? Yes I do",Philadelphia Freedom [DVD]
Elton John,"It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy hurts

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate world
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

Cold, cold heart

No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all

No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all
No sacrifice, at all",Sacrifice [DVD]
Elton John,"Tonight
Do we have to fight again
Tonight
I just want to go to sleep
Turn out the light
But you want to carry grudges
Nine times out of ten
I see the storm approaching
 Long before the rain starts falling

Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing
Tonight
It's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
And place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
And I cannot find the time

Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile
Tonight",Tonight [DVD]
Elton John,"Breaking down
Never seems to be that hard
Falling short
Is always in the cards
I'm on the road
Sun rising at my back
Lost it all
Somewhere between the cracks

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town
Gets to feel just like a job
My desire
Never winds up on top
I can't say now
I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach
Somewhere beyond this room

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

I've always tried to make things clear
Then I watched as progress stalled
I only hope I'm standing here
When Heaven finally comes to call

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Thankful; I'm thankful;
So thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

I'm thankful

So thankful

Elton John,"Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope in sight
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold onto something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky",Answer in the Sky
Elton John,"Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift

Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind

Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love",Freaks in Love
Elton John,"I can't keep this from you
I've held it in so long
It's time to tell the truth
Keeping it from you is wrong

I can't keep this from you
It's so simple I'm afraid
When I tell you how I feel
You'll just laugh and call me crazy

And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

I can't keep this from you
It's hard to breathe in here
I just seem to act the fool
Every time I feel you near

I can't keep this from you
No matter what you say
Anything is better now
Than going through my life this way

And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

And I love every move you make
Can't you hear every heart you break?
And don't you know when I hear your name?
Just the sound of it shoots me down in flames

And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you

I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you
Oh no
I just can't keep this from you",I Can't Keep This from You
Elton John,"We are still all right
We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour
No one ever wins

But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz

And I stop and I breathe
Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have

Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around

And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed

And I stop and I breathe
Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have

And I stop and I breathe
Cause you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Cause I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have",I Stop and I Breathe
Elton John,"It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here

I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moons so spooky 
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here

And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

Don't talk about angels
Or how I'll be saved
I'm no coward 
But I'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here

And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
And the wait isn't worth what I'm getting
Sometimes I feel I'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And I'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here

Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here",It's Getting Dark in Here
Elton John,"I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad

Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck

But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug

I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and I might grow a beard
There were times I was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price

But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug

And I've taken the pills
I got burnt out and chilled by the cold
But I've no regrets and that being said
You know cheap thrills can get pretty old

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah

But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction

Elton John,"There's a porch swing in Tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips offa that old hush yo mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old Natchez Trace 
Through Alabama cotton fields to a state of Grace

It's a crisp golden Autumn
On the Tennessee line
Rolling down to Mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth

And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in Tupelo

His mama must have loved him
That truck drivin' boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock 'n roll voice
Well I was just thinkin' 'bout him
Cause I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to God through poverty's tears

And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in Tupelo
I got nothing to do 'cept hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me

Elton John,"She threw back that shiny hair
Like the mane on a Delta queen
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
Cos' she's the wildest thing I've ever seen

She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood

Now they call her the cat 
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now Billy got a kitty 
He got something to scratch
So they call herâ?¦
Yeah they call her the cat

She just does that double act
She got Babs and Joan down pat
She got hips like Mick, she's a Rolling Stone

Elton John,"Did you see the first man on the moon?
Have you seen the first light of day?
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way

Did you go to Dallas on that day?
Have you been to where they broke a dream?
Where there really isn't room for doubt
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in-between 

And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried

The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky

Would you wait to stand inside his shoes?
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Something's die so other things might live

So everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried

Oh come on everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Cause too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried.",Too Many Tears
Elton John,"Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're goin' to Jacksonville
Cause our love's all worn out

You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years

You might still look pretty
In that lacy little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

I ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave
I ain't gonna shake, I ain't gonna break
I ain't gonna fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darlin' turn the lights out when you leave

Elton John,"I'm weary and I'm staying up late
And the rain hits my roof so hard
You know I'm no longer thirty
These days I'm happy to play
One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

Humidity hangs like a curtain
Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight
These days I'm happy to see
A sunset instead of a line

And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

There's a long list of names
That I don't recall
Even though my memory's good
The rain washed away
The lemons and weeds
When the weight of the world weighed more than it should

I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back",Weight of the World

Elton John,"I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose its like forgetting,
Losing who you are,
And at the same time,
Something makes you whole,
Its like that there's a music,
Playing in your ear,
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry,
It's a bit like being scared,
Confused and all mixed up,
And mad as hell,
It's like when you've been crying,
And you're empty, and you're full,
I don't know what it is,
It's hard to tell,

Its like that there's some music,
Playing in your ear,
But the music,
Is impossible,
Impossible to hear,

But then I feel it move me,
Like a burning deep inside,
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

Then suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh oh whoa.
I'm free.",Electricity [*]

Elton John,"If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me
I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows

Well if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two wheel combination
And I swear it's going to be the death of me",Rock 'n' Roll Madonna [*]
Elton John,"Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart

What have I got to do to make you want me,
What have I got to do to be heard,
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word.

It's sad (so sad)
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd.
It's sad (so sad)
Why can't we talk it over?

Elton John,"The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus:]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down",And the House Fell Down
Elton John,"He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The how's and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives

She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl ain't that enough
To rage against the day

[Chorus:]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the Sun King that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons I never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away

[Chorus]

And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh

[Chorus]

And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?

Elton John,"I've seen the bridge, and the bridge is long
And they built it high, and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind

[Chorus]
And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away?
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away

Standing on the bridge, looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide

[Chorus]

And the bridge - it shines
Oh, cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying

[Chorus]",The Bridge
Elton John,"I've been out on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around
I've seen it growing from next to nothing
Into a giant eating up your town

Called up the tealeaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands
She saw a mountain and a wild deer running
A crazy kid becoming a better man

But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waiting to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasing the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine silk Suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

[Chorus:]
And you can't go back and if you try it fails
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail
A sign hanging from it saying ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all just one more tale
About the Captain and the Kid

We've been missing at times in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes

Oh we've conjured up what we created
Way back then when I was standing up in six-inch heels
Now you're riding off into the sunset
And I'm still spinning like a Catherine wheel

But we stuck around for the battle
Waiting for a plan
To turn you into the Brown Dirt Cowboy
And me into a Rocket Man
It pleases the people some of the time
Digging into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

[Chorus x2]",The Captain and the Kid
Elton John,"I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

[Chorus:]
From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind

Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst

[Chorus x2]

In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind",I Must Have Lost It on the Wind
Elton John,"It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and busing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yeah just like Noah's ark

Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yeah it's just like Noah's ark

[Chorus:]
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

These four walls have seen
The Cockettes and the Casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

[Chorus]

And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say

[Chorus]",Just Like Noah's Ark
Elton John,"Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights

Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on Oxford Street
Now we're sitting in the South of France

Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

[Chorus]
Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you

Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee Williams play

Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall

Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside

Elton John,"We heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We've fallen in and I can't pull back
And I guess we'll have to stay

In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We're finally on our way

[Chorus:]
And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas
He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two, pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say ""welcome to the USA""

Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were where it's at
Or so the papers say

And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson's promised land
Where Disney's God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

[Chorus]

In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be
I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline

Oh we heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We've fallen in and I can't pull back

Elton John,"I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night

Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight

This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it

I wouldn't have you any other way

Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where Joey Gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside

I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right

If I was a sculptor ha, but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgettin', but these things I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is the song

Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm still standing
(Yeah yeah yeah)

Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time

Elton John,"I hear you singing, ""I Shall Be Released""
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
But that's all right, that's ok
Grab the bottle and slide my way
You dreamt of a devil down below
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth

Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green

Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

One big sun coming up
Old moon going down
Thunder breaking in the east
I'm gonna love you 'til it comes around

Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day",The Best Part of the Day
Elton John,"I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true
You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day

And life is good

Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm gonna do
Now I feel the beat

And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still

Elton John,"You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes",Eight Hundred Dollar Shoes
Elton John,"Luther left us first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye
They're gonna have to share the weight together
Idle hands will see a good farm slowly die

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh
Hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh
Time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly

The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road
His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh

When flags and bullets start to fly

When Sherman comes their way",Gone to Shiloh
Elton John,"I'm out here in the darkness
I hear the howling wind
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Will I ever see love again?

Looking for an answer
Not an easy thing to find
Out here in the wilderness
With questions on my mind

Now the sun is rising higher in the sky
The morning light is crawling
From the darkness of the night
The raindrops keep on falling

There is no light of day
The sadness deep inside me
Doesn't seem to go away

And there's no way out, no road home
I'm lost in doubt and I'm all alone
The time has come
When love is done
Hearts have finally turned to stone

No more bright tomorrow, only sad today
My heart is filled with sorrow
The pain won't go away
Try to keep from crying

All night long and through the day
Lost and all alone
Hearts have finally turned to stone

No more bright tomorrow, only sad today
My heart is filled with sorrow
The pain won't go away
Just tryin' to keep from crying
All night long and through the day

Lost and all alone
Hearts have finally turned to stone",Hearts Have Turned to Stone
Elton John,"It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way

No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down
And a sign on the wall says, ""Hope Allowed""

All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight

Elton John,"Are you standing outside?
Looking up at the sky
Cursing a wandering star
Well if I were you
I'd throw rocks at the moon
And I'd say, ""Damn you wherever you are""

I don't know where to start
This cage round my heart
Locked up what I meant to say
What I felt all along the way
Just wondering how come
I couldn't take your breath away

[Chorus]
'Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
And I should have sent roses
When you crossed my mind
For no other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should have sent roses

Looking back on my life
If fate should decide
I could do it all over again
I'd build no more walls
I'd stay true and recall
The fragrance of you on the wind

You'll get better than me
Someone who can see
Right from the start give it all that you need
And I'll slip away
Knowing I'm half the man I should be

Should have sent roses",I Should Have Sent Roses
Elton John,"I knew from the first night I met you
Something just wasn't quite right
Loving like an innocent stranger
But somethin' was just out of sight

How could I know that you abused me
Fill out some plan of your own
I couldn't know you'd abuse me
Leave me here hurt and alone

If it wasn't for you I'd be happy
If it wasn't for lies you'd be true
I know that you could be just like you should
If it wasn't for bad you'd be good

I only saw what I wanted to see
You were a dream in my mind
I'll never know how you really could be
It didn't take long for me to find

I guess that it's my fault for seeing
Only what I wanted to see
I couldn't know you were being
A player just acting for me

I could have died
I could have given up
And not tried
To make it to tomorrow

Like a brokenhearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken

It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor

Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places
I needed to go

All of the people
I needed to know
They knew who I needed
And who needed me
And who would come help me

And who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say

When you're in the hands of angels
Life is oh so sweet
And you feel the love
Down deep inside
Even out there on the street

In the hands of angels",In the Hands of Angels
Elton John,"I'm looking at a funeral wagon rolling down
A two-lane highway winding past a desert town
A big blue canvas painted by the Master's hand
The shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand

In that mirror maybe that's what's left of me
Wheezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel
Air 'em out's the best release and get some rest
Carrie don't wait up for me the brakeman's going West

[Chorus]
In this room all alone
I dream of you
In this drawer I found someone
I never knew

Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian
I've seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads
A black face carny showman scare a song to death

In my short life I've seen as much as most men need
Now I'm just looking for some cleaner air to breathe

[Chorus]

Far away, far away

All along this broken land
I've seen a lover's empty arms
And hunger's empty hand

Elton John,"If you're looking for the glory
You think that you might find
In a bullet-riddled stolen car
On a back road in the pines
If it's round just like a medal
Or a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer

[Chorus]
Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit

Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill

Don't step away
Don't give up that tune
That you never could play

If every bone rattles
Through nights all alone
Well you're tougher than leather
No old burlap sack
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Growing up through the cracks

Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody

Don't think you've gone out
Don't flicker and fade
If you're gonna get lemons
Then you do what they say
The wind makes you weary
It knocks you around

Logs on the fire
Beats sun shining down
But you're harder than nails
No skinny old tack
You're still sharp as a razor
And I like you like that

There's only today

We've heard it before
We end up no question
Outside of death's door

To the question at hand
So easy to ask
And not understand

It's just the way it goes
Word is out, silence seems so loud
There's no light above or below me now
I've seen it grow, I've seen it live
I've seen everything I give
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with

And nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh when love is dying

There's a pain you never can explain
It cuts so deep time and time again
I felt it then, I feel it now
But nobody told me how
To fight a world of hurt
Somebody help me now

But love never gets to show you
And I never got to know you
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying
No and love never makes it easy
And I never got that feeling
No we never stood a chance
When love was dying

Elton John,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes

Elton John,"The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

_____ on the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom

You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love",Candlelit Bedroom [*]

The warm forgiving smiles

Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew

And the dancers danced on through

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

Grunts a word or two
Keeps 'em guessin' every night
Is he really gonna make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slavin'

Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire

Looking for your face with mine

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile

You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight",Can't Stay Alone Tonight
Elton John,"Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd,
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board

You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view, from the diving board

Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board.

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its noise

But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets aline
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me?

And full of the world and its noise

Elton John,"I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died?
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eyes
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight

Elton John,"I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload

So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent

I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand

Elton John,"Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

I was shaking with a fever

Elton John,"I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion

Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

Oceans away, where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves.
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away, oceans away

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay

Elton John,"Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed, you never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner

And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons

And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all",Oscar Wilde Gets Out
Elton John,"Spare the rod, don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last

Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow 'em all to Kingdom Come

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

Search out days, that never end
If it's only for the chance to feel
Just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

Elton John,"Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece
Of iron inside my truck
The boy just whispered OK
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog

Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
Gone to California
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house

Elton John,"I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse

I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new

And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart

I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout

I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war

And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Voyeur, voyeur, voyeur",Voyeur
Elton John,"Figuring out where I went wrong
The script not followed, then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not acting up

I wore the world upon my back
Thought someone else but me, pick up the slack
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinking 'bout
Time is wasted looking back

Now I'm looking up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

To claim his great reward

Hand over my heart and say a prayer

Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold

Someday if you're asking all about the key to love

Elton John,"Had some good times jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing

And watch the world go by

To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America (England and America)

The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

All my sweet sins stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
I'm rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

Was your bloom just what to watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high

Well I'm free now, free and easy

As lifeless demons without soul

Do you breathe-in dreams?
What spurred you to come here?

Did they really know?

And leave far away""

My motionless stance-in my mind, I wander the land

I'm trapped without guards, within a scare I can't Grasp
But we're still free

The home they want to call province of rome
Scared to move, scared to wake, scared just to be who we were
What matters is just you and me and the path that leads us...

Encircled by fiends, the pressure deepens dazed by illusions,
My reason weakens but I won't let you fall into deep forlornness
I won't let you ponder the why in distress
A mechanical smile as I lift my face towards the sun
And return to denial

I weep as I kiss the ground, the trees that I'll soon miss

And from the treetop of an oak
He laughed at people down beneath

With his eyes travelling over the scene (so strange)
He could mind-trace the flow
None of them realise something shared beyond
It's like a lighthouse from the port
Leading the boats to their quay

[Chorus:] Lone but ",The Dweller of Rhymes
Elvenking,"Oh pick up flutes and fiddles, a new tune is beginning
A melody forsaken, on the chords of our elders' song
Each note is telling a story, a fragment of existence
Oh people ye who listen, sit down and hear the old man's story

He was standing right in front of me, few steps from where I've been
That day the manor's tower is hiding a sun in agony
Filthy and soiled from head to feet, his sword was rusty and ruined
But in his eyes I caught a fleeting glimpse of his pride

[Bridge:] He said...
""Seven ",Oakenshield
Elvenking,"Gentlemen and ladies all please lend me your attention
I beg your pardon for my cheek, please join this heathenreel
Strange rules has this dance; suffers from a serious allergy
Reddens and becomes so unkind, when people're

acting just like you

The regal dance's about to start and I am here to tell you
""There's many a slip twixt cup and lip"" 'tis something

that could help you

On and on please join the ball, nobody will stop you
The steps they are so simple, look the moon is dancing too

Drink a toast with the wise man, no one will care for you
Let the dances have their go, follow 'till they reach the end
Mind the minstrels they will say you're just another scarecrow
Not a word a single word, not for all the

whole damn world (you say...)

[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot in heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin

I came I saw, do not want nothing at all,

do not want to moralise you
Or spitting hateful sentences, just trying to tease

your rudimental pride
""Live and let live"" told the wise man, as no one cared for him
From the soil which is now part of...""leaving is so

easier than living"" (he says...)

[Chorus:]
Step out of this regality dance
One foot into heaven, one in your grave
Mind this last one, it shall make you fall
A regardful bow
When your every single choice is
Taken by the spin of a penny coin

Bienvenu Mesdames et Messieurs
To the Danse Paien
Please come in and hurry up or
You will miss your turn

[Solos: Jarpen, Aydan]

[Chorus (x2):]

Face the truth are you worthy of this honesty filled - celebration!
Another tune bursting forth from the passion that

glides in my veins - can you feel it?
A speaking portrait's in front of me, do you acknowledge yourself? -

who painted you?

The crackling of the dead leaves counts the steps

",Seasonspeech
Elvenking,"At night I heard the owls say :
""Find the truth beneath the stars
You'll have to travel back to heaths of green...

...The entrance to the oak woods will be revealed to you
A king will tell you to ride until...""

[Bridge:]
... the leaves on the trees from black colour turn to green
There to find the oak woods I seek, where the old oaks still speak

At night I heard the old king say:
""To find your journey through the dark
You'll have to travel on a field of green""

Through time dark landscapes leave their place to grasslands of joy
Bestowed to ancient oak woods here I ...

[Bridge2:]
... stand astonished by green, light of power covers me
To understand the nature of man I have now to speak with the trees.

In my life I always prayed the ancients acting with pure honesty
This is time to face the truth so here I go

Running through the woods I question every plant and every tree
Searching for the answer that was promised to me
Then the full moon comes out and the wind whispers in my ear :
""Ask for White Willow near the Silver Lake""...

[Chorus:]
-The fire in my heart was burning like the flames of ancient times
White Willow with his knowledge opened up my eyes
-The vision of the world I had before was based on thousand lies
White Willow taught me how to live my life with truth

And there it stands the only White Willow tree
He embraced me and he told me to gaze at the stars!

The wise old tree twice spoke to me and he said :
""Bring truth to the ones that you trust
And make them believe that I still exist""
So he closed his eyes and I traveled back home

Back to my world, home I return :
And the birds cry out ""The old king has died""
With tears in my eyes I follow my heritage :
Now I am to be new Elvenking!

[Chorus2:]
-Green power light was flowing down my eyes like

waters from the falls
White Willow filled my heart with lore I now recall (lore I now recall!)
-The black horizons once I saw now turn to white as I pass by
And now I know why man can't bear to know the nature of the truth

Elvenking,"[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

At dawn the ships arrived, they sailed
Through seas and foreign skies
To bring another age in lands
That needed no constraints
By the sign of the fire,
All pagan gods were bleeding
To dispossess thousands years
Of wisdom and beliefs, oh

Think for a moment, fall astray
First step on sand, meant the last
Of their old life
(""now it's done, all is gone""), so pure,
With dignity all was carried on
""What's this fighting for?""

""Disappearing sands, familiar voices
Everytime I stare at the night inside us
All the places I cherish darken
Past memories are the only
True consolation
For what my eyes are forced to see""

The tears in her eyes were like rain
Come from the gloomiest cloud
Pushed back from their own homes,
The germ of hate seized the heart
In a clear warm spring day,
His spirit left the body
Alone she stood while the ravens
Flew away from ruins, oh

""Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us
Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us""

""My life for you, despair on us,
Despair on us""

Everytime I stare at the night inside us
All the places I cherish darken

",Disappearing Sands
Elvenking,"[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

Follow again one single piece
Of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
Chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
So deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
What's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
It can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
From emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

[Solo: Aydan]
[Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both]

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
Retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
A fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
That leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced
The illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new
Worlds





",A Fiery Stride
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

I was told by my Grandma'
Many years ago, I was just a child
""Boy, go and grow as an honest man
Look on what you've done with pride!""

The years have passed I'm a normal lad
I won't be named in school treatises
But looking back on what I've done
Yes, there's a glimpse of pride!

The losers' ball - Dance with me
To the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
Sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies and despair)

If you have time send a message
To every form of human life
""Hey out there if someone listens
This way we won't survive!""

We'll be drawn in arrogance
Hanged by the noose of greed
A new religion of violence
A bible of bad deeds

The losers' ball - Dance with me
To the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
Sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies-lust-despair)





",The Loser's Ball
Elvenking,"[Music:Aydan, Damnagoras / Lyrics: Aydan]

I built a cradle for the Moon
And from her chariot (she) grants my
Boon - I'll keep my promises, I'm sure
She won't betray me

I'm bathed in her pale lightfall
Perceiving like a distant call
She whispers in my ears
Riddles I don't understand

Enchanted by thy serene glow
Oh, silent Lady let me know
Of arcane doctrines and secrets
To be not revealed

You doodle Night with stains of stars
Shining arabesques so far

Recite your rhymes, and tell me how to

Find my way -
Through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind

Painted in the sky,
As magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on ",Moonchariot
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

Stand before the new born kind

There is a song, taken far by the winds

A rhyme of poets, a melody
Wrapped in a dream
The elvensong has gone, to another realm

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for new scents
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

Singing our song, we went abreast
We plunged into a deeply cloven track
May the stars shine
Upon the end of road, now you can't tide

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for emotions
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

If you can't express what you feel within
Remember not only words can speak
If a pen killed more than sword
Let this tune be your own word!

A new journey begins each time
(hear my call)
You draw lotsfor new things to find
We are willing to endure the chance

Lay down no bounds...

",Pathfinders
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics Aydan]

And this journey begins --
With the beat of wings of lark
Her wake ravishing - skyforged spark
Gold-leaves are falling, all beasts are
Howling, the signs are clear!

The forces are near -
The crows say that someone will die
Embraces and fear - they tell no lies
Searching for new roads, sacrifice your
Blood, the signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining in
Fading lights
May you read the meanings, it's your lot

The journey comes to an end -
The lark plunged with sun into sea
All you love and defend -
Belongs to you and me
Pagan traditions of forgotten missions,
The signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining
In fading lights
May you read the meanings

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Search for the fibres,
The dwelling light net of Wyrd
Roaming souls on branch of Mother Earth





",The Perpetual Knot
Elvenking,"[Music: Aydan, Jarpen / Lyrics: Aydan]

[DAWN: Fragments of star]

It's simply too hard
To blow out all these fragments of star
The dawn never shines
I'm condemned to this eternal night

Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight it enriches my life, it
Holds me spellbound

It crawls all inside
It's the wish to back down and hide
Like the calm sea
It's the haven of forces within

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

[DAY: Autumn runes]

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone, symbols of my childhood
Gone, on the wind floats a dream
And hundreds of my broken promises
And oaths
Taken by the stream, artefacts of what I
Was

Read the signs on the trees,
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades,
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

Another night has passed, and with it all
The fears and dreads are gone,
And the shadows have faded

Clouds are leaving the sky, the horizon
Point out new ways to be found,
There is always a trail to follow, and it will
Take you home

Follow all the scents
Before light passes away
Long before the shadows fall
As covering miles in the distance
You will see
What you searched,
You will catch sight of your dreams
Dwelling forevermore, wander aimlessly

It's the fatal falling, on the path we
Choose
We're searching for answers
That never appear
We're searching for lands beyond
All limits, we're falling!

Millions of emotions (have) passed
Through my heart since I'm on this Earth
But the ones that remain are the ones
We're living for

[Repeat Bridge & Chorus]

[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen, both]

[TWILIGHT: The chant of the first snow]

It's the sweetest Night of all
It's a moment that lengthens
To eternity and more
While the flakes soundless will fall
I hear the sound of laugther
Coming from so high above
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

It's the Night of cruel remorse
It remains only a distant memory
Of things undone
A return to innocence
A travel back in time when everything
Seems clear and pure
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

[DEEP NIGHT: The Dreamcurse]

Cursed, cursed
That lone and threadlike figure
So shapelessly unbounded
Will haunt that empty jar
That is me

Cursed, cursed
I'm deep into transparency
A dreamy spiral staircase
A voice, a whisper echo in the gloom

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
I sharpen all my sleeping senses
Encircle my own wish
I'll never die!

Cursed, cursed
A gloomy sense of sadness
Impaled my arid heart
To the sceptre of melancholy

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
On the stroke of my halfhour
The token has been shown
Eternal wearing the Red Death masque!

Thousand ways of living
In the end (I) got my reward
I don't feel alone no more

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes
While you're holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

...and finally is day again...

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone,
Symbols of my childhood gone,
On the wind floats a dream and hundreds
Of my broken promises and oaths
Taken by the stream,
Artefacts of what I was

Read the signs on the trees,
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades,
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

It's the fatal falling,
On the path we choose
We're searching for answers
That never appear
We're searching for lands beyond
All limits, we're falling!





",A Poem for the Firmament
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

Long the shores of a silent stream
I'm picking up pieces of my life
Finding out I was living my own dream
Beginning once again

I searched for themes
That I never knew before
It's like roaming a forest in winter
Searching buds buried in snow
I learnt new languages,
New forms to proclaim
All the will to be so sincere,
Not lying to myself again

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
Leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key, it's still for me

One by one the lights fade out
The fright-night covers all with her cloak
You cannot name the colour of the dark
I fall into a dream

From the lands lying at the end of World
I am bringing this dress as a gift, it is
Made with the purest silk
She smiled at me,
She never wore the dress
Touching the fabric was like holding
Nothing in your hand

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
Leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key

Hold my hand - 'till the sun set off
I'm proud of what I've done
At least the days I've spent are so totally
Unique





",The Silk Dilemma
Elvenking,"I look around myself I'm feeling like a stranger to this world. 
Where are the friends once I got (as) I used to know?
No trace of common sense, a dash of a normal sanity. 
I wonder: ""Are they all mad? ... or is it me?""

[Chorus]
Thousands years have passed
And nothing gonna change
Marching the plains as loud 
As hell they're coming
Drawn up in lines, proud their eyes,
The army of the fools
Ruling the thrones, it conquered and won

I'm getting older,
Maybe I don't recognize I'm yet too old
For all this mind-blowing fair of insanity
When I was a kid I promised to myself I'd never grow up. 
But now wiser a bit I can see!

[Chorus]

Follow me, don't promise to be
What you never had thought you'd have wanted to be. 
Tell me I'm wrong but I follow myself. 
And the dreams that I've lived since I was born

[Chorus]",March of Fools
Elvenking,"I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams

When I take a walk outside, whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice, a hundred times or more

They shout, they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end

The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The rose is so strong but
It wonÂ't be Â'till the end, NO!

I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams

When I take a walk outside, whispers will surround my head

They shout, they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end

The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The roses, so fragile, forever will fade away with the tide of life
But this night will hold them on!

Chorus:
Oh, I want to see when I was a child
All the emotions, the smiles and the cries
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights
Remember the flash, the crowd was no more
A light that surrounds you, never before
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights

At the end of this horrid night, whispers stopped to haunt my dreams
All emotions cast inside my mind, a hundred times or more... no more...




",Neverending Nights

On the first day of the season, when the moon will shine full in the sky.
I will wait for you there bathed by a magic light.
I will wait, I will pray for this moment to become alive

For this night I will see you as an elf clad in leaves. 
You are going to see myself the fairy of your secret dreams
Even if all this belongs to worlds of fantasy. 
For this time, only this night everything is fair, belongs to me

A single flake for all the good ones.

The lands are dressed in the purest white. 
Pure as I was and I am no more

The ones of you who are free of guilt
Wound me with your stones and then step in. 
Buried in the whitest snow I will suddenly awake. 
The winter wake

I spend my time gazing at the stars
As silently it snows inside my heart
Someone said that life brings and then takes. 
The winter wake",The Winter Wake
Elvenking,"Two sided heart pushing to face
Another walk from the start
Shifting my soul to what was heaven before
And now's just a stain, a novelty no more

Passion and soul together
Deceiving my brain and I fall
But soon they will fade delighted by something else
And now I rewind, one more time

Waiting for
All the feeling's now in vain
The divided heart

Tearing me apart the divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away, carried away, yeah

Your blood is mine, the shivers it's sending me
Just right through my spine
We're gonna crawl, splitting my heart in two
And haunting my soul, illusioned no more

Passion and soul together
Deceiving my brain and I fall
But soon they will fade delighted by something else
And now I rewind, one more time

Waiting for the lights to fade away
All the feelings now in vain
The divided heart

Tearing me apart the divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away, carried away

Tearing me apart the divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away, carried away

The tears that I don't cry
Won't fill my eyes but pain inside
I feel is real, pain is real
Until the day I'll die

For divided heart

Tearing me apart the divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away, carried away

Oh carried, carried away
Carried away, away

",The Divided Heart
Elvenking,"Amidst this fog my body twitches with the wolves growl
A snuff utopia for the soul
Wake up, emerging from this cruel poetry
The real nightmare is the prison called reality

I have seen too much waste of lives
Being thrown into the fire
No way, I'm gonna set you free

You come to me with a piece of your shadow pretending to see
Sown in my flesh the seed of your hatred's infecting me
Woah, dark embrace, cold embrace, sweet embrace unfolding
Seeking for the end not written in your destiny
This is not the cure and now I spill, I spill on your deception

Back to old Hill Life Sanitarium I go
My home, my life, the only place I know
No mirror holding the reflection of the emotions I feel
And puppets hanging from the walls I see

I have seen too much waste of lives
Being thrown into the fire
No way, I'm gonna set you free

You come to me with a piece of your shadow pretending to see
Sown in my flesh the seed of your hatred's infecting me
Woah, dark embrace, cold embrace, sweet embrace unfolding
Seeking for the end not written in your destiny
This is not the cure and now I spill, I spill on your infection

I spill on your deception, I spill on your infection
I spill on your deception, I spill on your infection
I spill on your infection
Sown in my fresh the seed of your hatred's infecting me

I have seen to much waste of lives
Being thrown into the fire
No way, I'm gonna set you free

You come too me with a piece of your shadow pretending to see
Sown in my flesh the seed of your hatred's infecting me
Woah, dark embrace, cold embrace, sweet embrace unfolding
Seeking for the end not written in your destiny
This is not the cure and now I spill, I spill on your infection

The puritan filth, where ivy grows
The poisoned tear, the thorn, the rose

Elvenking,"Strange the breeze, late the season comes
As beats late the clock of my heart
Falling leaves color all around
As my intentions stroking the ground

And up they have seen the skies
Pains and joys of so many lives
All griefs your empty glance

Waters of the ocean tell her I am near
Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

Painted into the setting sun
A black shadow ringed in red flames
Handsome as words cannot describe
Ruthless as her blinded black eyes

And up they have seen the skies
Pains and joys of so many lives
All griefs your empty glance

Waters of the ocean tell her I am near
Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

I don't fear for my fate what really does ache
Is a false thought of home
No one ever will be in control of his end

By her tears and her pain
I'm eternally damned memories of a life
Nothing can ever be done to avoid my last touch

Waters of the ocean tell her I am near
Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

On that strange and silent night on lost hill of the memories
I've spoken of love and touched, she smiled to me
To me, smiled to me

For all the ones who seek their dawn
My wrath I breed, my wrath I spawn
Behind a crooked cross they hide
Forever I shall be their bride

",Lost Hill of Memories
Elvenking,"On this night of nights, she's coming my way
Under this rain, dirty with agony and pain
Mistress of doom, winner of all fights
My glance is reflected in the blade of the scythe

A sparkling golden sickle
Mows down souls whistling in the air
Reddens little by little
The seas of life and mankind's lairs

A fall into the abyss
Deep into agony and pain
Spiral down to the anguish
It has been all in vain, all in vain, go

Welcome, please join the fair of failures
Enter into the hall of pleasures
Righteous the act to kill
Or wasn't it one of God's wills?

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Another name to be carved
For every slash of my blade
Until the day you find
The one reflected is your face

Come, taste blood, rust and terror
Come to the show with no restraint
It's your time

The mother of desperation
Death of thunder and rain
Sighs and tears are all in vain
Clad in a cloak of despair
She'll take you away

Welcome, please join the fair of failures
Enter into the hall of pleasures
Righteous the act to kill
Or wasn't it one of God's wills?

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Hold your ground and watch your back
With the aim of remaining the last
I asked this night for a piece of advice
This time the scythe won't fall, keep still

Still
Still

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Hold your ground and watch your back
With the aim of remaining the last

This time the scythe won't fall, keep still

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

And if you follow the trails down this winter wake
She's reaping down souls, one for every flake
Throughout the ages, through centuries
She, mistress of customs of memories

A heaven that I've never known.

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Elvira Madigan,"Through the woods between stem and bark
Blackened by an eerie sky a moonlit night
High on her heels above the icecold snow
Thunders demons thrilled by the chase

To be the one to hunt her down
To seize the price for the damage done
And bring this DemiGod to justice
Before the Grand Duke of Hell
(And of her life as well)
Little pity will be shown for her insubordination
... Be gone!

Two thousand souls on killing spree
Yet the first to reach her is struck by pity
And to his Lord and Master he means no disrespect
In letting her go...

There is but many who die this day
As the most crestfallen of angels are slain

The wrath bestowed on them all
Is tenfold greater than Heavens Fall
When the dearest of possessions are lost
For the folly of one apprentice

There is no pain severe enough
No sentence matching the crime that has been done
Here

... Finally... She is free...
... To roam the earth...
... And all of the above!




",Crestfallen
Elvira Madigan,"Falling by numbers before my very eyes
The Kin of the Dragons I've slain by birthright
And seer grant me courage for I know not the peril
That lie ahead down my twisted path

... So rise, oh Lord...
... Grant me strength, to uphold...
Thy kingdom to come
Thy death be undone
Sleep no longer

For the land below both King and foe
Awaits this final day
And though fear roams I do know, I do understand
What must be done...

Be seated, be afraid for what may come this way
For behind these shutters and behind these doors
Our story's about to unfold

I gather the will to end my mission
With the seven witches tied at the stakes
And as the audience is ghasping for air
I prepare to revel in the flesh
And now the feast is here, as the maidens fair
Are cleansed by the flames

Preordained
As I falter by every word
Summoning all but the Lord himself
For as the shape reveals as prophesied in the ""good book""
It all seams somewhat twisted to what I've
Learned to believe to be the man not the beast
I've (now) somehow succumbed to without
Knowing what made me sacrifice
All that's dead to be by the hand of the Lord

... Oh Lord why have you turned on me?

... Oh Lord you sought me out
Behind this curtain of my everyday life
And now it seams the only one to die
Is me...

Elvira Madigan,"[Narrator:]
Evil perished the day
Or so they thought when there stood in pale
On trial with hands tied to her back
All but a child told to be taught of herecy

[The Onlooker:]
The demons in cloaks arrive and light the pyres high
Whilst hiding behind the doctrine built on scriptures of lies

The wicked Kindred watch with pride
With the icon of their malice at side
None here will regret today
As virtue ends up lost in flames

[The Elders Of The Village:]
So You've come here to slay all the witches?
On Your mission straight from God
To justify Your faith it seems our women at the stakes must die

[The Onlooker & The Wise Man:]
Tears all mingle with her blood
Does fall for the teachings from above
With torture meant to drive us all to the shackles of their lies
For all are sinners in the eyes of God
Until we all belong to the likes of Him
(With devine right) To see to it that all nonebelievers die

[High Priest To His Loyal Subjects:]
Bring them to their knees
For to spread the gospels the best tool is fear of God
And all the sins we do create to keep them all at bay
And have them pay in blood and finally their beliefs

[The Inquisitors To The Villagers:]
In this year of our Lord, by the grace of our hordes
We have come to save You from Your afterlife
Though most of You will die, be sure though to abide
Salvation lies after a lifetime of submission

[The Villagers:]
Are we to pay in blood and all our wealth
For plain intimidation of this hell?
When facing all the wealth we here possess
This image of Your God seems so much less

[With Hindsight:]
But we were given no choice.

Hon ler och undrar över tiden hon ligger här

Men när tiden är knapp

Och ingen vet vem han är

Sen den dagen de han kom, släpptes djävulen så lös
Han får varje flickas gunst, han belägrar varje tös
Sedan ondskan kom till byn blir den skörd av allt dom ser

",Jacob's Ladder
Elvira Madigan,"I looked to the North, and I turned to the West,
For a sign, a light in the sky,
Oh the message is clear, that the time is near,
For a leader to come again

A circle of stones on the head of a hill,
Tonight is where it will be,
In this desolate place, we all stand and wait,
For a leader to come again, yes a leader will come again

For it is written, that a leader will be here,
And then a vision, left me blinded by the light,
And it started right in front of my eyes",The Leader
Elvira Madigan,"There's a Spanish train that runs between
Quadalquivir and old Seville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people fear she's running still

And then they hush their children back to sleep
Lock the doors, upstairs they creep
For it is said that the souls of the dead
Fill that train ten thousand deep!!

Well a railwayman lay dying with his people by his side
His family were crying, knelt in prayer before he died
But above his head just awaiting for the dead
Was the Devil with a twinkle in his eye
Well God's not around and look what I've found this one's mine

Just then the Lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light
And shouted at the devil Get thee hence to endless night
But the Devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
But there's no need to push me around,
I got him first so you can do your worst
He's going underground

But I think I'll give you one more chance
Said the Devil with a smile
So throw away that stupid lance
It's really not your style
Joker is the name
Poker is the game
We'll play right here on this bed,
And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet
The souls of the dead
And I said Look out, Lord, he's going to win,
The sun is down and the night is riding in,
That train is dead on time
Many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, he's going to win

Well the railwayman he cut the cards
And he dealt them each a hand of five
And for the Lord he was praying hard
For that train he'd have to drive
Well the Devil he had three aces and a king
And the Lord he was running for a straight
He had the queen and the knave and the nine and ten of spades
All he needed was the eight

And then the Lord he called for one more card
But he drew the diamond eight
And the Devil said to the son of God
I believe you've got it straight
So deal me one for the time has come
To see who'll be the king of this place
But as he spoke from beneath his cloak
He slipped another ace

Ten thousand souls was the opening bid
And it soon went up to fifty-nine
But the Lord didn't see what the Devil did
And he said that suits me fine
I'll raise you high to hundred and five
And forever put an end to your sins
But the Devil let out a mighty shout, My hand wins

And I said Lord, oh Lord, you let him win
The sun is down and the night is riding in
That train is dead on time, many souls are on the line
Oh Lord, don't let him win

Well that Spanish train still runs between
Quadalquivir and old Seville
And at dead of night the whistle blows
And people hear she's running still

And far away in some recess
The Lord and the Devil are now playing chess
The Devil still cheats and wins more souls
And as for the Lord, well, he's just doing his best

They wear that good look grin
I gotta break out one weekend

Try to do somebody in
But every single time
I feel a little stronger

Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then I know you're bound to see my other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I get edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you

But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you

Oh, don't you know I'm human?
I've got my faults just like anyone
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done

Yet everybody loves you so much, girl
I just don't know how you stand the strain
Oh, I, I'm the one who's here tonight

Can`t they see we're tryin' to have a party party party party

The fine music that you hear is by Stravinsky

Oh, don't tell me that she's dead, mama

Elvis Costello,"I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas,
And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.
I wonder if they grew up hating the season,
The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen

For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

[Chorus]
There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.

Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.

With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.

And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

I hear them saying
And it gets better every day
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day

All these facts leave me in the swim
It's down and down there is no up

Tomorrow's just another day

And it gets better every day
I hear them saying
Tomorrow's just another day

There is a chance if I move around
I need a moment to reflect
On the friendships I have wrecked.
Why is it I (?) don't I always try?

They're so teddy bear tender and tragically hip 
I'm never going to cry again 
I'm going to be as strong as them

I wonder who he's gonna stick it in this time
Everyone was looking for a little entertainment
So they'll probably pull his hands off when they find out his name
And then they shut down the power all along the line
And we got stuck in the tunnel where no lights shine

Now he'd like to go to Spain or somewhere like that
With his two-tone Bible and his funny cigarettes
His suntan lotion and his castanets

Long shot at that jumping sign
Invisible shivers running down my spine
Cut to baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says ""We never close""
He snatches at you and you match his cigarette
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet

Someone's scratching at the window, I wonder who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Don't get cute
Just like watching the detectives
I get so angry when the teardrops start

It's just that everybody has to feel his pain
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

He's getting down on his knees
He finds that her brother's not so easy to please, oh, oh
After all, his rights were just a paper striptease
She's caught it like some disease

If he says ""No dancing""
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my own

She can't even speak to him, he can't face her now

All I ever do is bow
So now do you see, how can it be?
Why can't you give me anythin' but sympathy?""

You can't let those kind of feeling show.
I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you,
But I've still got a long way to go.
Why don't we call it a day, and we can both confess.
You can force me to use a little tenderness.

You only asked me why
I never thought that so much trouble
Was restin' on my reply

I could tell by the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one who'd come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know it's the way that you walk

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?

Baby's gotta have the things she wants
You know she's gotta have the things she loves
She's got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves

And I'm doing everything just tryin' to please her
Even crawling around on all fours
Oh, I thought by now that it was gonna be easy
But she still seems to want for more

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Oh yeah

Never given you a bad reputation
Just because you've never been denied
You try to say you've done it all before
Baby, you know that you just get tired

Yet everybody loves you so much, girl
I just don't know how you stand the strain
Oh I-I'm the one who's here tonight
And I don't want to do it all in vain

Why do you have to say there there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?

Elvis Costello,"Romeo was restless, he was ready to kill
He jumped out the window 'cause he couldn't sit still
Juliet was waiting with a safety net
He said, ""Don't bury me 'cause I'm not dead yet""

Why don't you tell me about the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me
'Cause I've tried and I've tried, and I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

Well, I remember when the lights went out
And I was tryin' to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew, and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing, but we didn't know how to do it

[Chorus:]

Well, I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Tryin' to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But what's the use of looking when you don't know what they mean?

There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing

Now he's telling her every little thing he's done
Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks
Now he's read every one
He's such a drag (he's such a drag)
He's not insane (he's not insane)
It's just that everybody has to feel his pain
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

He's getting down on his knees
He finds that her brother's not so easy to please, oh, oh
After all, his nights were just a paper striptease
She's caught it like some disease

If he says ""No dancing""
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my own

She can't even speak to him, he can't face her now
He says, ""Even though I want to shake your hand
All I ever do is bow
So now do you see, how can it be?
Why can't you give me anythin' but sympathy?""

If home is anywhere that I can hang my hat
Then it`s coming apart at the seams
My luck is hanging upside down

And love slips right out of sight

And these bones, they don`t look so good to me
Jokers talk and they all disagree
One day soon, I will laugh right in the face of the poison moon

You look in the mirror
I`m sorry, but it can`t be replaced
You`re thrown straight out in that cruel parade
Buttoned down and laced
It starts like fascination, it ends up like a trance

You can't let those kind of feelings show
I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you
But I've still got a long way to go

Why don't we call it a day, and we can both confess
You can force me to use a little tenderness
White lies, alibis, now anything but say that it's true
Now we could sit like lovers, staring in each other's eyes

So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?

Elvis Costello,"My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable

Is your mouth a little weak?

Are you smart?

Elvis Costello,"This never was one of the great romances
But I thought you'd always have those young girl's eyes
But now they look in tired and bitter glances
At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise

I get the feeling that I don't belong here
But there's no welcome in the window anyway
And I look down for a number on my key chain
'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday

There's a stranger in the house, nobody's seen his face
But everybody says he's taken my place
There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And now you say you've got no expectations
But I know you also miss those carefree days
And for all the angry words that passed between us
You still don't understand me when I say

Elvis Costello,"I'm the living result
Of a man who's been hurt a little too much
And I've tasted, the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel

I can't stand up from falling down
I can't stand up from falling down

Simple though love is still it confused me
Why I'm not loved the way I should be
Now I've lived with heartaches and I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair and I've wrestled with tears

I can't stand up from falling down
I can't stand up from falling down

The vow that we made
You broke it in two

Hope I never have to testify

Girl I stand accused
With no more than a chance
Yeah I stand accused
And I got no defense
All I need is a touch from your hand
Find myself on the witness stand
I'd be unable to lie girl
I got a love that won't die girl
Tell the world that I was guilty
I wouldn't stand a chance
Tell the world that I was a victim
A victim of circumstance

Girl knock myself out see if I could explain
Girl I love you so much that I'm almost insane
You disturbed my balance of mind
Couldn't help what I did at the time
I stand accused and I'm guilty

Elvis Costello,"Everyone is busy with the regular routine
The sniper just takes his aim
Everyone is window shopping, no one is amazed
Even if he hit you, you'd still think it's just a graze
You go to a movie, you go to a show
You think that you're loving, you don't really know

Big tears mean nothing
You can count them as they fall
Big tears mean nothing
When you're lying in your coffin
Tell me who's been taken in

Oh you talk about the new boss automatic clause
But of course they make it all up for you
Always fascinated by the weird edge of town
Come home disappointed every time they put you down
Laughing with the old boys, saying that it's all noise

I suppose, big tears mean nothing
You can count them as they fall
Big tears mean nothing
When you're lying in your coffin
Tell me who's been taken in

All the buttons of my overcoat
They have fallen off one by one
You wouldn't even like me if you'd never had a drink
You wouldn't even like me if you never stopped to think
Standing in the shadow, turning wives to widows

Don't you know, big tears mean nothing
You can count them as they fall
Big tears mean nothing
When you're lying in your coffin
Tell me who's been taken in
Tell me, who's been taken in
Tell me, who, me or yous been taken in

If you'd only put me back to back with that girl

With just a little lighting
There'll never be days like that again
When I was just a boy and men were men
You never go from moment to moment

You're the living double of a single fiction
You're very colorful with your compliments
As you feel the finger's friction
It's a freeze-frame
Still it's real life
You don't want to look
'Cause you've seen the film and you've read the book

I was looking at the black and white world
Trying to name some pin-up
Those days she was just a beautiful girl
Now she's framed and hung up

I thought she was young
Up until I saw her last night in close detail
Though they all fade away when you're so pale
It's more than just a physical attraction
It starts with a face and ends up a fixation
But you're never gonna feel a fraction

And a little limelight robbery

Stuck on the wall with a thousand faces
Unwanted posters of the haunted places

On foot speaks, the other answers

He plays a Spanish guitar
He got a black eye from a waitress

Deeds done in the darkest hours

Lying on a plate and I'm not
Buying my share of souvenirs

Beat up strangers who talk funny

Stylish slacks to suit your pocket
Back supports and picture lockets
Sleepy towns and sleeper trains
To the dogs and down the drains
Major roads and ladies smalls
Hearts of oak and long trunk calls

At death's door with life insurance

Better get it off your chest
Every day is just like the rest but Sunday's best

Sunday's best, Sunday's finest
When your money's in the minus
And you suffer from your shyness
You can listen to us whiners

Don't look now under the bed
An arm, a leg and a severed head
Read about the private lives
The songs of praise, the readers' wives
Listen to the decent people
Though you treat them just like sheep
Put them all in boots and khaki
Blame it all upon the darkies

Elvis Costello,"Here I am late again for the last time 
And like I promised, I just told her goodbye 
Please believe me 'cause this time, it's really over 
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie 
Didn't I come and tell you about her 
How temptation lured she and I 
Now I know it was only fascination 
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie 
I had to let her down easy as slow as I could 
After all, she's got feelings too 
But it took a little longer than I thought it would 
But this time, she knows we're really through 
She wanted to hold me forever 
And this lipstick shows her final try 
And these tears on my shoulder are proof that she failed 
And darling, you know I wouldn't lie","Darling, You Know I Wouldn't Lie"
Elvis Costello,"There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder
I thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder ?
Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't get any clearer
Oh, i just want to hear girls talk
I got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk
But I can't say the words you want to hear
I suppose you're going to have to play it by ear
Right here and now

Girls talk and they want to know how
Girls talk and they say it's not allowed
Girls talk, if they say that it's so
Don't you think that I know by now

That the word up on everyone's lips
Stick that you're dedicated
Though you may not be an old fashioned girl
You're still going to get dated
Was it really murder ?
Were you just pretending ?
Lately I have heard you are the living end

Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

But I thought you'd always have those young girl's eyes
But now they look in tired and bitter glances
At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise

I get the feeling that I don't belong here
But there's no welcome in the window anyway
And I look down for a number on my key chain
'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday

There's a stranger in the house, nobody's seen his face
But everybody says he's taken my place
There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And now you say you've got no expectations
But I know you also miss those carefree days
And for all the angry words that passed between us
You still don't understand me when I say

Elvis Costello,"Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless
Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not when the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be flowers and prayers that are sad, I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I am caressing you
With the last breath of my heart I'll be blessing you

But a home of your own would be shatterproof 

We papered over all the cracks and painted a cat's lick and a promise 
The landlord was a man of few words, and most of them were ominous 

[Chorus: x2]

It was nothing really to write home about 
Then one day it all appears too much 
Here comes my little hammer and its shatterproof touch 

He said, ""Be practical, 
These are most unreasonable demands. 
Forget about the broken spectacles and the damage to your hand."" 

[Chorus]",Shatterproof [*]
Elvis Costello,"I made my selection from the lonely hit parade
In the town where time stood still
I was feeling very little pain
Until some joker played ""Almost Persuaded""
Now every girl I see
Looks so much prettier to me
My faithfulness has faded
And their looks established daggers
And the conversation heated
Since the boys had all been late
I found them walking round defeated
In the town where time stood still

Somebody in charge must have pretended
The future's been suspended
And I say I don't want trouble
But I find myself back in it
In the town where time stood still
I am the man of the minute

Teach me to say ""I love you""
I'll teach you to say ""You will do""
In the town where time stood still
A way (?) that I can find a little girl
To wind me up with all the usual spells

There's nothing else to do but rearrange somebody's future
And check your figures in the till
The bar is full of girls just like the creature with the curse
And the food is just like cabaret and vice versa
In the town where time stood still
Just as my heart (went down) sinking
I found the town was shrinking

And suddenly I saw her through the smoke and empty beers
In the town where time stood still
She might have well have waited years

Now I suppose we did some things we used to do
But no amount of darkness could ever turn her into you

And so I woke up in the town where time stood still
With a headache and a heartache
And a handful of pills
A welcome mat, a scandal rag and unpaid bills

With her head inside her handbag
The sign says ""please wait to be seated""
I only want a cup of coffee
I know you can't have your cake and eat it
In the town where time stood still

Did you hear the news today?
It's all bad; they'll be howling after sunset
With a headache and a heartache
And an hour or two to kill
I only wish we were together...
In the town where time stood still

Elvis Costello,"Don't say a word, don't say anything
Don't say a word, I'm not even listening
I read in the papers about their escape

They're just two bits
Kids from a bunch of sour grapes
You better watch your step

Watch, who's knocking on your front door?
Now you know that they're watching
What are you waiting for? Think you're young and original
Get out before they'll get to watch your step

Everyday is full of fun and family spies
They're making heroes out of fall guys
They say it's good for business from Singapore to Widnes
You better watch your step

Broken noses hung up on the wall
Back slapping drinkers cheer the heavy weight brawl
So punch drunk they don't understand at all
You better watch your step

Every night
Go out full of carnival desires
End up in the closing time choirs

When you're kicking in the car chrome
And you're drinking down the Eau de Cologne
And you're spitting out the Kodachrome
You better watch your step

Bye, I send you all my regards
You're so tough, you're so hard
Listen to the hammers
Falling in the breaker's yard

You better watch your step
You better watch your step
Ooh, watch your step",Watch Your Step [Live][*]
Elvis Costello,"The family circle gather round from very far and near
To pass around the same remarks they passed away last year
The little girl you dangle on your knee without mishap
Stirs something in your memory
And something in your lap

But it`s a living
This is the life
For the world and his wife
The world and his wife

The kissing cousins slip outside to cuddle and confess
She says sweet nothing at all it`s much more of a mess
The conversation melts like chocolate down their open jaws
As the juniper berry slips down just like last night`s drawers

To tell the truth our mum ran off with someone else`s father
Went for two weeks` holiday in taramasalata
Daddy went out with the rubbish and he kept on walking
Between mum and the walls
God only knows who does the talking

But later on in the evening through the tears and fol de rol
Come the sentimental feelings for the lure of vitriol
Longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas
With a blindfold and a national anthem
Sung in different keys",The World and His Wife [Solo Version][*]
Elvis Costello,"In the Arrivederci Roma nightclub, bar and grill
Standing in the fiberglass ruins watching time stand still
All your troubles you confess
to another faceless backless dress
Schnapps Chianti porter and ouzo
Pernod vodka sambuca I love you so
Deportee

Tatty beauty talking in riddles
Rome burns down everybody's on the fiddle
Two thousand dollars for wife and some class
A thousand years drowned in a chaser glass
How I wish that she was mine
I could have been a King in Six Eight Time
Schnapps Chianti porter and ouzo
Pernod vodka sambuca I love you so
Deportee

It's a brittle charm but she's had enough
Still she wrote her number on his paper cuff
You don't know where to start or where to stop
All this pillow talk is nothing more than talking shop

When I came here tonight my pockets were overflowing
They took my return ticket without me even knowing
I pray to the saints and all the martyrs
For the secret life of Frank Sinatra
But none of these things have come to pass
In America the law is a piece of ass
I'm a deportee",The Deportees Club
Elvis Costello,"They took old Danny Boy for a ride from the arms of his bride to be
Threw him into the murky waters by the dog biscuit factory
Quick dry the tears and stifle cheers as he sinks just like a stone
Footprints set in sentimental cement now burden down his bones
Lest we forget, here lies The Great Unknown

My, my, my Delilah, who's the butcher that you harbor?
Take the rich man to the cleaners and the strong man to the barber
From her face down to her torso, sort of gruesome only more so
Hooks and eyes, fingers and thumbs
Ladies and gentlemen here she comes, The Great Unknown

Where shall we sing at a wedding or a wake?
Whose name shall we cherish and for whose sake?

Now this year's cannon fodder tell the future general's jokes
They were keeping the home fires burning as we slipped out for a smoke
Though the VIPs sang ""Wooden Heart"", the band played ""Hearts of Oak""

Where shall we sing at a wedding or a wake?
Whose name shall we cherish and for whose sake?

And here come the day, I shall perish all alone
Say here lies The Great Unknown",The Great Unknown
Elvis Costello,"I hung up the phone tonight
Just as you said I love you
Once this would have been coincidence
Now these things start to bother me
You still close your eyes when I kiss you
And I close mine too
But we didn't open them again
Quite as wide as we should

This is where the home truth ends
This is where the home truth ends

Does your touch feel the same as it should do
Or is it someone quite similar
Who killed me with kindness last night
Now do I look at all familiar?
But none of these things seem to matter
Since we've grown apart
I'd put back the pieces of what's shattered
But I don't know where to start

This is where the home truth ends
This is where the home truth ends

This is where the home truth ends
And I feel like a clown
It's tearing me up
It's tearing me down

You say which are the lies that you tell me
Well where do I begin?
So I turn on the TV again
And the world comes crashing in
Is it my shirt or my toothpaste
That is whiter than white?
Is it the lies that I tell you
Or the lies that I might?

This is where the home truth ends
This is where the home truth ends

This is where the home truth ends
This is where the home truth ends",Home Truth
Elvis Costello,"You can take a powder
You can take a drink
You can keep the shrink
And the kitchen sink
Write my name in heaven
In invisible ink
I just woke up from dreaming, I think

You can take me over
You can give me a lip
You can take me under
You can give me the slip
Take off everything or tear me off a strip
Like a lady in the chamber
And another in the clip

[Chorus]
Don't move a muscle baby
Don't even flinch
You can miss me by a mile
Or just inch by inch
Inch by inch
Inch by inch
Inch by inch
You can pull me up again
Inch by inch
Inch by inch
As pulses race
I long to see that look upon your face

You can take me outside
You can take me apart
You can take me upstairs
You can take me to heart
You made me love you when
You thought you were so smart
Don't try to stop me when
You told me to start

[Chorus]",Inch by Inch
Elvis Costello,"The children sit upon the stairs
High above a valley of tears
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no

Oh no Joe Porterhouse
Is not gone forever
He'll be back another day
Don't let them see you crying that way

[Chorus]
Please don't wake him let him sleep
It' s a moment she can keep
Like an old bus ticket or a photograph
Resting on the mantelpiece
While for the wicked there is no peace
She says it's not his time to go
Why we were nearly lovers years ago
Now what is left for me
Among the broken branches of the family tree

Heart like an anchor
Arms like cable
He stood all alone on an iron turntable
Don't let them see you crying that way oh no

The sun beats down
It's cracking the flags
Boys who should know better
Are stamping out fags
Don't let them see you laughing that way

Oh no Joe Porterhouse
Is not gone forever
He'll be back another day
Don't let them see you crying that way",Joe Porterhouse
Elvis Costello,"You lie so unfolded 
In a love field 
With your contempt for any modesty 
In a love field 
In a love field 
In a love field 
You yield with your lips still sealed 
In a love field 
Lost in a sea of imaginary women 
Everything you'd want 
from the dawn to the dimming 
Breath comes sharp and heart beats faster 
In a love field 
Cold ground for a pillow 
Under a blanket of stars 
In a love field 
In a love field 
In a love field 
Headlights that startled 
This embrace of hours 
In a love field 
In a crooked house 
Where things can be arranged 
You think you're different from the rest 
But you don't see how you've changed 
Under an archway 
On a road of white linen 
In a love field 
Feel the anxious rhythm of a functional stranger 
In a love field 
In a love field 
In a love field 
She's so tense but it's never mentioned 
In a love field",Love Field [Live]
Elvis Costello,"Somewhere in the distance
I can hear who shot Sam
This is my conviction that I am an innocent man
Oh, you say, I'm unkind, I'm being as nice as I can

Boys everywhere fumbling with the catches
I struck lucky with motel matches
Falling for you without a second look
Falling out of your open pocket book
Giving you away like motel matches

I wake with the siren in an emergency
Though your mind is full of love
In your eyes there is a vacancy
And you know what I do
When the light outside changes from red to blue

Boys everywhere fumbling with the catches
I struck lucky with motel matches
Falling for you without a second look
Falling out of your open pocket book
Giving you away like motel matches",Motel Matches [Live]
Elvis Costello,"I know a girl got my mind in a mess
I never heard her say goodnight and God bless

And when we're alone we never quarrel
I'm miles away now here's the moral
She's not the only flame in town

She's not the only flame in town
She's got to stop thinking that I'm
Carrying this torch around

He struck a match and it lit up her face
We should have struck a match girl
To burn down the whole place
Now you're not the only flame in town

But you blew hot and cold, turned my heart to a cinder
And with each passing day
You'd be less tender and more tinder

She's not the only flame in town
She's got to stop thinking that I'm
Carrying this torch around

Elvis Costello,"Out of the aeroplane stepped
Chamberlain with a condemned man's stare
But we all cheered wildly, a photograph was taken
As he waved a piece of paper in the air

Now, the disco machine lives in Munich
And we are all friends
And I slip on my Italian dancing shoes
As the evening descends

And the bells take their toll
Once again in a victory chime
And we can thank God that we've finally got
Peace in our time

There's a man going round taking names no
Matter who you claim to be
As innocent as babies, a mad dog with rabies
You're still a part of some conspiracy

Meanwhile there's a light over the ocean
Burning brighter than the sun
And a man sits alone in a bar and says
""Oh God, what have we done?""

And the bells take their toll
Once again in a victory chime
And we can thank God that we've finally got
Peace in our time

They're lighting a bonfire
Upon every hilltop in the land
Just another tiny island invaded
When he's got the whole world in his hands

And the heavyweight champion fights
In the international propaganda star wars
There's already one spaceman in the White House
What do you want another one for?

And the bells take their toll
Once again in a victory chime
And we can thank God that we've finally got
Peace in our time",Peace in Our Time [Demo Version]
Elvis Costello,"Picture a hotel room
Clothes scattered across the floor
Covers pulled back from the pillow
A sign hung on the door
Two lovers locked up tight
Through the endless days and nights
Hiding something they can't show
Something no-one must know

[Chorus]
There's a room without a number
While the sign outside says there's
No vacancy as you take your key
They smile at you so understandingly

She cried out in the night
Woke the porter from his sleep
He grinned slyly to himself
As he went to fetch his keys
Look what love has brought them to
This terrible nightmare
His or hers he could not tell
As they were sleeping there

[Chorus]

And I wish he could be
The man he was before he was me

A girl arrived at first light
And inquired if they'd been seen
And why the numbers ran from twelve
Missing out thirteen
And they said oh my darling
Put it down to superstition
Try to avoid a scandal
And don't arouse suspicion
They re-arranged the furniture
They even papered over the door

There's a room without a number
While the sign outside says there's
No vacancy as you take your key
They smile just so so you know

[Chorus]",Room With No Number
Elvis Costello,"You like coffee and you like tea
Much more than you like me
And everybody says watch out yeah
For the sour milk-cow blues
You like your coffee just a little too sweet
Without your sugar life is incomplete
And everybody says watch out yeah
For the sour milk-cow blues

I think about you everyday
Something about you is not the same
Something about the things you say
Sounds like a different woman with a different name
Sour milk-cow blues

You wear a different size and style of shoe
I think that someone must be poisoning you
To replace you with a living double
Get out of my life right now and save them all of the trouble
They changed your complexion and your personality
Somebody's putting ideas in your head
They took the girl of my dreams and left you here instead
Sour milk-cow blues

You take your place in this parade of pleas
You dial a number and they offer relief
All alone with just your own device
They give you something and it isn't advice
To break the hearts of a million listeners
Start out as lovers and you end up as prisoners
Somebody's suffering from the things that you do
Somebody's suffering but you're glad it isn't you
Put your fingertips up to the screen
Repeat after me, wake at the count of three
Now I don't know which is worse

Before someone gets suspicious or someone gets discovered
You can live forever in a split second of fame

While a crocodile makes good shoes and a dog may change his coat
I can't change what's written on your face tonight and i quote

Oh i wish you could see
Quite how much you could mean to me
You worthless thing
If you were ten feet taller and almost handsome
I might pay this king's ransom
You worthless thing

They commit blue murder along union avenue
Then they sell you souvenir matches
Nightclubs full of grave robbers from memphis, Tennessee
And Las Vegas body snatchers
And he's carrying a warning can't you see how his eyes glint
Keep your bloody hands off my life your affectionate fingerprint

[Chorus]

All the cars and pills and girls who tore his shirt to tatters
Do you know how tall he was ''cause that is all that really matters?
Do you know his mother's last name do you think that he's divine?
You've seen the film you've read the book
You're drinking vintage elvis presley wine

Bored out of your tiny mind while life is twice as large
They'll cut her down to size on television
She's available and beautiful, but with more time to devote
They're going to take this cable now and stick it down your throat
So this is an obituary which should be right and fitting
For every clockwork cat and conceivable kitten

Elvis Costello,"Well, I had a little feeling to have a big night
And woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the who am I and where is she and what did I do
But worst of all, I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
I didn't even touch the light switch so I knew I'd never see
The haggard face that would be staring back at me

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Well, I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the who am I and who is she and what did I do

Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly

Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm
You have this expression dear no words could take its place
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face

I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls
If you'll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss
If you don't know what is wrong with me
Then you don't know what you've missed

We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""

My old love lines were all worn out on you
And the world walked 'round at my mouth
They lit me up and they snuffed me out

And I was everybody's boy
But soon that thrill just fades
To be the love of one true heart
Or the Jack of all parades

You won't know who to thank
You won't know who to blame
It's just a part of the murdering game
'Cause down in the fleshpots

Where they pay you in pounds
They're laughing like drains
And baying like bloodhounds
For the Jack of all parades
The Jack of all parades

Once I knew a girl that looked so much like Judy Garland
That people would stop and give her money
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby
Not the Jack, the Jack of all parades

Oh the Jack, the Jack of all parades
Oh the Jack, of all parades

Now the way that I feel is no longer news
You know my love and how to refuse it
'Cause you know where the door is
And how to use it, oh you know you do

But from my checkered past to this shattered terrace
Where you can't keep your mind off the 'Crimes of Paris'
And you can't keep your peace and try to forget it
And I can't forgive you for things you haven't done yet

Oh, I was anybody's boy
But soon that thrill just fades

Elvis Costello,"Outside in New Orleans the heat was almost frightening
But my hotel room as usual was freezing and unkind
On TV they prosecute anyone who's exciting
So I put on my overcoat and went down to find

In Revlon and crimpelene they captured my heart
To the strain of a piano and a cocktail murderess
She was singing that ""It's Too Late"", I agreed with that part
For two English girls who had changed their address

Oh it seems we've been crying for years and for years
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears
Just American without tears

One had been a beauty queen and the other was her friend
They had known rogues and rascals and showbiz impresarios
While the boys were licking Hitler they had something to defend
From men armed with chewing gum and fine nylon hose
By a bicycle factory as they sounded the siren
And returned into the dance hall she knew he was the one
Though he wasn't tall or handsome she laughed when he told her
""I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham and this is Little John""

Oh it seems we've been crying for years and for years
Now I don't speak any English, just American without tears
Just American without tears

At a dock in Southampton full of tearful goodbyes
Newsreel commentators said ""Cheerio, G.I. brides""
Soon they'll be finding the cold facts and lies
New words for suspenders and young girls backsides

Now I'm in America and running from you
Like my grandfather before me walked the streets of New York
And I think of all the women I pretend mean more than you
When I open my mouth and I can't seem to talk

Oh it seems we've been crying for years and for years
Now I don't speak any English just American without tears
Just American without tears
Oh it seems we've been crying for years and for years
Now I don't speak any English just American without tears
Just American without tears",American Without Tears
Elvis Costello,"Oh well I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
Had to face of who am I, where is she, what did I do
Worst of all I had to face the big light

'Cause the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration, well

With the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
I didn't even touch the light switch so I knew I'd never see
The haggard face that would be staring back at me

'Cause the big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
But it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
I had to face the who am I, who is she, what did I do
First of all I had to face the big light

The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

Oh well it's fine to go out and have a big night
But sooner or later you're got to face the big light",The Big Light
Elvis Costello,"Baby can you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be mad

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
With other times it seems that all I have to do is worry
And then I know you're bound to see my other side

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

If I get mad at you I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you
Oh whoa whoa, don't you know I'm human
I've got my faults just like any one
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

I ain't telling you jealous

Elvis Costello,"Enter Madam X painted in a shocking pink spangled dress
Her teeth are perfect but her mouth is loose
Rubbing their hands together she persuades them that it's better to confess
Which unpleasant fate they'd like to choose

Every step might be your last
Money signs are in your eyes sucker
You've been taken in this time
You might just get out alive if you're lucky
All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch
Are looking in on you
And they're hungry

He stood five feet tall in his elevator shoes and stovepipe hat
He was known by several different names
Prompted by Madam X he answered all their questions
And then after that he said I'm sick and tired of stupid games

Every step might be your last
Money signs are in your eyes sucker
You've been taken in this time
You might just get out alive if you're lucky
All the vultures tuning in to Glitter Gulch
Are looking in on you
And they're hungry

We've got prizes if you can afford
Some small humiliation before you get your reward
And I'd rather be an outlaw than an in-law to you
And to live my life in miserable poverty
Than to have to grovel to have some dream home hovel
So watch me while I get away with prime time robbery

As he enters Madam X he things of red raged faces and the sweet greenbacks
He climbed upon his honey and he covered her with money
As they do their victory dance
He thinks I hope they choke upon their laughter tracks
They can all go straight to hell while we howl down the whole hotel",Glitter Gulch
Elvis Costello,"I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair
I hate these strip lights they're not so undoing as your stare
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I want to do is tear
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here

Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly

Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm
You have this expression dear no words could take its place
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face

Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly

I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dance halls
If you'll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss
If you don't know what is wrong with me
Then you don't know what you've missed

Were you arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight
When the bell rang out and the air around turned blue from fright
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""

Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly,
I'll wear proudly, I'll wear it proudly",I'll Wear It Proudly
Elvis Costello,"When we first met I didn't know what to do
My old love lines were all worn out on you
And the world walked 'round my mouth
They lit me up and they snuffed me out

And I was everybody's boy
But soon that thrill just fades
To be the love of one true heart
Or the jack of all parades

You won't know who to thank
You won't know who to blame
It's just a part of the murdering game
'Cause down in the fleshpots
Where they pay you in pounds
They're laughing like drains
And baying like bloodhounds
For the jack of all parades
For the jack of all parades

Once I knew a girl
That looked so much like Judy Garland
That people would stop and give her money
And everybody was Frankie, Jimmy or Bobby
Not the jack, not the jack of all parades,
Oh the jack, the jack of all parades,
Oh the jack, of all parades.

Well the way that I feel is no longer news
You know my love and how to refuse it
'Cause you know where the door is
And how to use it
Oh you know you do

From my checkered past
To this shattered terrace
Where you can't keep your mind off
The crimes of Paris
And you can't keep your peace
Try to forget it
And I can't forgive you
For things you haven't done yet

I was anybody's boy
But soon that thrill just fades
To be the love of one true heart

Elvis Costello,"She had her mind made up just like her face
She painted in the lines and shadows
She shaded color in that would express
The lonely mood that follows
Love, short and painful and tidy lies in self-defense
She just told a thing or two to the King of Confidence

You said that he could tell her anything
She even held him when he was crying
And made her feel she was the only one
You knew that he was lying when he said he was lying

Love is short and painful, that she finally made sense
Of the love he had for the one and only King of Confidence

It's hard enough to be your lover, let alone your confidant
You say you know what I need but you don't know who I want
It's just another tawdry morning now
Another tarnished farewell
Your body's tired and complaining now
But you're too tore down to tell

Love is short and painful, all you kind ladies and gents
I spent years in a couple of days as the King of Confidence

Elvis Costello,"In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown
In the silver paper of the wrapper
There's a dapper little man
And he wears a wax mustache
That he twists with nicotine fingers
As he drops his cigarette ash
And someone comes and sweeps it up
And then he doffs his cap
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom
And they're shutting someone's trap
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces

And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces

It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope
There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,
The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize

So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces

You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable
To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible

Well you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces",Little Palaces
Elvis Costello,"This is the place where I made my best mistakes
This is the place even angels don't understand
I've seen the disappointment in her face
And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand

She sits alone apart from the crowd
In a white dress she wears like a question mark
Friends speak of her fondly
Enemies just think out loud

You think you're man enough to please her
And you're fool enough to start
But you're not going to do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

Now the cabaret is frozen and the laughter comes in cans
And the lonely hearts club clientele don't know what to do with their hands
You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows
That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes

And you're not going to do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

So you mix your drinks and words
You make bad jokes you make bad time
The floors are there to walk over
The walls are there to climb

You swear you'll never go back again once you're inside
You're never the bridegroom, she's always the bride
And you're not going to do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger
Well you try to love her but she's so contrary
Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary
So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel

Well I thought that he was asking me to dance
In my holy coat and hat and him in his red bonnet
We'd have made a lovely couple but we never had the chance

And now you say that you've got to go
Well if you must you must
I suppose that you need the sleep of the just

Well it was a powerful day and there were black crows in the road
And I kept my strong opinions to my chest
I suppose I should have told them that I was on fire for you
When the bus burst into flames outside some place, 'The Poet's Rest'

And now you say that you've got to go
Well if you must you must
I suppose that you need the sleep of the just

A girl woke up in a naked light and said ""Oh no not again""
He even looked like her brother in the army but she never mentions him
He'll be tucked up in his bed tonight with his dirty pictures girl
Saying, 'You're some mother's daughter you know or is it
Immaterial girl?'

Now she's pinned up upon the barracks wall in her home town
All the soldiers taking turns with their attentions
And as they speculate what she'd look like beneath that thin nightgown
His family pride was rising up as he cast his eyes down

Will you look at this disgrace

If we were chrome, we would be rusty
If we were thirst, we would be quenched

You need a brand new wrench

And cover you with kisses
Once I was the jewel of your heart
Now I'm only semi-precious
But if I seem so preoccupied
It's just my alibi--I'm all broken up inside
Even the words of love seem cruel and crass
When you're tough and transparent as armored glass
I prepared a bed for you
Then I sprayed perfume
Upon the wilted roses
That I'd scattered 'round the room
You came in gentle as a lamb
And turned into a terror
And you left your love and other threats
In the steam fading on my bathroom mirror

Outside there was a public execution
Inside he died a thousand deaths

And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
And they put him in a suit of lights

In the perforated first editions
Where they advocate the hangman's noose
Then tell the sorry tale of the spent Princess
Her uncouth escort looking down her dress

Anyway they say that she wears the trousers
And learnt everything that she does
And doesn't know if she should tell him yes
Or let him go

And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground

Well it's a dog's life in a rope leash or a diamond collar
It's enough to make you think right now
But you don't bother
For goodness sake as you cry and shake
Let's keep you face down in the dirt where you belong
And think of all the pleasure that it brings
Though you know that it's wrong

And there's still life in your body
But most of it's leaving
Can't you give us all a break
Can't you stop breathing

And I thought I heard ""The Working Man's Blues""
I went to work that night and wasted my breath
Outside they're painting tar on somebody
It's the closest to a work of art that they will ever be

Two men in evening hats
Telling tales of the underground and
Fishing for Reds
Policemen armed with Uzis
Stand guard but they don't speak
Ain't seen no Michaeangelo
He'll be here next week.

With the crystal heels went chaperoned by her brother

Take pictures of each other
Of the policemen in the fountains
And the sickle and the hammer

With his walking cane and camera

She looked like someone's girlfriend
She looked like a dream
She looked as unlikely
As the people's limousine.

Come and sit by me, girl, before I breathe the breath out of you
Hush your mouth and cover your eyes for I'll tell your father of you
He paid to have you painted in the company of angels
Only to find you flirting anew with Chico Marx and perverted Engels

The patron saint of television smiles down from the shelf
Romulus can't criticize but he can't bless himself
He has a tin of pea-green paint and a big roll of black tape
To vandalize these obscenities then make his escape

Elvis Costello,"Big nothing. 
He stood in the road outside of town 
With a broken clockwork toy in his hand. 
A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm 
A broken lifeline. 
Big nothing. 
The mechanical amusement sputtered to life in his fist. 
As he clenched, it whirred and died again. 
It was a cowboy who drew his gun, 
But the pistol was welded to the holster 
By age and careless children, 
So it struggled and strained 
And it unwound its own spring. 
Big nothing. 
He didn't need tattoos to show where he'd been 
And who he'd loved. 
It was the same thing that men had cried for; 
That women had dyed their hair for. 
The cellophane illusion of a starry sky 
Stretched over an open sore. 
Big nothing. 
He thought about his lost daughter 
The way her eyes would alight at the greedy circus barker's blackmail song 
How he wanted to smash her skull in when she parroted back, 
'Tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little dolly.' 
Big nothing. 
Big nothing. 
The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. 
There was too much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. 
She took him to bed like an adopted dog. 
Big nothing. 
She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell himself 
The resemblance were pure and coincidental. 
He unleashed his grip on the toy and all it meant to him, 
And it wound down forever. 
Big nothing. 
He woke up in a sweat, the next day. 
With her smile still painted on his mouth 
He walked out of a town called Big Nothing.

And I won't get any older, now that angels want to wear my red shoes

Our love got fractured in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend?
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

Oh, I know that she's disgusted (oh, why's that?)
Because she's feeling so abused (oh, that's too bad)
She gets tired of the lust (oh, I'm so sad)
But it's so hard to refuse
Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

Oh, oh I said, ""I'm so happy I could die""
She said, ""Drop dead,"" then left with another guy

The glib replies the same defeats
Keep your finger on important issues
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues
I'm just the oily slick
On the windup world of the nervous tick
In a very fashionable hovel

I hang around dying to be tortured
You'll never be alone in the bone orchard
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel

So in this almost empty gin palace
Through a two-way looking glass
You see your Alice

You know she has no sense
For all your jealousy
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly

Charged with insults and flattery
Her body moves with malice
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous

And now you find you fit this identikit completely
You say you have no secrets
And then leave discreetly

I might make it California's fault
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault
Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef
I come to you beyond belief

My hands were clammy and cunning
She's been suitably stunning
But I know there's not a hope in Hades
All the laddies cat call and wolf whistle
So called gentlemen and ladies
Dog fight like rose and thistle

I'm going to get a lot of grief
Once this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief

And it's in the papers, it's in the charts

With all the style and finesse of the purchase of armaments
Compassion went out of fashion

Sweat it out for thirty seconds on home improvements

And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear

""Isn't that very fortunate for you""

A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals
The words of love in whispers
And the acts of love in screams

The ugly little scenes you get the needle and no thread
They stitched you up this time
They say you`ll do
They bitch about your pretty face, turning ugly on you

The butcher the baker and the bassline maker
Sayin' you can leave her, I can take her
You spend your whole life like a minute or two later
One day its going to end sooner than greater

What would the loved ones say
He`ll be remembered young and pretty
What would the loved ones say
Now he`s a hit in every city
Now there`s a name we'll never forget
There`s one born every minute or two
Don't pin a medal on me yet
They might be waiting for you

Oh what would the loved ones say

Oh what would the loved ones say

Beyond caution where lovers walk
Your love walks where three's a crowd
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Lovers walk, lovers scramble
Beyond caution where the lovers walk
Lovers step, shuffle and gamble
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Lovers trip, lovers stumble
Lovers dip, lovers fumble
Lovers lip where love has crumbled
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lovers leap
Lovers late, lovers wait
Making promises that they can't keep
Lovers link up arm and arm
Lovers slink up, lovers charm
Lovers drink up and come to harm
Beyond caution where lovers walk

Love is gone and it's no one's fault
Love has stopped here, lovers halt
Lovers don't walk, lovers run
Will you look what love has done
Will you look what love has done

Elvis Costello,"Now there's newsprint all over your face, well
Maybe that's why I can read you like a book
Just when I thought I was getting my tasty bite
I go and lose my appetite
Look at the men that you'd call uncle
They'd like to sink their teeth into you
For the pride and the pleasure and the privilege of having you
If I say you're the one, do you think that I'm serious?
You get that kind of talk from older men
If I say I love you then I must be delirious
So why are you trying to put my temperature up again?
Look at the men that you'd call uncle
Having a heart attack 'round your ankles
When you wake up with x-rated eyes
When you wake up still shaking
How could I apologize as your check your effects
And you check your reflection?
I'm so affected in the face of your affection
Look at the men that you'd call uncle
Having a heart-attack 'round your ankles
I could swear, I could promise that I'll always be true to you
But we may not live to be so old
I could even say I'm going to do something new to you
Now the girls I see just leave me cold

Elvis Costello,"So this is where he came to hide
When he ran from you
In a private detective`s overcoat
And dirty dead man`s shoes

The pretty things of Knightsbridge
Lying for a minister of state
Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor`s gate

`Cause the high heel he used to be has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time

There`s a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumour
Days of dutch courage
Just three French letters and a German sense of humour

He`s got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought

Somebody`s creeping in the kitchen
There`s a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife`s edge
Who`s up late polishing the blade

Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time
Will you still love
A man out of time
Will you still love
A man out of time",Man Out of Time
Elvis Costello,"Somewhere in the distance I can hear ""who shot Sam?""
This is my conviction, that I am an innocent man
Though you say I'm unkind
I'm being as nice as I can

Boys everywhere, fumbling with the catches
I struck lucky with motel matches
Falling for you without a second look
Falling out of your open pocketbook
Giving you away like motel matches

I wake with the siren in an emergency
Though your mind is full of love
In your eyes there is a vacancy
And you know what I'll do
When the light outside changes from red to blue

Boys everywhere, fumbling with the catches
I struck lucky with motel matches

Why don't you tell me about the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me
'Cause I've tried and I've tried, and I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

Well, I remember when the lights went out
And I was tryin' to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew, and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing, but we didn't know how to do it

Why don't you tell me about the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me
'Cause I've tried and I've tried, and I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

Well, I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Tryin' to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But what's the use of looking when you don't know what they mean?

Why don't you tell me about the mystery dance

If I had any sense now I wouldn't want it back again

New Amsterdam it's become much too much
Till I have the possession of everything she touches
Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches
Till I speak double dutch to a real double duchess

Down on the mainspring, listen to the tick tock
Clock all the faces that move in on your block
Twice shy and dog tired because you've been bitten
Everything you say now sounds like it was ghost-written

New Amsterdam it's become much too much
Till I have the possession of everything she touches
Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches
Till I speak double dutch to a real double duchess

Back in London they'll take you to heart after a little while
Though I look right at home I still feel like an exile

Somehow I found myself down at the dockside
Thinking about the old days of Liverpool and Rotherhithe
The transparent people who live on the other side
Living a life that is almost like suicide

Till I have the possession of everything she touches
Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches
Till I speak double dutch to a real double duchess",New Amsterdam
Elvis Costello,"Bad lovers face to face in the morning
Shy apologies and polite regrets
Slow dances that left no warning of
Outraged glances and indiscreet yawning
Good manners and bad breath get you nowhere

Even presidents have newspaper lovers
Ministers go crawling under covers
She's no angel
He's no saint
They're all covered up with white washed grease paint
And you say

The teacher never told you anything but white lies
But you never see the lies
And you believe
Oh you know you have been captured
You feel so civilized
And you look so pretty in your new lace sleeves

The salty lips of the socialite sisters
With their continental fingers that have
Never seen working blisters
Oh I know they've got their problems
I wish I was one of them
They say daddy's coming home soon
With his sergeant stripes and his empire mug and spoon

No more fast buck
And when are they gonna learn their lesson
But when are they gonna stop all of these victory processions
And you say

The teacher never told you anything but white lies
But you never see the lies
And you believe
But you know you have been captured
You feel so civilized

Elvis Costello,"They say you're nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high, but
I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
They'd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look me over
Seen 'em leaving when the party's over

They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything but time
Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance

Oh, you'll never be the guilty party girl
Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
Maybe I'll never get over the change in style, but
I don't want to lock you up and say you're mine
Don't want to lose you or say goodbye
I'm the guilty party and I want my slice
But I know you've got me and I'm in a grip-like vise

But you can't put them back together, you can't put them back together

What would you say, what would you do?
Children and animals two-by-two
Give me the needle, give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap

Four and twenty crowbars, jemmy your desire
Out of the frying pan into the fire
The king is in the counting house, some folk have all the luck
And all we get is pictures of Lord and Lady Muck
They come from lovely people with a hardline in hypocrisy
There are ashtrays of emotion for the fag ends of the aristocracy

Give me the needle, give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap

Give me the needle, give me the rope

You think your country needs you but you know it never will
So pack up your troubles in a stolen handbag
Don't dilly-dally boys, rally round the flag
Give us your daily bread in individual slices
And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis

I would be happier with amnesia

And spilled into the mezzanine of the crushed capsule hotel
Between the Disney abattoir and the chemical refinery
I knew I was in trouble but I thought I was in hell
So you look around the tiny room and you wonder where the hell you are
While the K.K.K. convention are all stranded in the bar
They wear hoods and carry shotguns in the main streets of Montgomery
But they're helpless here as babies 'cause they're only here on holiday

And feasted them on fish and chips from a newspaper facsimile
Now dead Italian tourist bodies litter up the Broadway
Some people can't be told, you know they have to learn the hard way

Holidays are dirt-cheap in the Costa del Malvinas
In the Hotel Argentina they can hardly tell between us
For Teresa is a waitress, though she's now known as Juanita
In a tango bar in Stanley or in Puerto Margarita
She's the sweetest and the sauciest
The loveliest and naughtiest
She's Miss Buenos Aires in a world of lacy lingerie

For all we know and all we care they might as well be Martians
They say gold paint on the palace gates comes from the teeth of pensioners
They're so tired of shooting protest singers
That they hardly mention us
While fountains fill with second-hand perfume and sodden trading stamps
They'll hang the bullies and the louts that dampen down the day

""Take me to the Folies Bergères, and please don't spare the hearses""
For he always had a dream of that revolver in your purse
How you loved him 'till you hated him and made him cry for mercy
He said ""don't ever mention my name there or talk of all the nights you cried
We've always been like worlds apart, now you're seeing two nightmares collide""

Her eyes were like absinthe

She wiped him off she wiped him out and then
She made him confess

Grinds, as he repeats ""Bangkok""

She might as well be on the moon
He`s away on a business trip, in Dusseldorf, but she`s becoming immune
To the lack of glamor and danger in a West-German city today
The nearest she comes to the ""Dynasty"" he promised her
Is a Chinese takeaway

[Chorus]

Though he only taught her three little words, it
Doesn't matter if they`re dirty or clean
He can only control what they look like
He can never possess what they mean
Now he wants to whisper in her ear
All the shrinking nothingness
But something always comes between them,
I wonder if you can guess

Elvis Costello,"Yesterday's coal train came to rest in the bitter cutting
And as the signals took an age to change it was easy pickings
So you go to the movies where they smash it up
You want to feel your heart pumping it makes you feel good
All through the karaoke girls were squealing the hits
As another Mercedes-Benz gets blown to bits
While all the time in the Camptown Theatres of Piccadilly
They're going to throw a black-face minstrel show for the barefoot children
That they're always selling
They'll say ""It's quaint"" as the guilty ones faint
And claim they ain't underneath this paint
We interrupt these liberal saints with their whips and watermelon

Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery
It's like another world, or it had better be

So we return to whitewashed pout of his committed lips
Since he was declared the long lost fountain of youth 
That drips and drips and drips
They'll be sending him round from door to door,
To sell you back what's already yours
""So many good deeds, so little time""
Say the advertising agency swine
When man has destroyed what he thinks he owns
I hope no living thing cries over his bones
If you don't believe that I'm going for good
You can count the days I'm gone and chop up the chairs for firewood

Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery
It's like another world, or it had better be",Coal-Train Robberies
Elvis Costello,"Hush my little one don`t cry so
You know your Daddy`s bound to go
They took his pride
They took his voice
Don`t upset him now, don`t make a noise
They said ""You`re lucky son you've still got a choice""
Last boat leaving

Don`t waste your tears
It`s not as if I`m in chains
I don`t want to go now, it would be better for
You, too, if I don`t look back when we sail

Hush my dear, while I whisper it in your ear
We`re not going to sail tonight
We`re going to disappear
And it feels like a punishment, but I don`t know what for
Take care of your mother, son, it`s you that she adores
`Cos no matter how long we sail we`ll never reach the shore
Last boat leaving

So dry your tears
It`s not as if I`m in chains
When you go to school, son, you`ll read my story in history books
Only they won`t mention my name

So hush now, my darling, my sweet little one
I hope that you never have to do what I`ve done
Do you know what I've done?
Why I`m going away? On the last boat leaving this stinking town
It`s the last boat leaving, it`s the last boat leaving

You've had my innocence, you've had my heartbreak
You've taken the place where I once belonged
Now what more can you take?",Last Boat Leaving
Elvis Costello,"Bentley said to Craig ""Let him have it Chris""
They still don`t know today just what he meant by this
Craig fired the pistol, but was too young to swing
So the police took Bentley and the very next thing
Let him dangle
Let him dangle

Bentley had surrendered, he was under arrest,
When he gave Chris Craig that fatal request
Craig shot Sidney Miles, he took Bentley`s word
The prosecution claimed as they charged them with murder
Let him dangle
Let him dangle

They say Derek Bentley was easily led
Well what`s that to the woman that Sidney Miles wed
Though guilty was the verdict, and Craig had shot him dead
The gallows were for Bentley and still she never said
Let him dangle
Let him dangle

Well it`s hard to imagine it`s the times that have changed
When there`s a murder in the kitchen that is brutal and strange
If killing anybody is a terrible crime
Why does this bloodthirsty chorus come round from time to time
Let him dangle

Not many people thought that Bentley would hang
But the word never came, the phone never rang
Outside Wandsworth Prison there was horror and hate
As the hangman shook Bentley`s hand to calculate his weight
Let him dangle

From a welfare state to society murder
Bring ""back the noose"" is always heard
Whenever those swine are under attack
But it won`t make you even
It won`t bring him back

Let him dangle
Let him dangle (String him up)",Let Him Dangle
Elvis Costello,"All the children testified that Miss Macbeth
Wore a fishbone slide in her cobweb tresses
Her eyes were black like first foot coal, clutched as white as chalk-dust
Her fingers sweated India-ink and poison-pen letters
There is a hungry hanging tree, just below your bedroom window
You can hear her take a broom to beat out a tattoo on the ceiling
Her bloodless face ran red inside but was she
Really evil, was she only pantomime

Now the chalk on the wall says that somebody
Saves, that somebody`s face has just been washed off the pavement
Into a puzzle where petrol will be poisoned by rain
Miss Macbeth saw her reflection
As confetti bled it`s colors down the drain

[Chorus:]
And everyday she lives out another love song
It`s a tearful lament of somebody done wrong
Well how can you miss what you`ve never possessed?
Miss Macbeth

Well we all should have known when the children paraded
They portrayed her in their fairy tales, sprinkling deadly Nightshade
And as they tormented her she rose to the bait
Even a scapegoat must have someone to hate

And everyday she lives out another love song
""You`re up there enjoying yourself, and I know it`s wrong""

Well how can you miss what you've never possessed
Miss Macbeth

Sometimes people are just what they appear to be
With no redemption at all
We try to walk upright when we can`t even crawl

Miss Macbeth has a gollywog she chucks under
The chin and she whispers to it tenderly Then sticks it on a pin
And it might be coincidence, but a boy down
The lane, that she said ""went white as he could do,"" then doubled over in pain

[Chorus]",Miss MacBeth
Elvis Costello,"She looked like she learned to dance from a series of still pictures
She's madly excited now, she throws her hands up like a tulip

She looks like an illustration of a cocktail party
Where cartoon bubbles burst in the air,
Champagne rolls off her tongue like a second language
And it should have been her biggest night
The satellite looks down on her as she begins to cry

[Chorus:]
All over the world at the very same time people sharing the same sorrow
As the satellite looks down her darkest hour is somebody's bright tomorrow

He pulled on a cigarette, in the crook of his first finger
Felt the static electric charge of her perfect hour-glass figure
As he undressed her with his eyes her weakness was his talent
How could she know as she stepped through the lights, that her dress would become
Transparent
And with his face pressed to the screen,
He muttered words he'd never dare to say if she could see him

All over the world at the very same time
People sharing the same cheap sensation the
Thrill of watching somebody watching those
Forbidden things we never mention

[Chorus]

The satellite looks down right now and forever
What it has pulled apart let no man tether his own body to his dream,
His dream to someone else
Oh no, oh no.

She went back to a pitiful compromise, he'd go back to his family
But for the matter of a thousand miles that separated them entirely
In the hot unloving spotlight, with secrets it arouses
Now they both know what it's like inside a pornographer's trousers
And in a funny way it's anonymous, the satellite
It blesses us and makes these dreams come
True...all over the world

If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me
If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence

But if you leave me then I'm broken
And If I'm broken then only death remains",Broken
Elvis Costello,"I saw a girl who'd found her consolation
She said ""One day my Prince of Peace will come""
Above her head a portrait of her father
The wilted favor that he gave her still fastened to the frame
""They've got his bones and everything he owns
I've got his name""

Well you can laugh at this sentimental story
But in time you'll have to make amends
The sudden chill where lovers doubt their immortality
As the clouds cover the sky the evening ends
Describing a picture of eyes finally closing
As you sometimes glimpse terrible faces in the fire
We'll I'm the lucky goon
Who composed this tune
From birds arranged on the high wire

Who on earth is tapping at the window?
Does that face still linger at the pane?
I saw you shiver though the room was like a furnace
A shadow of regret across a young mother's face
So toll the bell or rock the cradle
Please don't let me fear anything I cannot explain
I can't believe, I'll never believe in anything again",Couldn't Call It Unexpected No. 4
Elvis Costello,"Georgie grew to hate her name
It sounded like a tiny man
And the one she had said ""I can't see you, but I'll call you
Whenever I can""
Sometimes the phone would ring, when she was half-asleep
A voice would drag her down with its suggestions
Though she often felt cheated, she never felt cheap

[Chorus:]
Well heaven knows what fills the heart and makes you feel so alive
It's impossible to tear apart
Georgie and her rival
It was half-past February
And he hadn't called since New Year's Day
Maybe he'd found another woman to say those words no chapel girl should say
Her mother would phone and always keep talking
She'd try to be polite, making faces
But somewhere in the back of her mind, her rival was stalking

[Chorus]

Her rival would always wait till the eighth or ninth bell
He'd be desperate anyway and drunk as well
She always liked to hurt him to prove he was prepared
To love her anyway that she wanted
So she could tell which she preferred
He sat up with his address book trying to think what mood he's in
His finger traced past Georgie's name to someone who needed less
Persuading
He didn't hear through her disguise he didn't leave her in a rush
Just like the promise that he left on her machine
That almost made her blush
The radio plays a lover's symphony
""The number you have dialed has been re-directed""
Now she puts him on the speaker-phone
Whenever she has company

[Chorus]",Georgie and Her Rival
Elvis Costello,"He selects the plainest face form a spiteful row of girls
Elegant insulted women, a flaw of cultured pearls
He drops a name or two, she fails to catch
At last he`s met his match
Unspoiled and unaffected, he wants her so much

She puts up half-hearted resistance, like she was taught to do
She`s heard some of those small town playboys but this is something new
His promise seems dangerous, she`d like to believe
He says ""You`d better leave""
""You`ve only got yourself to blame, shame, or deceive""

The waiting lines are long
They never get too far
Everyone wearing that medal with pride
Harpies Bizarre

I looked on but hesitated
I failed to interrupt
You`re so hard to tell the truth to
So easy to corrupt
I`ll memorize your face
Your tragic smile
The hurt look in your eyes
As you betrayed yourself to the part of him that dies

The waiting lines are long
They never get too far
They`re shining up their shoes to kick a falling star
You think you should be somebody
But you don`t know who you are

Elvis Costello,"I was hell-bent on destroying my powers of concentration
While you were living like a saint
And all the time the very one you trusted was washing off
Somebody else's paint

Now you've got yourself a brand new occupation
Every fleeting thought is a pearl
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway
Of the funniest fucker in the world

They're here to help you
Satisfy your desire
There's a bright future for all you professional liars

[Chorus]
Now you know how to be dumb
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?
Don't you know how to be dumb?
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes

They emptied out all the asylums, they emptied out all the jails
The ""new bruise"" was the name of a dance craze
By ""Jesus cross and the cruel nails""
Followed up by ""torturing little beaver""
With their contraption of barbed wire
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require
They'll be howling by midnight, they'll be drooling by dawn
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains
Heads shaven and shorn

[Chorus]

Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully
You always had to dress up your envy in some half-remembered
Philosophy

Now you're masquerading as pale powdered genius
Whose ever bad intention has been purged
You could've walked out any time you wanted but face it you
Didn't have the courage
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of
Twisted dilettante
Funny though people don't usually get so ugly 'til they think
They know what they want
Scratch your own head stupid
Count up to three
Roll over on your back
Repeat after me

Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes?
Don't you know how to be dumb?

Elvis Costello,"Now that you set everybody free
What are you going to do about me?
Don`t want to be treated like some poor grateful clown
I`d rather go back to the sweet underground
Where I can tell by the color of my skin
And I know my neighbor `cos he`s the one, yes he`s the one
Who always turns me in

A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night
Picking up every lost object in sight
Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails
The black market eats up all your failures
Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets
No pool, no pets, no cigarettes
Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes

[Chorus:]
There`s no name, no name for the place 
Or pain we`ll cause you again and again
If you do not co-operate with the invasion hit parade

The liberation forces make movies of their own
Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned
Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorized
Incidentally the revolution will be televised
With one head for business and another for good looks
Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons and their butcher`s hooks

[Chorus:]

They`re hunting us down here with Liberty`s light
A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty
Pursued by a T.V. crew and coming after them
A limousine of singing stars and their brotherhood anthem
The former dictator was impeccably behaved
They`re mopping up all the stubborn ones who just refuse to be saved

[Chorus:]",Invasion Hit Parade
Elvis Costello,"Sweet pear, sweet pear
Those who say they love you would never dare
I`ll watch out for you
I`ll always be there
In the hour of distress you need not fear

In all the world there`s only one true love
And finding it`s hard enough
I bless whatever`s in the sky above
For bringing you to me

But there`s a void without your kiss
I wake on the precipice above the abyss
And though the touch of your lips these fears dismiss
Make no mistake there is an ache I have to live with

Was my grip too lose, my grip too strong
That made you want to run away
And now you`re back where I pretend you belong
I wonder every night and day
How long

I swear this is my prayer
`Til we`re burned and scattered in the atmosphere
Or lost in the world across a crowded room
I am your stupid lover, your wretched groom",Sweet Pear

There`s no joy in the air
I just don`t think you care

Close the door
On doubt forever
And may it nevermore
Make me unsure

Turn the key
And lock away this doubt in me
Keep it in the dark
Not in my heart

Be more tender
Completely surrender
Your love to me
Is sweet and not discrete

Remove this doubt
From my heart little girl
And let me live my life
Knowing you care
Remove this doubt
From my mind little girl
And let me breathe again
Knowing my love is shared

Each time we meet
You make me feel so incomplete
There`s no joy in the air
I just don`t think you care

Trying to make a living out of your downfalling
Trying to make a living out of anything at all
Didn't they teach you anything except how to be cruel
In that charm school

You and I as lovers
Were nothing but a farce
Trying to make a silk purse
Out of a sow's arse
Saying 'why don't you watch me'
Hardly speaking sotto voce

I've got a notion
I've got an angle
Take your dreams and promises
And put them through the mangle
They say it's hell to finance too
And I just want to romance you

I'll be yours eternal

And the noise infernal

I got two eyes that happened by ya,
And when they saw you, they said they knew you were fine.
I got two lips that long to kiss you,
And when they speak, they say they wish you were mine.

Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.
Oh, I got a little heart inside me beating
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time.
You better watch out 'cause of what I say
Cause baby, don't you know that I ain't playing a game?

Hey, sweet baby, oh don't you know that I am yours from head to toe.

For just a shabby doll

But won't show his claws

It's all so calculated
She's got a calculator
She's my soft touch typewriter
And I'm the great dictator

One little Hitler does the other one's will

You flick a switch and the world goes off
Nobody jumps as you expect
I would have thought you would have had enough by now

You call selective dating
For some effective mating
I thought I'd let you down, dear
But you were just deflating

I knew right from the start
We'd end up hating
Pictures of the merchandise
Plastered on the wall
We can look so long as we don't have to talk at all

You say you'll never know him
He's an unnatural man
He doesn't want your pleasure
He wants as no one can
He wants to know the names of
All those he's better than

Two little Hitlers will fight it out until
One little Hitler does the other one's will
I will return
I will not burn
I will return
I will not burn
I will return
I will not burn",Two Little Hitlers
Elvis Costello,"Lucy Grace can't show her face down in the North End Road 
For in Belgravia 
Rumors have been whispered and suggestions have been made 
Did you sell your friends out when the heat got too intense? 
You say you like the danger but it's only a pretense 
You say you need the money 
When everybody knows you can always fall back on your inheritance 
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms 
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide? 
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss 
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss? 

Who's that sneaking 'round the door? 
You can't come here no more 
Can't you go home again? 
She used to sit alone for hours 
Spend her evenings watering dried flowers 

When her mother came to stay and finally went to bed 
Lucy Grace was in the front room shooting through your head 
She tried to take your breath away and give you something else instead 

Next year she'll serve her function in that Audrey Hepburn hat 
It still won't suit her much but she'll get over that 
She'll be pale and feign indifference as they're handling out the prizes 
Spilling Daddy's pearls of wisdom 
And her ugly sister's tranquillizers 

Why were you so tardy putting up your guard? 
When you hurt so easily and you try so hard 
Did you bruise your arms on those false alarms 
Did you bruise your pride on his smile so wide? 
Only fingertips from forbidden bliss 
Did you bruise your lips in this basement kiss?",Basement Kiss

Cog consults the watch he cups in his hand 
Bejewelled movement measures lost and vanished time 
Pray for the boy who makes his bed in cold earth and quicklime

So stay the hands, arrest the time 
Till I am captured by your touch 
Blessings I don't count 
Small mercies and such 
The flags may lower as we approach the favorite hour 

Now there's a tragic waste of brutal youth 
Strip and polish this unvarnished truth 
The tricky door that gapes beneath the ragged noose 
The crippled verdict begs again for the lamest excuse

Put out my eyes so I may never spy 
Waving branches as they're waving goodbye 
Their vile perfume brings to my mouth a bitter taste 
The murmuring brooks had best speak up, it's a terrible waste

Elvis Costello,"She lives on Pony Street
And they should scatter flowers at her feet
But when they come calling I think it's appalling
They're sober and they're polite
They're deeply respectful when I would expect them
To keep her out all night
That little martinet
Will get her own way yet
If you need instruction in mindless destruction
I'll show you a thing or two
You used to adore me but now my life flashes before me
For you to view

Oh mother, oh mother, sometimes you are so mortifying
From the hole in your leopard skin tights I can tell you've been spying
But your generation confesses before it transgresses
Those Super-8 movies of daddy in your disco dresses

If you're going out tonight
I won't wait up
Reading ""Das Kapital""
Watching ""Home Shopping Club""
While you're flogging a dead horse
All the way down Pony Street
Where you live after a fashion
All the way down Pony Street
The life and the soul of every indiscretion
That lives on, that lives on, that lives on

Daughter, oh daughter, you know I will love you forever
But spare me the white ankle socks with the lace and the leather
For you and your cartoon threat do no good to resist me
For I am the genuine thing but for you it's just history

If you're going out tonight
How can you be sure
Where you lay your pretty head
Mother may have been before
So you're flogging a dead horse
All the way down Pony Street
Where you live after a fashion
All the way down Pony Street

Elvis Costello,"The chains from the bridle and the reins fell from my hands
The engines are idle and the ship sails on dry land
I stood there stupefied, I thought I recognized
Walking down Rocking Horse Road, getting lost

Shot through Vaseline, he picks up the paper from the lawn
And tucks ""The Suburban Assassin"" underneath his arm
He smiles weakly and turns away
I know you`ll never come to harm
Walking down Rocking Horse Road, it`s so peaceful

It`s like a photograph
From the other side of the world
I said ""I want you only""
And then I left you alone
Crying on Rocking Horse Road, or somewhere quite like it

The cemetery gardens, there are names not numbers on the gateposts
And the eyes in the curtain follow you like a smirking ghost
I know I must not look back
`Cause part of me is waiting still

There on Rocking Horse Road for you
In a little dream house made for two
Well you were the one that made your escape
In your stocking feet and your sticky tape

All the way down [repeat to fade]",Rocking Horse Road
Elvis Costello,"[Chorus:]
This is hell, this is hell
I am sorry to tell you
It never gets better or worse
But you get used to it after a spell
For heaven is hell in reverse

The bruiser spun a hula hoop
As all the barmen preen and pout
The neon ""I"" of nightclub flickers on and off
And finally blew out
The irritating jingle
Of the belly-dancing phony Turkish girls
The eerie glare of ultra violet
Perfect dental work

[Chorus]

The failed Don Juan in the big bow-tie
Is very sorry that he spoke
For he`s mislaid his punch line
More than halfway through a very tasteless joke
The Fraulein caught him peeking down her gown
He`s yelling in her ear
And all at once the music stopped
As he was intimately bellowing ""My dear...""

[Chorus]

The shirt you wore with courage
And the violent nylon suit
Reappear upon your back
And undermine the polished line you try to shoot
It`s not the torment of the flames
That finally see your flesh corrupted
It`s the small humiliations that your memory piles up

This is hell, this is hell, this is hell.
""My Favorite Things"" are playing
Again and again
But it`s by Julie Andrews
And not by John Coltrane
Endless balmy breezes and perfect sunsets framed
Vintage wine for breakfast
And naked starlets floating in Champagne
All the passions of your youth
Are tranquillized and tamed
You may think it looks familiar
Though you may know it by another name

This is hell, this is hell.",This Is Hell
Elvis Costello,"Take your tiny feet out of your mother's shoes
Or there is going to be a terrible scene

How wicked we have been
How I've been tempted

[Chorus]
How you tripped at every step
You tripped at every step, you tripped at every step
How you tripped at every step

There's a merry tune that starts in ""I""
And ends in ""You,"" like many famous pop songs do
You would sing along with little tell-tale staggers
While balancing on daggers
Though they were killing you
You looked so deadly

[Chorus]

And I would try to catch you
Anytime you call
Only you drank that potion
And went out of control
There's nothing to stop you
So how can you fall?
Let me take your hand
Put down that frying pan

Darkness would become me underneath the table
As the fury raged around the house
Your despairing tread was angry and unstable
You never suspected
Just as that cartoon mouse
Went undetected

So you tripped at every step
In another world of gin and cigarettes
Those cocktail cabinets put mud in your eye
Maybe that is why you find it hard to see me
And if you don`t believe me
Before you start to cry
""Don't ever leave me""

As you start to lose your grip

Thirteen steps lead down
There's commoners and kings

Paper and glue
And a decent pair of scissors
So tonight I'm drinking to your health
Because I just can't stand myself

On fashion fingernails
Her lovers have her walking 'round
On instruments of torture
And one of them is poisonous
The other is a thief they say
So what one could give to her
The other cannot take away

When nobody knows she puts on secret clothes
And lies in her splendor for a picture opportunity
Cover up that bruise, put on patent leather shoes
Just stop playing that bad mood music

Elvis Costello,"I'm just about glad that I knew you once
And it was more than just a passing acquaintance
I'm just about glad that it was a memory
That doesn't need constant maintenance

There are a few things that I regret
But nothing that I need to forget
For all of the courage that we never had
I'm just about glad

Just about glad we didn't do that thing
Just about glad we didn't have that fling
Just about glad we didn't give it a try
Just about glad, is that a tear in your eye?

And on the few times I rang to propose
There was a man there or so I suppose
The greatest lover that you never had
I'm just about glad

They called time and vodka and lime
In some far flung Canadian club
(Just about glad)
And there I was just waiting to fall
Like a toe just aching to stub
(Just about glad)

Later on I could never accept it
When you finally gave it all to him
(Just about glad)
And you said that my nurse was sweet
But her lamp was just beginning to dim

I'm just about glad
That we never did that thing we were going to do
I'm just about glad I can look you in the eye
But I can't say the same for you

And though the passion still flutters and flickers
It never got into our knickers
For all of the courage that we never had
I'm just about, I'm just about
I'm just about, I'm just about

Just about glad we didn't do that thing
Just about glad we didn't have that fling
Just about glad we didn't give it a try
Just about glad, is that a tear in your eye?

And it's all just a stupid creation
Of my feverish imagination
If I'm the greatest lover that you never had
I'm just about, I'm just about
I'm just about, I'm just about

Just about glad we didn't do that thing
Just about glad we didn't have that fling
Just about glad we didn't give it a try

Is that a tear in your eye?
Is that a tear in your eye?",Just About Glad [Bonaparte Rooms Version]
Elvis Costello,"Shall I wear a buttonhole to jog your memory? 
So you'll recall the promise 
That I swore you made to me when we were younger 
You look sorry for yourself but what about? 
I'm some idea you're not without a doubt 
So you can put away that tongue 
I don't know who I'm trying to kid 
I'll find another name for you 
I'll try to put the blame on you 
For everything we did 
Life shrinks and before you know it 
You have forgotten all the cuts and bruises 
Just be thankful we were only fighting for buttons 
And you know by now who loses 

You're only half awake because you never go to bed 
And when he hears about it 
You know then the both of you's is dead and that's a promise 
You'll be sorry because I won't tell you again 
You'll stick like that one day 
And if you don't believe me go and ask St. Thomas 
I don't know where it's going to stop 
Spend your whole time trying to stay 
From breaking down or running away 
Or trying to keep up",Life Shrinks

Well, if you only knew the things you do to me
I'd do anything to confuse the enemy

With the evidence of passing out stamped on her hand

You're no match for that sulky girl

She left her European town before she let the family down
She couldn't stand the Massacre Game

By blackening her name she's smarter than you
Oh isn't it a shame you're gonna lose that sulky girl

Elvis Costello,"I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial
Doing anything my radio advised
With every one of those late night stations
Playing songs, bringing tears to me eyes

I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver
When the switch broke 'cause it's old
They're saying things that I can hardly believe
They really think we're getting out of control

Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice
'Cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do as you are told
You better listen to the radio

I wanna bite the hand that feeds me
I wanna bite that hand so badly
I wanna make them wish they'd never seen me

Some of my friends sit around every evening
And they worry about the times ahead
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
And the promise of an early bed

You either shut up or get cut out
They don't wanna hear about it
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools
Tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel

I bet that isn't all she fakes

And turn it into soap flakes

So good night little school boy, you`d better learn some self control
Did you mess up your hairstyle, pour scorn in your begging bowl

Bare wires from the socket to the bed where you embraced that girl
Did you ever think there`s far too many people in the world?
One day they`ll probably make a movie out of all of this
There won`t even have to be a murder just a slow dissolving kiss",Poor Napoleon

Am I surrendering, or am I replaced?

You`re once a fool for having it
Twice for letting it go

But then, my darling
I've forbidden myself to confess

And I think that I should tell them that you'd make a pretty killing
'Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate
Saying, ""We always knew you'd make it, didn't think you'd come this late""
And now it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun
When everyone in paradise carries a gun

Here we are living in paradise (paradise), living in luxury
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long, you better
Have your fun before it moves along
And you're already looking for another fool like me

Later in the evening when arrangements are made
I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door
'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid
That never go further than floor to floor
You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching
But I'll be at the video and I will be watching

Pay it back one of these days
Once of these days I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days

And then they told me I could be somebody
If I didn't let too much get in my way
And I tried so hard just to be myself
But I keep on fading away
And then the lights went out, I didn't know what to do
If I could fool myself, then maybe I'd fool you

Once of these days I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days

I wouldn't say that I was raised on romance
Let's not get stuck in the past
I love you more than everything in the world
I don't expect that will last

Somebody somewhere must've lied to me

Elvis Costello,"This never was one of the great romances
But I thought you`d always have those young girl`s eyes
But now they look in tired and bitter glances
At the ghost of a man who walks `round in my disguise

I get the feeling that I don`t belong here
But there`s no welcome in the window anyway
And I look down for a number on my key chain
`Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday

There`s a stranger in the house; nobody`s seen his face
But everybody says he`s taken my place
There`s a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And now you say you've got no expectations
But I know you also miss those carefree days
And for all the angry words that passed between us
You still don`t understand me when I say

I don't want to hear another word about young lovers
Or hiding your boyfriend in the cupboard
She's been to see the doctor, so you hope that she recovers

You act dumb, you say you're so numb
You say you don't come under his thumb

Don't want to be a goody-goody
I don't want just anybody
No, I don't want anybody
Saying ""You belong to me, you belong to me""

Your eyes are absent, your mouth is silent
Pumping it like a fire hydrant
Things you say are getting hard to swallow
You're easily led, but you're much too scared to follow

You've been warned, you're going to get torn
No uniform is gonna keep you warm

Elvis Costello,"The poisoned rose
That you gave to me
It left me half alive, and
Half in ecstasy

But if half of your love
Is all I can win
Give me just a fraction
But no more medicine

The poisoned rose
On a Valentine card
That you take straight to the heart, that
You call my junkyard

But if all I can do
Is save pieces of you
The piece of your mind
The piece of your heart

Didn't tear me apart
Like the poisoned rose
I received from you

I don`t know
How we came to grow
Into this very sad affair
Every time we do the decent thing
Somebody spikes the drink
And a single becomes a pair

The poisoned rose
That you wear at your best
That I keep pressed between the white sheets
Where you lie half undressed

I threw away my shirt and shoes
You looked and I dived in
It's just you and me now
'Cause I threw away the gin
I threw away your alibis, and
All your worn-out clothes
Threw myself upon the floor, but
I couldn't throw away

You should've never have been playing with a gun
In those complicated shadows
Well there's a line that you must toe
And it'll soon be time to go
But it's darker than you know in those complicated shadows

All you gangsters and rude clowns
Who were shooting up the town
When you should have found someone to put the blame on
Though the fury's hot and hard
I still see that cold graveyard
There's a solitary stone that's got your name on

You don't have to take it from me
But I know what I spake
You think you're like iron and steel
But iron and steel will bend and break
In those complicated shadows

Go!
Sometimes justice you will find
Is just dumb not color-blind
And your poor shattered mind can't take it all in
All those phantoms and those shades
Should jump up on judgment day
And say to the almighty ""I'm still stinking of sin""

But the jury was dismissed
Took his neck and they give it a twist
So you see you won't be missed in those complicated shadows

You can say just what you like in a voice like a John Ford film
Take the law into your hands
You will soon get tired of killing
In those complicated shadows

Elvis Costello,"One day you're going to have to face
A deep dark truthful mirror
And it's going to tell you things that I still love you too much to say
The sky was just a purple bruise, the ground was iron
And you fell all around the town until you looked the same

The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie
From your tongue trips
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror

Now the flagstone streets where the newspaper shouts
Ring to the boots of roustabouts
And you're never in any doubt, there's something happening somewhere

Well, you chase down the road 'til your fingers bleed
On a fiberglass tumbleweed
Well, you can blow around the town, but it all shuts down the same

The same eyes, the same lips, the same lie
From your tongue trips
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror

So you bay for the boy in the tiger-skin trunks
They set him up, set him up on the stool
He falls down, falls down like a drunk
And you drink 'til you drool
Well, it's his story you'll flatter
You'll stretch him out like a saint
But the canvas that he splattered
Will be the picture that you never paint

Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror
Deep dark, deep dark truthful mirror

A stripping puppet on a liquid stick
Gets into it pretty thick
A butterfly drinks a turtle's tears, but how do you know he really needs it?

'Cause a butterfly feeds on a dead monkey's hand
Jesus wept, he felt abandoned
You're spellbound, baby, there's no doubting that
Did you ever see a stare like a Persian cat?

Be careful darling, you might fall

You said ""young man I do believe you're dying""
I want you
If you need a second opinion as you seem to do these days
I want you
You can look in my eyes and you can count the ways
I want you
Did you mean to tell me but seem to forget?
I want you
Since when were you so generous and inarticulate?
I want you
It's the stupid details that my heart is breaking for
It's the way your shoulders shake and what they're shaking for
I want you
It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing
It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing
I want you
He tossed some tattered compliment your way
I want you
And you were fool enough to love it when he said
""I want you""

The truth can't hurt you, it's just like the dark
It scares you witless
But in time you see things clear and stark

Go on and hurt me then we'll let it drop

I'm afraid I won't know where to stop

I'm not ashamed to say I cried for you

I want to know the things you did that we do too

I want to hear he pleases you more than I do

Elvis Costello,"Outside my window
Not long before sleep arrives
They come with their sirens
And they sweep away all the boys
Busy draining the joy from their lives
They never said their prayers out loud
And while I'm dreaming
There's a passing motor car
That broadcasts a popular song
And a girl appears to be saying
""Do you think that I'm gonna go far?""

Just look at me, I'm having the time of my life
Or something quite like it
When I'm walking out and about
In London's brilliant parade

She's one of those girls that you just can't place
You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face
But of course they knew that when they cast her
Along with the red Routemaster
And the film takes place in an MGB
And a perfect re-creation of ""The Speakeasy""
Everybody looks happy and twisted
Though she probably never existed
For old times' sake
Don't let me awake
I wouldn't want you to walk across Hungerford Bridge
Especially at twilight
Looking through the bolts and the girders
Into the water below
You'll never find your answer there
They sounded the ""all-clear"" in the occidental bazaar
They used to call Oxford Street
Now the bankrupt souls in the city are finally tasting defeat

Don't look at me, I'm having the time of my life
Or something quite like it
When I'm walking out and about
In London's brilliant parade
When I'm walking out and about
In London's brilliant parade

From the gates of St. Mary's, there were horses in Olympia
And a trolley bus in Fulham Broadway
The lions and the tigers in Regents Park
Couldn't pay their way
And now they're not the only ones
At the Hammersmith Palais
In Kensington and Camden Town
There's a part that I used to play
The lovely Diorama is really part of the drama, I'd say

Just look at me, I'm having the time of my life
Or something quite like it

In London's brilliant parade

Elvis Costello,"My science fiction twin
Is doing better than expected
He captured a little blond trophy wife
Who's really very well connected
And when he calls home with his alibi
She says ""Is this really necessary?""
But she knows that a man can't be a man
Unless he's punishing his secretary
He sips in the glow of a '61 vintage
Just as the day is dimming
With every intention of surrendering
To fifty-foot women
Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin

My science fiction twin
Decided to become invisible
He has my eyes, my face, my voice
But he's only happy when I`m miserable
The words flew from his mouth
And they were gently gathered by reporters
Trying to frame his once infamous flame
With tattered pictures of her daughter
Her hair is all made out of porcupine
Her figure is fantastic
But as you know, they corrupted her
So they`re being sarcastic
Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin

He'll scream and shout
Everything is working out just as he predicted
Pride and position in the gallery of attempted people
Oh and the pain is so sweet
Better stamp his little feet
And you'll even have time to pity me
How can you feel content?
You wonder where this fellow went

My science fiction twin
Escorted by his lovely nieces
Filled up his purse dictating verse
While painting masterpieces
His almost universal excellence
Is starting to disturb me
They asked how in the world he does all these things
And he answered ""Superbly""
He's trapped in his own parallel dimension
That's why I`m so forgiving
But how could I possibly forget to mention those fifty-foot women
Who put the fascination back into my science fiction twin

Why can't a woman be just what she seems?
Must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams?

Repeating their offer to each girl they meet

The respect that she needs, it isn't a gift
But it gets hard to lift yourself up
When you don't have the strength to begin with

Why can't a baby sleep at night and dream of the time to come
And never fear the world outside, the touch of someone very near?

If you just bow down"" 

And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria 
You're helping them sell off some new party line 
I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior 
Now you say ""Will you please meet this good friend of mine?"" 
So you're in demand as long as you kiss their hand 
But all the applause is for their name not yours

And if there's any justice at all I'd be punished for it I'd surmise
It will mark the spot very well where I fell

Beneath the shadow of the distorted angel

Elvis Costello,"The party's over
Your time is up
You've had your last pointless teardrop
Washed down in that broken coffee cup
This magic moment concludes when that cigarette ends
Did you get what you wanted?
Well I suppose that depends
Well I suppose that depends

If you go, if you go
Where passion is squandered and money is spent
It's time, it's time
It's time, it's time
It's time, it's time, it's time
You must see it's time that you went
You must see it's time that you went

Our brief acquaintance was such a mistake
Now it seems more like a sentence
Or something you always had to fake
This magic moment concludes when they turn out the light
It's not the days when you leave me
But all I fear are the nights
But all I fear are the nights

[Chorus]
You told the same joke to me too many times
I wish that someone would hit it
Just before you reach
Just before you reach
Just before you reach the punchline

The party's over
Time we broke up
It always seemed like a bad dream
One where I finally woke up
This magic moment concluding our mutual fate
But if you do have to leave me
Who will I have left to hate?
Who will I have left to hate?

[Chorus]",It's Time
Elvis Costello,"I`m just about glad that I knew you once
And it was more than just a passing acquaintance
I`m just about glad that it was a memory
That doesn't need constant maintenance
There are a few things that I regret
But nothing that I need to forget
For all of the courage that we never had
I`m just about glad

[Chorus:]
Just about glad we didn't do that thing
Just about glad we didn't have that fling
Just about glad we didn't give it a try
Just about glad, is that a tear in your eye

And on the few times I rang to propose
There was a man there or so I suppose
The greatest lover that you never had
I`m just about glad

They called time and vodka and lime
In some far flung Canadian club
(Just about glad)
And there I was just waiting to fall
Like a toe just aching to stub
(Just about glad)
Later on I could never accept it
When you finally gave it all to him
(Just about glad)
And you said that my nurse was sweet
But her lamp was just beginning to dim

I`m just about glad
That we never did that thing we were going to do
I`m just about glad I can look you in the eye
But I can`t say the same for you
And though the passion still flutters and flickers
It never got into our knickers
For all of the courage that we never had
I`m just about, I`m just about
I`m just about, I`m just about

[Chorus]

And it`s all just a stupid creation
Of my feverish imagination
If I`m the greatest lover that you never had
I`m just about, I`m just about
I`m just about, I`m just about

Elvis Costello,"All the bedroom lights go out
As the neighborhood gets quiet
Everything in heaven and earth is almost right
But there's a wife who's wondering where her husband could be tonight
And when the phone rang only once she took a dreadful fright

Little things just seem to undermine her confidence in him
He was late this time last week
Who can she turn to when the chance of coincidence is slim
Cause the baby isn't old enough to speak

[Chorus:]
There's been a long honeymoon
She thought too late and spoke too soon
There's no money back guarantee on future happiness
There's been a long honeymoon
If he's out on a date then her life's in ruins
She never thought her love could ever be as strong as this

All the movies and the papers
Feature the murders of lonely women
If he isn't in by ten she'll call up her best friend
Why doesn't he come home
Why does her friends phone keep on ringing
Maybe she should just pretend

[Chorus]",The Long Honeymoon
Elvis Costello,"Shall we agree that just this once
I'm gonna change my life
Until it's just as tiny or important as you like?

And in time we won't even recall that we spoke
Words that turned out to be as big as smoke
As smoke that disappears in the air
There's always something that's smoldering somewhere

[Chorus:]
I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh! It sure made a difference to me
You'll see me off in the distance, I hope
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope.

The promise of indulgence in my confidential voice
Approached immortal danger but you'll never know how close
Then down the hall I overheard such a heavenly choir
They interrupted my evil designs
One day you are up in the clouds
The next thing you're down with the Sweet Adelines

[Chorus]

Lie down baby now don't say a word
There there baby your vision is blurred
Your head is so sore from all of that thinking
I don't want to hurt you now
But I think you're shrinking

You're half-naked ambition and you're half out of your wits
Or several tiny fractions that this portrait still omits
And it's so hard to pick the receiver up when I call
I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose but the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh! It sure made a difference to me
'Cause late in the evening as I sit here moping
With a bamboo needle on a shellac of Chopin
And the cast-iron heart that you failed to tear open
At the other end
At the other end of the telescope",The Other End (Of the Telescope)
Elvis Costello,"It`s started to come to me
Your new career would probably end like this
All that professional lipstick pressed into an amateur kiss
Farewell to the studied lines and carefully broken hearts
The overpowering perfume and the glimpse of her garter
Mingling with the sweet smoldering scent of the martyr
Well it`s starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me

So you began to recognize the well-dressed man that everybody loves
It started when you chopped off all the fingers of those pony skin gloves
Then you cut a hole out where the love light used to shine
Your tears of pleasure equal measure crocodile and brine
You try to laugh it off saying ""I knew all the time...
But it`s starting to come to me"" (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me

Sometimes you bring me down to play reluctant confidant
You say you may reward him if he gives you what you want
But these are days to treasure and to hold
They are much too precious to be sold
You`d probably play the pirate if you weren't so busy digging up the gold

Now you could tell he wanted you `cause you almost taste it on his breath
But you always cheated life just like the bold dare-devil cheated death
Incidentally, late last night your understudy finally got what you deserve
In private she`s seductive but in public she`s prim, porcelain and nervous
Afraid someone will recognize the shame in her eyes
You've still got your dignity or the next best disguise
You never know when to say no and when to compromise
But it`s starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me (come to me, come to me)
Starting to come to me",Starting to Come to Me
Elvis Costello,"You need protection from the physical art of conversation
Though the fist is mightier than the lip, it adds the aggravation

Given half a chance, that I can take
Are you so superior, are you in such pain
Are you made out of porcelain?
When they made you they broke the cast
Don't want to be first, I just want to last

And lies in her splendor for a picture opportunity

The twitching impulses to speak your mind
I'll lend you my microscope and maybe you will find it
Is it in that ugly place that's just behind your face?
Where you keep my picture still, despite the fact that
You had me replaced

Say ""goodbye""
Baby, can't you act your age?
You know why
I'm going to give it to you straight
Although I'll never be
Unhappy as you want me to be
Still, it's all the rage

I'll probably play along
Left to my own devices
Spare me the drone of your advice
The sins of garter and gin
Confession may delay
You know the measuring pole
The merry boots of clay
I've heard it all before
You'll say it anyway

Say ""goodbye""
Baby, can't you act your age?
You know why
I'm going to give it to you straight
Although I'll never be
Unhappy as you want me to be

Alone with your tweezers and your handkerchief
You murder time and truth, love, laughter and belief
So don't try to touch my heart, it's darker than you think
And don't try to read my mind because it's full of disappearing ink

Elvis Costello,"It's at times such as this, she'd be tempted to spit
If she wasn't so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived
Back when legends and history collide

So she looks to her prince, finding he's so charmingly
Slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And she's waiting for passion or humor to strike

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?
All this useless beauty

Good Friday arrived, the sky darkened on time
Till he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said ""it's okay if you cry""

So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny

What shall we do, what shall we do with all this useless beauty?

She won't practice the looks from the great tragic books

To snare the rare and precious jewels

How can I tell you I'm rarer than most

Elvis Costello,"He's out in the woods with his squirrel gun
To try to recapture his anger
He's screaming some words at the top of his lungs
Until he begins to feel younger
But back at his desk in the city we find
Our trembling punch-drunken fighter
Who can't find the strength now to punish the length
Of the ribbon in his little typewriter

Poor fractured Atlas
Threw himself across the mattress
Waving his withering pencil
As if it were a pirate's cutlass
I'm almost certain he's trying to increase his burden
He said ""that's how the child in me planned it
A woman wouldn't understand it""

I believe there was something that I wanted to say
Before I conclude this epistle
But you would forgive me for holding my tongue
'Cause man made the blade and the pistol
Yes, man made the waterfall over the dam

Since he punched a hole in the fabric

Elvis Costello,"I saw a newspaper picture from the political campaign
A woman was kissing a child, who was obviously in pain
She spills with compassion, as that young child's face
In her hands she grips
Can you imagine all that greed and avarice
Coming down on that child's lips

Well I hope I don't die too soon
I pray the Lord my soul to save
Yes I'll be a good boy, I'm trying so hard to behave
Because there's one thing I know, I'd like to live
Long enough to savor
That's when they finally put you in the ground
I'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down

When England was the whore of the world
Margaret was her madam
And the future looked as bright and as clear
As the black tarmacadam
Well I hope that she sleeps well at night,
Isn't haunted by every tiny detail
When she held that lovely face in her hands
All she thought of was betrayal

And now the cynical ones
Say that it all ends the same in the long run
Try telling that to the desperate father
Who just squeezed the life from his only son
And how it's only voices in your head
And dreams you've never dreamt
Try telling him the subtle difference
Between justice and contempt

Try telling me she isn't angry
With this pitiful discontent
When they flaunt it in your face
As you line up for punishment
And then expect you to say thank you
Straighten up, look proud and pleased
Because you've only got the symptoms,
You haven't got the whole disease

Just like a schoolboy,
Whose head's like a tin-can
Filled up with dreams then poured down the drain
Try telling that to the boys on both sides,
Being blown to bits or beaten and maimed
Who takes all the glory and none of the shame

Well I hope you live long now,
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
I think I'll be going before
We fold our arms and start to weep
I never thought for a moment
That human life could be so cheap
But when they finally put you in the ground
They'll stand there laughing and tramp the dirt down",Tramp the Dirt Down

Cherry gave to Victor her prudence and her virus
For the sake of purity I can recall the time and place

With false and lovely modesty
I can recall the names I`ll miss
In the particle of me that cares for this
I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss

Patience has her virtue still
but every grace must have its price
I through some felicity may spin a tale of constant vice
I took my better nature out, drowned it in the babbling stream
Took the blossom of my youth and blew it all to smithereens

And if you still don`t like my song then you can just go to hell
I don`t care if I`m right or wrong or if my typewriter can spell
But I cannot promise you I`ve said ""Goodbye"" to childish things
There`s still some pretty insults left and such sport in threatening

But it gets hard to live

Why can't a woman be just what she seems?
Must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams?
When beauty meets ignorance they shout in the street 
Repeating their offer to each girl they meet

The respect that she needs, it isn't a gift
But it gets hard to lift yourself up
When you don't have the strength to begin with
Why can't a woman stand alone?

Why can't a baby sleep at night and dream of the time to come

If you just bow down""

And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria
You`re helping them sell off some new party line
I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior
Now you say ""Will you please meet this good friend of mine?""

Elvis Costello,"I arose and Marigold lay down with Curious Iris
Cherry gave to Victor her prudence and her virus
For the sake of purity I can recall the time and place
Between wisdom and murder she gave up her
Immaculate face

My poor belated chastity fell foul
Of grown up games
With false and lovely modesty
I can recall the names I'll miss
In the particle of me that cares for this
I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss

Patience has her virtue still but every grace
Must have its price
I through some felicity may spin a tale
Of constant vice
I took my better nature out, drowned it
In the babbling stream
Took the blossom of my youth
And blew it all to smithereens

My poor belated chastity fell foul
Of grown up games
With false and lovely modesty
I can recall the names I'll miss
In the particle of me that cares for this
I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss

And if you still don't like my song
Then you can just go to hell
I don't care if I'm right or wrong or if
My typewriter can spell
But I cannot promise you I've said ""goodbye""
To childish things
There's still some pretty insults left
And such sport in threatening

My poor belated chastity fell foul
Of grown up games
With false and lovely modesty
I can recall the names I'll miss
In the particle of me that cares for this
I betrayed those little atoms with a kiss

And for the sake of clarity
They are ""faith"", ""hope"", and ""charity""

Elvis Costello,"So, this is where he came to hide
When he ran from you?
In a private detective's overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes

[Incomprehensible] Knightsbridge
For a minister of state
Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor's gate

'Cause the high heel he used to be
Has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps
That would follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time?

There's a tuppeny, hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Written in a French letters with some dutch courage
And a German sense of humor

He's got a mind like a sewer
And a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted
And he pays for the privilege

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time?

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought

Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade

Love is always scampering
In a cowering or a fawning
You drink yourself insensitive
And hate yourself in the morning

But will you still love
A man out of time?

But will you still love

Elvis Costello,"They talked to the sister, the father and the mother
With a microphone in one hand and a cheque book in the other

But you can`t put them back together

You can make me a matter of fact
Or a villain in a million
A slip of the tongue is gonna keep me civilian

Instead of all this dumb dumb insolence
I would be happier with amnesia

I got your letter
Now they say I don't care for the color that it paints me

There hung a crescent moon
To light the view
But I don't whisper the words

I wonder how he knows
You say your tongue is tied
Your words escape and hide
But he's so patient and kind
He's prepared to read your mind
That's very well till you find
Because of the wine you drank
Your mind is still a blank

I wonder how he knows
I guess I will wonder until
I pluck up the courage to tell him
How I feel
So close I can feel his heart tremble

Elvis Costello,"Why can't a man stand alone?
Must he be burdened by all that he's taught to consider his own?
His skin and his station, his kin and his crown
His flag and his nation, they just weigh him down

You know pride is a sin that we tend to forgive
But it gets hard to live
When you don't have the love in her heart to begin with
Why can't a man stand alone?

Why can't a woman be just what she seems?
Must she be tarnished by men who can only be men in their dreams?
When beauty meets ignorance, they shout in the street
Repeating their offer to each girl they meet

The respect that she needs, it isn't a gift
But it gets hard to lift yourself up
When you don't have the strength to begin with
Why can't a woman stand alone?

Why can't a baby sleep at night and dream of the time to come
And never fear the world outside, the touch of someone very near?

Elvis Costello,"I expect you're entitled to know why I'm making contact 
With acquaintances scattered all over the land 
I'd promise you now and again that I'd honour the contract

But I don't know why you absolutely deny 
You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down) 
You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down) 

When you first looked away I might say it was really a kindness 
It must have hurt you to see how dreams sour

Well you're getting plenty of both of them now 
And so you parade where appointments are made 
And never meant to be kept 
Unless you accept 

You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down) 
You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down) 

You value the burnt amber of falling leaves 
And you long to delay 
As you feel their breath as they whisper 
""It won't hurt you now to betray 
If you just bow down"" 

And now every time that we meet on the edge of hysteria 
You're helping them sell off some new party line 
I remember a time when you would have seemed so superior 
Now you say ""Will you please meet this good friend of mine?"" 
So you're in demand as long as you kiss their hand 
But all the applause is for their name not yours 

You bowed down (you bowed down, you bowed down)

And you`ll console the heart you stole

Then we started to fight
And it changed everything

You dropped the band, I can't understand it
Not after all we've been through
Words start to fly, my glass jaw and I
Will find one to walk right into

You knocked me out
It was the sweetest punch

I dropped my guard, and that's how it ended
What was I to do
In the blue corner where I seemed to hang suspended?

Then with seconds to go
You delivered the blow

I never thought that it could be like this

What can I do?
Must I watch you?

And it's the same every year
Seems that I remember it as something more, but
You know how children can grow
So strange
I still adore you

What if we never learn from our mistakes?

To pay you the compliments you;re after
You'll hang your sad, aching head
Behind a brittle smile or a shrill of laughter

What if we only get what we deserve?
Somehow I couldn't quite summon the nerve

Upon each anniversary
Then do you ever think of me?
Unwrapping presents that I should have sent

Remember when they were always filled with laughter
But now they're quite deserted
They seem to just echo voices raised in anger
Maybe you will see my face
Reflected there on the pane
In the window up above for long
In broken home

Yet this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

These walls were lined with pictures
Remember the glass we charged in celebration
But now I fill my life up
With all that I can to deaden this sensation
Do you recognize the face
Fixed in that fine silver frame
Were you really so unhappy there
You never said

So this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do to make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Oh, if I could just become forgetful
When night seems endless
Does the extinguished candle care
About the darkness

It's funny how the memory
Will bring you so close then make you disappear
Meanwhile all our friends must choose
Who they will favor, who they will lose
Hang the garland high, or close the door
Or throw away the key

And never know
It's the words that we don't say

So many people you can check up on

Can you find room for me
In your heart somehow? 
I wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved

I guess I'm a victim of loneliness
But why should this be my destiny? 
A foolish man for a lot of my life

There are ashtrays of emotion for the fag ends of the aristocracy

Give us our daily bread in individual slices
And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis

Elvis Costello,"She may be the face I can't forget 
The trace of pleasure or regret 
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay 
She may be the song that summer sings 
Maybe the chill that autumn brings 
Maybe a hundred different things 
Within the measure of a day 

She may be the beauty or the beast 
May be the famine or the feast 
May turn each day into a Heaven or a Hell 
She may be the mirror of my dreams 
A smile reflected in a stream 
She may not be what she may seem 
Inside her shell

She, who always seems so happy in a crowd 
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud 
No one's allowed to see them when they cry 
She may be the love that cannot hope to last 
May come to me from shadows in the past 
That I remember 'till the day I die 

She maybe the reason I survive 
The why and wherefore I'm alive 
The one I'll care for through the rough in many years 

Me, I'll take her laughter her tears 
And make them all my souvenirs 
And where she goes I've got to be 
The meaning of my life is 
She, she

Elvis Costello,"Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs
In between the princess' legs
What with wars and floods and beggars
Not to mention stocks and shares
If you have a moment to spare
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen
They're constructing a time machine
There will be no need for the obituary pages
We can have any hero from the bygone ages
'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages

[Chorus:]
The major and the minor
Turn from tallow into tar
Should we leave them in their place?
Down in damnation's cellar

When any form of deity that you might enjoy
Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame
If it's out there then science can explain it
Or at least remove the blame
And if there's is anyone you'd like to see again
The speak up quickly

Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder
The maddening smile of ""La Giaconda""
The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course
While the punters would probably prefer the horse
You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce

[Chorus:]

Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return
I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we
Cheerfully burn
It's curious
Some will call for justice.
There are murders to solve
What about Hitler? or at least lee Harvey Oswald
Give us this day and everything we squander
Anyone beautiful
Somebody blonder
They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it
Stop press: they've just decided to destroy it

I think that I've lived too long

""I don't know how he chose the pills or the stupid revolver""

It's more than disappointment that we share
You share the same sorry life, the families fight,
That unhappy blade you both invite

But I had to let her go
I live with my regret

Elvis Costello,"I should open with a kiss
For if you`re reading this
You must have opened up your case
And found this letter where I placed it
In between the silk and lace
There were other clues, like your walking shoes
But I still refused to believe
That you were meant to be the first to leave

Everybody here sends you their love
How can I forget you still walk above
Or
Below
Perhaps you`ll never know this purgatory
We never could agree
There`s a thought, there`s a pause
No time to repent
Eternally yours
In a permanent lent

But if I should give you up
If you`re right and life just stops
And I never see your face again
Then from unearthly pleasures, proud and plain
I shall abstain

Unless you know otherwise
Then don`t grieve
You see I had to be the first to leave",The First to Leave
Elvis Costello,"I don't know what I would do 
If this letter should fall into 
Other hands than it should pass through
For other eyes 

He said,""It was nothing...it's over and done""
But the rotten worm was burrowing still 
It's invades me bleeding me white 
For other replies
I searched his pockets 
I searched his eyes 
I searched his wallet for clues and lies 
And I found a number that I somehow dialed
A woman answered, a woman smiled
Then she hung up on the silence unperplexed
Innocently she spun her Rolodex
I dialed again I could not resist
Revealing just the dentist receptionist 

One day we'll laugh about it or maybe we'll curse
But there is one thing that is making it worse
And it's the lack of forgiveness that I can't disguise
No matter how well he lies 
Now we don't know each other anymore 
And when we touch our lips feel sore
I question the longing left in his sighs 
For other eyes",For Other Eyes
Elvis Costello,"I thought I'd write to Juliet's, for she would understand
And when someone is already dead they can no longer let you down
Instead I find myself talking to you, as my oldest friend
Tell me how I can advise someone, that I don't even know,
To welcome death

For I received a letter that is worth reporting
And though it may raise a cynical smile
It leaves a sinking feeling
Like when a soldier in a story says to the sergeant...
""Have you seen my pride and joy?...""
You know the rest...and it's no joke...forgive me please as I quote...
""This is a letter of thanks, as I'm so bored here in I can't say where.
So I'm writing to people that I may never meet
And I was thinking if something you said...""

""I'm a female soldier, my name is Constance.
I enlisted in the military needing funds for college
I'm twenty-three years old and if I do get home alive
I imagine I may think again...""

""I'm sleeping with my eyes open for fear of attack

Elvis Costello,"New South Wales
This fifth day of July, in the year of Our Lord nineteen
Hundred and thirty five

Why must I apologize every time that I sit down to write
Through my own fault I may find
You`re no longer living at this address
Please excuse the lack of news
The feeling of strange privilege
For the hour of trial, in these times of distress
Mean more than years imprisoned by etiquette.

I can remember when we were children
Though I could never imagine this day
Your brother told me we`d live forever
""I`ll go one better,"" I heard myself say
And it seems so strange, now that he`s gone to recall all these

While the years have divided us
Friendships have strained and broken

Daddy can I turn this?
Daddy can I turn this?

The flashing lights go running `round and `round and 'round
It spits out money
It tastes like honey
So drink it down

Daddy

It leaves the slightest chemical taste
It could be most unfortunate
Earrings that jangle before they`re seen
She slaps your face like a tambourine

Elvis Costello,"Sugar cube drop into a yellow cup
What makes the world just waking up
Resolve?
Dissolve
Who knows where on earth it's going to stop?
I can't hear you 'cause we're breaking up
Dissolve, dissolve

And the stones in the track make work for the mechanic
And the birds all fly from the branches in a panic
And a back-fire echoes down the hillside
As the last headline report dies
Dissolve, dissolve

Ice is melting at the distant Pole
The gin and tonic glasses overflow
Dissolve, dissolve
The precious little else that I could say
Your stupid tears of laughter washed away
Dissolve, dissolve

While the poisonous light pours from the picture palace
And it flickers on, tries so hard to be scandalous
A child keeps beating on a toy drum
And the tablets dropped on your tongue
Dissolve, dissolve, dissolve, dissolve

""So salute me in moving frame""
""I might not be there when you look again""
The mourning border card behind the clock
The hour that he passed, unwound and stopped

Elvis Costello,"If dust could only talk
What would we hear it say?
Before it's brushed aside
Just as it's swept away

It's just the evidence
It's of no consequence
It's only flesh and bone
Why don't you leave it alone?

If dust could only speak
Caught in a falling beam
If dust could only cry
If dust could only scream
For it's the single witness that might testify
Could I spit out the truth?
Or would you rather just swallow a lie?

But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint
Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints
And in the theater curtain where they hang a drape
And in the ticket pocket where your hands escape

Before they start to wander
And they start to shrink
You rub your eye a little and appear to blink
And then she caught you staring
She knows just what you're thinking
What got into you was not a ghost as such
It was just dust

Here comes the juggernaut
Here come the poisoners
They choke the life and land
And rob the joy from us
Why do they taste of sugar
Oh, when they're made of money
Here come the lamb of God
And the butcher's boy, Sonny

Well I believe we just

Well I believe we just
Become a speck of dust
Well I believe we just

Elvis Costello,"I spy for the ""Spirit of Curiosity""
All the scandals of each vain monstrosity
I gossip and I pry and I insinuate
If the failure is great, then it tends to fascinate

A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain
Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane
Her lovers fell like skittles in a tenpin bowling lane
But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame

So you jumped back with alarm
Every Elvis has his army, every rattlesnake its charm
Can you still hear me, am I coming through just fine?
Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine

Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?
It's such a shame you had to break the heart
You could have counted on but the last thing you need
Is another episode of blonde

Revolving like a jeweler's figure on a music box
Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks
Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot
Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got
To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon
A tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan this stolen feeling
Amplified up through a busted speaker, blaring and blasting
Advertising, distorted beyond reason
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Elmo

Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?
It's such a shame you had to break the heart
You could have counted on but the last thing you need
Is another episode of blonde

I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays
He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze
She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble
Now they are both living in a soft soap bubble

The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride
The timepiece stretched across a wrist, she couldn't care less, cast aside
The scent that so repelled him that he swore ""insecticide""
And there's a farewell note to mother
That will conclude ""Your loving Son""
""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done""

Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?
Or was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?
It's such a shame, it's such a shame, shame, shame
Shame that you break the heart uou could have counted on
But the last thing you need, yes, the last thing you want
Is another episode of blonde
It's another episode of blonde, oh
It's another episode of blonde

So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees
And names the painting ""Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory""
Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence
And paying off his stalker, it's a legitimate expense
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls with puckered lips
She's a trophy on your arm, a magnet for your money clip
The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say
They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away",Episode of Blonde
Elvis Costello,"This is a calling card
Maybe it will be a farewell note
The poison fountain pen now requires the antidote
And if I avert your gaze
And I should become a shrinking flower
Just punch me on the arm
This could be our finest hour

Till now this was my view
But I'm counting on you
How am I ever going to make you see?
Nothing in this ugly world comes easily
I want you to be

My lovely hooligan
Come by and smash my pane
Till I can see right through
My little blue window

This is a fingerprint
Maybe you will feel a fond caress
But when you start to speak
Are you tempted to confess?

Well, I was a gloomy soul
Never thought I'd see a brighter day
The dark interior
Blows those silver clouds away

Till now this was my view
But I'm counting on you

Elvis Costello,"Signal fading, listen to what I'm saying
Testing, testing
This better be worth all of the breath I'm wasting
Maintaining radio silence from now on

Barricaded in the talk radio station
Hostage taken, the red 'On Air' light shines on
Something cheaper that passes for free speech will have to do

Hear him coming through loud and clear
He's trickling in your ear
He'll tell you anything you want to hear
Tape starts running
He's going to tell you something
Strings start strumming another humdrum conundrum
Signing off now
Maintaining radio silence from now on

But there's one thing I should have said
The hostage will end up dead
It's just a comedy, the hostage is me
So pay the ransom beyond the run-out groove and
Get my wife down here, a helicopter on the roof
No police marksman
Maintaining radio silence from now on

Mystery voices drowned out by too much choice that's
Not to mention
The sad waste of this wonderful invention
Maintaining radio silence from now on

Libraries filled up with failed ideas
There's nothing more for me there
I trust in tender ink and gentle airs

Do those drug dealers still polish women made of wax?
Gangsters and world leaders require the same protection from attack
From a distance it's hard to tell the difference
Between a king and a jack
And a poet and a hack

The fees, the glory
For whoring in the practice of the law
I make my case stop and stutter

And still the truth is distant
I see every evil men do and desire
Got to be more than just a soul for hire

Oranges roll in the gutter

To the red fruit within

But the flavor is

And you say that you only feel bitterness
When you know it's a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

There were blossoms of cherries to crush
There, at the edge of the asphalt tempting fingertips
You stain your hands, press too hard
They'll color your lips

But the flavor is

Is it something you crave
'Cause you say that you only feel bitterness
Would it kill you to show us a little sweetness?

Always a creature of habit
When pity would do
She wore down that heel with no feeling
She kept on her shoes

Those in the know, don't even flatter her, they go one better
""She was selling speedboats in a trade show when I met her""

Look at her now

She looks like she was born to it
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel

She reaches out her arms to me
Imploring ""another melody?""
So she can dance her husband out on the floor
The captains of industry just lie there where they fall

In an eau-de-nil and pale carnation
A satin sash and velvet elevation
She straightens the tipsy headdress of her spouse
While hers recalls a honey house

There'll be no sorrows left to drown
Early in the morning in your evening gown
But it was so much easier
When I was cruel

The entrance hall was arranged with hostesses and ushers
Who turned out to be the younger wives nursing schoolgirl crushes
Parting the waves of those few feint friends
Fingers once offered are now too heavy to extend

The ghostly first wife glides up on stage whispering to raucous talkers
Spilling family secrets out to flunkies and castrato walkers

You turned to me
And all at once
I knew that you had seen
How I was lost in something quite like love
When all I did was dream
Now as evening becomes the dawn
I wonder where you'll be
And just why you turned to me",You Turned to Me
Elvis Costello,"Can you be true?
Can this possibly be real?
I knew quite suddenly
Do you sense how I feel?
I long to hear you whisper my name
'Til you tell me
""My Darling, you may be my man""

There will be days when you must go from my sight
There may be nights when clouds deny us starlight
Only time will tell us
I hope that it speaks gently if it isn't meant to be
Then again
By then we might not be listening so attentively

I will be there
If the days bring torments and trials
To close the distances only measured in miles
I long to hold you all through the night
And to tell you
""My Darling, you make everything seem right""
And then I'll hear you calling in my name
And I'll answer
""My Darling, I may be your man""",Can You Be True?
Elvis Costello,"All the leaves are turning yellow, red and brown
Soon they'll be scattered as they tumble down
Although they may be swept up so invitingly 

I never did what I was told
I trampled through the amber and the burnished gold
But now I clearly see how cruel the young can be

You can convince yourself of anything
If you wish both hard and long
And I believed that life was wonderful
Right up to the moment when love went wrong
I gaze up at the tree-tops and laugh
I need somebody to shake me loose
I want to know what happens next
'Til I don't care at all
There I go
Beginning to fall",Fallen
Elvis Costello,"Hail to the taxis
They go where I go
Farewell the newspapers that know more than I know
Flung under a street-lamp still burning at dawn

I walk the damp streets rather than slumber
Along the fine windows of shameless and plunder
But none of their riches could ever compare
I'm in the mood again

I don't know what's come over me
But it's nothing that I'm doing wrong
You took the breath right out of me
Now you'll find it in the early hours
In a lover's song

I lay my head down on fine linens and satin
Away from the mad-hatters who live in Manhattan

Elvis Costello,"I wasn't very indiscreet and yet
That is a notion that I might as well forget
Friends look at me these days with fond surprise
But when I start to speak they roll their eyes

Let me tell you about her
Hush now, I've said too much
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch
Let me tell you about her
The way that she makes me feel
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal

Some things are too personal
Too intimate to spill
And gentlemen don't speak of them
And this one never will

I wasn't very conversational
Accept to say that, ""You're sensational""

Can hardly move my lips for speaking

So, what is this thing I cannot explain?
I'd blame all the thing I feel but can't quite place

Someone took the words away

Why don't you speak up and say what you mean?
Summon my powers of conversation
I talk to myself
I'm fine
When you're around
Then I decline the invitation

It's strange to finally find myself so tongue-tied
A change has come over me
I'm powerless to express

And if I try my voice will break

Elvis Costello,"These few lines I'll devote
To a marvelous girl covered up with my coat
Pull it up to your chin
I'll hold you until the day will begin

Still
Lying in the shadows this new flame will cast

Upon everything we carry from the past
You were made of every love and each regret
Up until the day we met

There are no words that I'm afraid to hear
Unless they are ""Goodbye, my dear""

Still
I was moving very fast
But in one place
Now you speak my name and set my pulse to race
Sometimes words may tumble out but can't eclipse
The feeling when you press your fingers to my lips

And whisper things to make you blush
And you say, ""Darling, hush
Hush
Still, still""",Still

And now I lie in wait for dawn to break
I'm fairly sure I'm wide awake

Pardon me, if I seem distant and strange
Just tell me when did I stop dreaming?
Let me get this straight
Did I hallucinate?
This fine and helpless feeling
Tell me when did I stop dreaming?

Let me know if you can help me explain
I didn't recognize the danger
But people will talk
Was I just sleepwalking?
Footprints left on the ceiling
Tell me when did I stop dreaming?

Then why should you care?
This is my nightmare
Was this one dream too deep?
Now if I could only sleep

Answer me, if you see the end in sight
I'm just a soul who's lost in limbo

Elvis Costello,"Every single time
It becomes too much
There's nothing I can say
Or I can touch

Time appears to teach
There is nothing quite beyond our reach
Wits may sharpen up
Their cuts and clever flays
Let them squander all of them
You brighten up my darkest gaze

And as a consequence I can see out of the gloom
That I gathered about myself
That I thought would flatter me
What the hell was the matter with me

And says what is
But never asks what isn't

But a voice contains many precious things
It laughs
And then it sings
And all the lies that we can tell
To our foolish selves

Maybe this is the love song that I refused to
Write her when I loved her like I used to
And I fear my heart may spin and fracture
Like tears of stone falling from a statue

But a voice contains all that's true and false
Then cries for someone else
And for some honest tenderness
So I must confess

But if I'd only known
That this would be the last loving remark
You left me in the dark

Then I awoke to my dismay
I thought we'd make it all the way
Allowing myself one more cliche

Maybe it's just a feeling
That I could name
But I'd probably best blame...impatience
You can't miss - what you've never known
It's quite absurd how you started disturbing me so
Sometimes - when I am all alone
I lose my senses
I have no defenses to go
But if this is how I lose my heart
Then I shall just embrace that
My pulse is racing still
I'm secretly thrilled
By the laughter that tumbled
And the tears that I spilled
As far as I know no one ever got killed
By impatience
Tell me - is there danger still?
I took no heed so a word might as well be deed
Although - I'd really like to see you now
I'm almost certain it can't be accomplished with speed
So, if this is how I'll bide my time
Then I will set it down
Til we lose our caution
I'll honor your order

With all the style and finese purchase of armaments
Compassion went out of fashion, that's all your concernment
Sweat it out for thirty seconds on all the prudeness

And now you look like a lover but you're only a tourist

Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg

You get over, you get over
You're worried by her body
She's worryin' about her bodily odor
You pull off

You say that you love her when you really loathe her
Serves you right now she wants you to feed her and clothe her

Don't start your morning moaning or you might wake up in Luxembourg

They're smiling sweetly while they're looking daggers
Kick you where it really matters

And look for your name in last night's obituaries

If you've got the yen, then
You get the shirt off her back and the clock off Big Ben

Struck all these bargains
In the drinking clubs with the council men making
Plans to put lead back in their pencils again

When he ran from you
In a private detective's overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes

Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor's gate

'Cause the high heel he used to be has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around

To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love
A man out of time

There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination

But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Days of dutch courage
Just three French letters and a German sense of humor

He's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege

The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought
Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade

Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning

But you'll thank me for setting you right
While you work to keep angels in heaven

Is the one driven through your heart.

Elvis Costello,"Big nothing. 
He stood in the road outside of town 
With a broken clockwork toy in his hand. 
A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm 
A broken lifeline. 

Big nothing. 
The mechanical amusement sputtered to life in his fist. 
As he clenched, it whirred and died again. 
It was a cowboy who drew his gun, 
But the pistol was welded to the holster 
By age and careless children, 
So it struggled and strained 
And it unwound its own spring. 

Big nothing. 
He didn't need tattoos to show where he'd been 
And who he'd loved. 
It was the same thing that men had cried for; 
That women had dyed their hair for. 
The cellophane illusion of a starry sky 
Stretched over an open sore. 

Big nothing. 
He thought about his lost daughter 
The way her eyes would alight at the greedy circus barker's blackmail song 
How he wanted to smash her skull in when she parroted back, 
'Tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little dolly.' 

Big nothing. 
Big nothing. 
The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. 
There was too much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. 
She took him to bed like an adopted dog. 

Big nothing. 
She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell himself 
The resemblance were pure and coincidental. 
He unleashed his grip on the toy and all it meant to him, 
And it wound down forever. 

Big nothing. 
He woke up in a sweat, the next day. 
With her smile still painted on his mouth 
He walked out of a town called Big Nothing. 

Big nothing. (repeat until fade)",A Town Called Big Nothing (The Long March)
Elvis Costello,"You've been taught that this won't do
They put me in the picture but the film turned blue
A glimpse of you, turning the town red.
A head full of brand new words and a mouth full of shocks
You're a big boy now, with a face to stop clocks.

Turning the town red. 
Turning the town red.

You made your bed, and now you better dream in it.
The word that you once whispered, now you're screamin' it.
Days drip down like bad wallpaper.
Pictures plastered on the ivy creeper between your old toy soldiers
And your mother's sleepers.

They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms
I might recite a small prayer

If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise

Wailing echoes down the corridors
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme

Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
For if I hold my hand outstretched
A little bird comes to me

I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam

Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars
Wailing echoes down the corridors
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""

And in this pit of sadness
Where the rank of wretched plunge
We've buried all the innocents
Now we must bury revenge

They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine

Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance
Though I seemed a long way from my home

It really was no distance
And I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame

Found myself in bedlam
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors
And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause

Was broadcast by Mr. Bartholomew
And now the world is full of sorrow and pain
And it's time for us to speak up again

You're slack and sorry
Such an arrogant brood
The only purpose you serve is to bring us our food
We sit here staring at your pomp and pout
Outside the bars we use for keeping you out

You've taken everything that you wanted
Broke it up and plundered it and hunted
Ever since we said it
You went and took the credit
It's been headed this way since the world began
When a vicious creature took the jump from Monkey to man

Monkey to man

Every time man struggles and fails
He makes up some kind of fairy tales
After all of the misery that he has caused
He denies he's descended from the dinosaurs

Points up to heaven with cathedral spires
All the time indulging in his base desires
Ever since we said it
He went and took the credit
It's been headed this way since the world began
When a vicious creature took the jump from monkey to man

Monkey to man

Big and useless as he has become
With his crying statues and his flying bomb
Goes 'round acting like the chosen one
Excuse us if we treat him like our idiot cousin

He hangs up flowers and bells and rhymes
Hoping to hell someone's forgiven his crimes
Fills up the air with his pride and praise
He's a big disgrace to our beastly ways

In the fashionable nightclubs and finer precincts
Man uses words to dress up his vile instincts

If you had the need
I'd step right in your shoes that you've been walking
'Cause someone put the hurt in you
For everyone to see
And you only have to speak to tell your fortune

There's a story in your voice
Both by damage and by choice
It tells of promises and pleasure
And a tale of wine and woe
The uneasy time to come
And the long way round we go to get there

Once you told me fairy tales
Everybody knows
But I didn't care for their prediction
Now you say you're leaving me
And packing up your clothes
I finally see you were a work of fiction

There's a story in your walk
Then you crumble just like chalk
And I could say that I was sorry
But I wouldn't mean it much
There are pages I can't touch
And something that's been torn out of this chapter

Far away, not far enough
'Cause I can still recall
How it felt when I read that last sentence
Now I go inside some rooms with Gideon in them all
And hide myself from all hope of repentance

There's a story in your eyes
Cheap sunglasses might disguise
But when the bedroom light reveals
All that bravado and that fright
That you cover up in spite
Attempts to strip away this fabrication

There's a story in your voice
Both by damage and by choice
It tells of promises and pleasure
And a tale of wine and woe

And the long way round we go to get there",There's a Story in Your Voice

Till I become the man you barely tolerate
And the blood will pour
And it makes me drunk at the temple door

In another room, that I feel vacant
I can't get used to it just yet

Cursing the very day we met

In another room, where we were before

And lies in her splendor for a picture opportunity
Cover up that bruise, put on patent leather shoes

Despite the contradiction and confusion
Felt tragic without reason
There's malice and there's magic in every season

[Chorus]
From the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf
The other side of Summer
To the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf
The other side of Summer

The automatic gates close up between the shanties and the palace
The blowtorch amusements, the voodoo chalice
The pale pathetic promises that everybody swallows

So help her if you can
'Cos she don't seem to have the attention span

A poor little schoolboy who said ""we don't need no lessons""?

And if that goddess if fit for burning
The sun will struggle up the world will still keep turning

""Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes, look at my eyes""

Because of their mistakes you'd better be wide awake

The absence of perfume
The casual killers
The military curfew
The cardboard city

Tied with love and vicious kisses
You lack lust, you're so lackluster
Is that all the strength you can muster?

Even when we are out of touch
Now I know that I've seen too much, seen too much
So I see us lying back to back

I'll get out before the violence
Or the tears, or the silence

Elvis Costello,"I was tuning in the shine on the light night dial
Doing anything my radio advised
With every one of those late night stations
Playing songs, bringing tears to me eyes

I was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver
When the switch broke 'cause it's old
They're saying things that I can hardly believe
They really think we're getting out of control

Radio is a sound salvation
Radio is cleaning up the nation
They say you better listen to the voice of reason
But they don't give you any choice
'Cause they think that it's treason
So you had better do as you are told
You better listen to the radio

I wanna bite the hand that feeds me
I wanna bite that hand so badly
I wanna make them wish they'd never seen me

Some of my friends sit around every evening
And they worry about the times ahead
But everybody else is overwhelmed by indifference
And the promise of an early bed

You either shut up or get cut out
They don't wanna hear about it
It's only inches on the reel-to-reel
And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools
Tryin' to anaesthetise the way that you feel

Radio is a sound salvation

They say you better listen to the voice of reason

Elvis Costello,"Is it worth it?
A new winter coat and shoes for the wife
And a bicycle on the boy's birthday

It's just a rumor that was spread around town
By the women and children
Soon we'll be shipbuilding

Well, I ask you
The boy said, ?Dad, they're going to take me to task
But I'll be back by Christmas?

It's just a rumor that was spread around town
Somebody said that someone got filled in
For saying that people get killed in
The result of this shipbuilding

With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls

It's just a rumor that was spread around town
A telegram or a picture postcard
Within weeks, they'll be re-opening the shipyards
And notifying the next of kin, once again

Elvis Costello,"How does it feel now? You've been undressed
By a man with a mind like a gutter press
So disappointed to find it's no big sin
Lying skin to skin

Shot with his own gun
Now, dad is keeping mum
Shot with his own gun

Now somebody has to pay
For the one who got away

Losing his touch with each caress
Spend ev'ry evening looking so appealing
He comes without warning, leaves without feeling

Shot with his own gun

On your marks, man, ready, set
Let's get loaded and forget

And he got hit by an emotional ricochet
It's a bit more now than dressing up dolly
Playing house seems so melancholy

The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room
And it's so like Candy

Here lies the lipstick and the face
The colored tablets keep it all in place
And it's so like Candy, so like Candy

What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one
That I have to love so like Candy?

We were so happy then but that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no not that again but that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day so she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy

Elvis Costello,"That Charlie Sedarka was a-playing the piano
Like he was pawing a dirty book
He bit a hole in his big bottom lip and gave his
Very best little boy look
It was a song with a topical verse which I'm
Afraid he then proceeded to sing
Something about the moody doomed love of
The fish-finger king

[Chorus]
You're nobody in this town
You're nobody in this crowd
You're nobody 'til everybody in this town
Thinks you're poison,
Got your number knows it must be avoided
You're nobody 'til everybody in this town
Thinks you're a bastard

Mr. get-good moved up to self-made man row
Although he swears that he's the salt of the earth
He's so proud of the 'kick-me-hard' sign that
They hung on his back at birth
He said 'I appreciate beauty, if I have one, then
It's my fault'
'beauty is on my pillow, beauty is there in
My vault'

[Chorus]

The girl with the eternity rock went down on
Her bookie to buy some stock
Now all her signs in the shopping arcades say
'the corporation thief is the new Jesse James'
Her clothes and her attention were scant, her
Eyes were everywhere,
Her eyes were like absinthe
The little green figures that dance on his screen
Say everything you want to hear and nothing
They mean
They made love while she was changing her dress
She wiped him off she wiped him out and then She made him confess
A little amused by the belief in her power
You must remember this it was the fetish of The hour

They put the slum into slumber and the boot into beauty

Elvis Costello,"Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well, I used to know a girl and I could have sworn
That her name was Veronica

Well, she used to have a carefree mind of her own
And a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure
If her name is Veronica

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

Did the days drag by? Did the favors wane?
Did he roam down the town all the while?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at the door
Reaching out for Veronica?

Well, it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica

On the 'Empress of India'
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
And picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name out loud again

Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

Veronica sits in her favorite chair
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get right
And if they don't then nobody else will

But she used to have a carefree mind of her own
With devilish look in her eye
Saying, ""You can call me anything you like
But my name is Veronica""

Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes

Red dogs under illegal legs

When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Invisible shivers running down my spine

Who are ready to hear the worst
About their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Is not supposed to have a boyfriend
But she's never wanted at home

Talks on the telephone for hours and hours
With the bird in his hand and two on a string
The words of love have an imitation ring

I suppose that you're going to stay all night

And says go and use your imagination

Says just look what I've got
As she sits beside him on the high stool
With his arm around her neck, snowball in one hand
And the other full of imitation jewels

She fingers a string of pearls
An imitation but he'll never know it
Imitation lashes flutter above
Looking for an imitation of love

Elvis Costello,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild
I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child
The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived
They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived
And they were surprised to see us
So they greeted us with palms
They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms
I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
I wish that I could take something for drowning out the noise
Wailing echoes down the corridors
I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
And everything that I thought fanciful and mocked as too extreme
Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
Now I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
For if I hold my hand outstretched
A little bird comes to me
I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
Escaping from the fingers that were stretching through the bars
Wailing echoes down the corridors
The player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
Ring tone rang out ""Jerusalem""
And in this pit of sadness
Where the rank of wretched plunge
We've buried all the innocents
Now we must bury revenge
They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a mustang
And then they drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
And then they dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine
Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces
Then my thoughts returned to vengeance, but I put up no resistance
Though I seemed a long way from my home
It really was no distance
And I might recite a small prayer
If I ever said them
I lay down on an iron frame
Found myself in bedlam
Bowing like an actor acknowledging applause
Playing the Crusader who was conquering the Moors
And he knew the consequences, but he won't accept the cause

Elvis Costello,"The poisoned rose
That you gave to me
It left me half alive
And half in ecstasy

But if half of your love
Is all I can win
Give me just a fraction
But no more medicine

The poisoned rose
On a valentine card
That you take straight to the heart
That you call my junkyard

But if all I can do
Is save pieces of you
The piece of your mind
The piece of your heart

Didn't tear me apart
Like the poisoned rose
I received from you
I don't know

How we came to grow
Into this very sad affair
Every time we do the decent thing
Somebody spikes the drink
And a single becomes a pair

The poisoned rose
That you wear at your best
That I keep pressed between the white sheets
Where you lie half undressed

I threw away my shirt and shoes
You looked and I dived in
It's just you and me now
'Cause I threw away the gin

I threw away your alibis
And all your worn out clothes
I threw myself upon the floor
But I couldn't throw away

Pump it up when you don't really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it

Down in the pleasure center, hell bent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander
There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand

Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

She's been a bad girl, she's like a chemical
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic
You wanna torture her, you wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her, puttin' up your temp'rature

Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you don't really need it

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission, hit and run transmission

Pump it up when you don't really need it

Ooh, he's so cute, she is watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Long shot at that jumping sign
Invisible shivers running down my spine
Cut to baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says, 'We never close'

Now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window, I wonder who is it

The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst
About their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Just like watching the detectives
Don't get cute, it's just like watching the detectives

And try to find a piece of land

And do respect the women of the world.
Remember you all have mothers.
We got to make this land a better land

Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost all the things that your eyes once promised
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying

Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

And her flawless skin and her petulant pout 
The memory of such a long blond alibi 
Still makes me want to shout out loud 
You ************ when you clear your head my dear 
You can't come out here in those stolen clothes 
Telling me all about some mystery 
I hope she isn't one, I hope she isn't one of those 

Almost ideal eyes 
Viewed through a rosy hue 
So beautiful, trusting 
You find liberal is an insult now and care is what you pay for 
Be sure of what you're wishing for, be careful what you pray for 
When you look into those almost ideal 

Love is smiles, he will hypnotize you wild 
He tries to analyze your dreams 
Fill you up with all his big ideas while he really wants to make you 
Scream out loud at the phony innocence 
And pained pretense and the dismal rage. 
The vacant lot that thankfully time forgot 
Where you never have to act, you never have to act your age 

Almost ideal eyes 
Viewed through a rosy hue 
So beautiful, trusting 
You find stupid is a compliment and thrill is what you play for 
Be sure of what you're wishing for, be careful what you pray for 
When you look into those almost ideal eyes 

In the spirit(?) all your friends look uglier 
And you find you're wearing an evening gown 
Weeping over some tiny broken bird 
While the sky is decorated 
Shocking pink and a dirty shade of brown 
And you think you need to be tranquilized 
A feat that may fit to your new career 
Whatever you invent you'll never be content with 

Almost ideal eyes 
Viewed through a rosy hue 
So beautiful, trusting 
Rebellion is just currency, the moon is what you pay for 
Be sure of what you're looking for, be careful what you pray for 
When you look into those almost ideal eyes

Elvis Costello,"With a handful of backhanders and a bevy of beauty
You're going off limits
Going off duty
Going off the rails
Going off with booty
They tell tales of fiction found on all the criminal types
Lead to a higher ranking man or a face with thin red stripes

The boys next door
The mums and dads
New weds and nearly-deads
Have you ever been had in clubland? 

There's a piece in someone's pocket to do the dirty work
You've come to shoot the pony
They've come to do the jerk
They leave him half way to paradise
They leave you half way to bliss

Meanwhile in clubland they are ready to pull them down

The right to work is traded in for the right to refuse admission
Don't pass out now, there's no refund
(when) did you find out what you were missing

You barely get required sleep to go lingering with contemptment
Thursday to Saturday
Money's gone already

Elvis Costello,"I spy for the ""Spirit of Curiosity""
All the scandals of each vain monstrosity
I gossip and I pry and I insinuate
If the failure is great
Then it tends to fascinate

A tornado dropped a funnel cloud with twenty tons of rain
Though she had the attention span of warm cellophane
Her lovers fell like skittles in a 10-pin bowling lane
But nothing could compare with that explosion of fame

So you jumped back with alarm
Every Elvis has his army
Every rattlesnake its charm
Can you still hear me?
Am I coming through just fine?
Your memory was buried in a simple box of pine

[Chorus:]
Did her green eyes seduce you and make you get so weak?
Was there fire engine red that she left upon your cheek?
It's such a shame you had to break the heart
You could have counted on but the last thing you need is another
...Episode of blonde

Revolving like a jeweler's figure on a music box
Spangled curtain parted and a night-club scene unlocks
Pinned and fixed and fastened in a follow spot
Arms thrown out to everyone, she's giving all she's got
To the last gasp of a wounded bandeon
Tiny man imploring to the ceiling fan
This stolen feeling
Amplified up through a busted speaker
Blaring, blasting, advertising, distorted beyond reason
Into the street where petty crime-coats shadow panic drunkards,
Half out of the taxi cab the barker seized my elbow
He thought I was another lonely, likely pilgrim looking for St.Telmo

[Chorus]

I tried to keep a straight face but you know it never pays
He would stare into those eyes and then vacation in her gaze
She was a cute little ruin that he pulled out of the rubble
Noe they are both living in a soft soap bubble

The film producer's contemplating, entertaining suicide
The picture crumpled in his fist, his runaway child bride
The timepiece stretched across a wrist
She couldn't care less cast aside
The scent that so repelled him that he swore: ""insecticide""
And there's a farewell note to mother
That will conclude ""Your loving Son""
""Oh, tell your other children not to do as I have done.""

[Chorus]

So an artist drags a toothbrush across the first thing that he sees
And names the painting ""Christ's Last Exit into Purgatory""
Receiving secret messages from an alien intelligence
Paying off his stalker it's a legitimate expense
So paste up pictures of those shrill and hollow girls
With puckered lips
She's a trophy on your arm
A magnet for your money clip
The moral of this story is the sorry tale to say
They're pieced with links of chains so they can never run away",Episode of Blonde [Live]
Elvis Costello,"Siren is bending, the radio humming
Sun is breaking through and the storm is coming
The score is obscure, the melody fractured
It went by my window, refused to be captured

I hope that I wake up in time

Good King Neptune came flipping up my street
He was a sad case tripping up the staircase
Friends and relations are laughing at my head
Gathered like crows at the end of my bed

I hope that I wake up in time

If you can't or can't quite
Think again, you can't fight
That you might not be smite

If it's wrong, it's not right
I say it once and I'll say it again
Now and forever and ever, amen

Siren is bending, the radio is humming,
Who do you love now and who are you damning?

Think again, you can't fight
That you might not be smite

Amusements and distractions
And dismantle the contraption and carry it away

It is all these things that make you mine

Not a bird was singing, at least not within my hearing
I was five minutes past caring
Standing in the road just staring

Thought I heard somebody pleading
I thought I heard someone apologize
Some fell down weeping
Others shook their fists up at the skies
And those who were left
Seemed to be wearing disguises

Now there's a queen in waiting
Not enough loving and too much hating
For the prince hidden within her man
Always seems to be hesitating

He said, ""Let her go, let her go, God bless her""
""She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her""
""Except every minute of every hour of every day when I wish I could possess her""

Every man a crawling kingsnake
Every girl a half a heartbreak
Every woman sold into shame
To any son without a name

Are your arms too weak to lift?
Another shovel on the graveyard shift
Here comes the flood if you catch my drift
Where the things that they promised are not a gift

If man falls through the mirror of a lake
They fish him out quick and they call him a fake
Give him all the temptations he can take
Tie him up high 'til his bones break

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up with a slap or a kiss
There must be something better than this
'Cos I don't see how it can get much worse
What do we have to do to send
The river in reverse

I thought I heard somebody laugh
Look out your window
They're chasing shadows in the dark
They're counting widows

I felt a sliver of glass
Saw a cross in splinters
I felt the truce of spring
Dig me out of the trench of winter

So count your blessings when they ask permission
To govern with money and superstition
They tell you it's all for your own protection
'Til you fear your own reflection
But the times are passing from illumination
Like bodies falling from a constellation
An uncivil war divides the nation
So erase the tape on that final ape running down creation
Running down creation

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up with a slap or a kiss
There must be something better than this
Wake me up
Wake me up with a slap or a kiss
There must be something better than this",The River in Reverse
Elvis Costello,"I wore my finest suit of clothes
The sharpest thorn defending the rose
Hot as a pistol
Keen as a blade
The sharpest thorn upon parade

And it's the same most every year
Ghosts of the dear departed are near
We raise our glasses and we cheer
Should old acquaintance disappear
Just as we wipe away a tear

Archangel Michael will lead the way
Archangel Gabriel is ready to play
Although we know we must repent
We hit the scene and look for sins
That haven't even been invented

The strongest cage that guards the prize
The longest lash that covers your eyes
A sight no eyes are meant to know
Then on the third day he arose

Archangel Michael will lead the way
Archangel Gabriel is ready to play
Although we know we must repent
We hit the scene and look for sins
That haven't even been invented

So Good and Evil were having a fight
It lasts much longer than any one night
It may last longer than a life
And turn a mistress into a wife

And so confetti fills the air
My head is aching
My pockets are bare
I didn't recognize their warning

I wasn't born the sharpest thorn
I wasn't born the sharpest thorn

Always the first to blow his horn
His achievements multiply
Pity half of them seem to be lies
Always helps to advertise

Unless he thinks that you're more qualified
Gets so much of his own affection

Must be something he has hidden
Take what you want from what you're given

Shaking his fist at everyone
Couldn't even act his age
If you put him on a stage
You might say he's all the rage

He's got semi-precious gems
Glinting in his signet ring
Needs his fingers and his thumbs
To help him calculate his sums

Can't be bothered to stir himself
Sleeps the whole day long or more

Drains one drink and starts to pour

No matter how long they stay

He laughed too loud then he drank until dark

Elvis Costello,"They looked at her this way every since she was a girl
Mr. Feathers, Mr. Feathers
The echo in every smile that would curl into a leer, oh my dear!
(Oh my dear)
Mr. Feathers is near
(Oh my dear)
The counter is foreign, something is spoiling
It's really appalling
You pleased and you promised
You never saw it through
Nobody knows, the damage that we do
Do you carry it with you?

She passed him out in the street
He suddenly seems so frail as her fast heart beat
She should kick him anyway, sharpen her nails
For eyes that stray, where hands should never stray

She thought she was wanted, ever since she was a girl
Mr. Feathers, Mr. Feathers
The kindness in every smile that would curl into a sneer, oh my dear!
Mr. Feathers is near
Her lover is calling
Something is spoiling
It's really appalling
You pleased and you promised,
You never saw it through
Nobody knows the damage that we do

Elvis Costello,"Day is dawning
Almost sounded like a warning
Wind was rushing through the trees almost falling
I never thought that I'd become
The proud father of my three sons

Years of fragment
Between the shame and the sentiment
For all the years that I might have been absent
I can't do what can't be undone
Oh no, my three songs

I love you more than I can say
What I give to one, the other cannot take away
I bless the day you came to be
With everything that is left to me
Here's your pillow
Go to sleep and I will follow
May you never have anymore sorrows
That's not something that you can count upon
Still I want it for my three sons
My, my, my three sons

Deep in the night I turn cold and sick
But I only curse arithmetic
I bless the day that you came to be
With everything that is left to me

That's the kind of life I've chosen
To see what I've become

Elvis Costello,"Pardon me, Madam, my name is Eve
I think it's time for you to leave
I don't believe that we have met
That's one thing you would not forget

In another time or life
When I was his only wife
When I was his only bride
Before I was torn out from his side

In the orchard apples are withering
In the shadows something is slithering
So go along there if you must
And try to do as I suggest
He's just a gathering of dust

And if he can't recall my name
Tell him to take his time, it's worth recovering
Look at me, and what I'm covered in
I'm covered in shame

I came back looking for my man
Wandered everywhere and then
Stood outside and gazed upon
A beautiful garden, a shimmering pond

See the sunlight on the leaves that dapple
Did you see my little teeth marks on the apple?
Don't close the door on the hand I'm offering
There is always someone on the outside doing all of the suffering

In the orchard, apples are withering
In the shadows, something is slithering
But in another time or life

When I was his only bride
Before I was torn out
Before I was torn out
Before I was torn out

Elvis Costello,"Between last breaths and first regrets
The days dragged on like cigarettes
In the distance martyrs and martinets
Dally, dancing with the empty silhouettes of threats

So, where but heaven does love end
And where on earth does it begin
It's not the kind of love that is pinned
Like a medal
Or presses pennies in a tin

There is hope, and after that, there is only faith
Love like a wraith
Never made me afraid
Consoled as I was by that shade...

Here lie the roses in the ashes
Deep as the barnacles that cling
Just like a lace that runs through everyone and everything

In that other still forever
In that time before the past
I told myself we'd be together
Can you promise me that it will be eternally?

There is hope, and after that, there is only faith
Love like a wraith
Never made me afraid
Consoled as I was
Consoled as I was
Consoled as I was by that shade.",Song With Rose
Elvis Costello,"I can't tell if this is real or if I am sleeping
I'll embroider the truth
And that's so I shall reap
I took things that didn't belong to me
I didn't mean to do you wrong

[Chorus]
Looking back on all that stolen time
Back when I was drinking turpentine
Don't blame me
I only took you in
It takes time to do the poisoning
So let's close the door on this and lock it


And that's all it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
You did everything to me but stopped short of murder
Couldn't move me much closer to keeping my word

While the crowds threw stones at the hangman
The sky fell down
The bells rang

[Chorus]

And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of chemistry
Airless shaft of an underground railway
Effete assassin with a hawk in a sack
The earth will offer us in when our hearts fail
As it swallowed the river running under the track
Under the track yeah

I can't tell if I'm dreaming or if I'll awaken
With a song in my heart that is longing to break
Let it out and let it fly high
Up where the spires scrape the sky

[Chorus]

And that's all that it will ever be
Just an accident of history
Yeah

Airless shaft of an underground railway
Cute assassin with a hawk in a sack

Swallowed the river running under the track

When they called out ""Change partners""
And you waltzed away from me
Now my arms feel so empty 
As I gaze around the floor
And I'll keep on changing partners
Till I hold you once more

Though we danced for one moment 
And too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment 
Somethin' happened to my heart
So I'll keep changing partners 
Till you're in my arms again

I'm contemplating
How I hope I'll find you waiting
At the very end of this crooked line

Love isn't a trial of strength and weakness
Though light into darkness
While some people remark
No worthwhile fire
Ever started without that spark

Elvis Costello,"Down among the wines and spirits
Where a man gets what he merits
Once he was written in letters of nine feet tall
Now he finds how far he's fallen
Since he set his mind on her completely
Oh well I guess that you mustn't have seen him lately
Walking around with a pain that never ceases
He starts to speak and then he falls to pieces

Down among the wines and spirits
Where a man gets what he merits
Lives with the echoing words of their final quarrel
The vacant chamber and the empty barrel
But as he picks himself up from a sawdust floor
Clicks his fingers to that swinging door
Suddenly he's calling out more, more, more
I'm twice the foolish man I was before
Down among the wines and spirits

Bubbles escaping from him from the rim of a glass of grape
She sails through his memory just like a ship of chaplet
As it started to sink he was drinking to drown his sorrows
That fill his nights and they empty his tomorrows
But as he picks himself up from a sawdust floor
Clicks his fingers to that swinging door
Suddenly he's calling out more, more, more

Speaks of invisible things he hardly credits
Down among

Walking around with a head that is fit to burst
A heart full of hurt and a powerful thirst",Down Among the Wines and Spirits
Elvis Costello,"I'm sorry to say that you don't know me
I'm sad in ways you never understood
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth
You always let it pass you by

You said I'd never tell you a lie
Just because I could
Did you really think I was a bad man?

You always said that that should be my middle name
But you don't know the half of it
You don't know how that name fits
You don't know my hidden shame

Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

Well, there's a different kind of prison
And it don't even have to look much like a cell
It's already on your mind, boy, we can see it in your eyes
So, here's the bars and walls as well

Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name
Sure it's easy to be strong
When you know the charge is wrong
But the days and weeks get long
When you've got a hidden shame

Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

I had a friend when I was just a boy
We were like brothers, we would run and hide
And we went walking on a high hillside
And I really don't how it happened

He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye
And not a single word was spoken
I must have pushed him but I don't remember why
And all at once, he lay there broken
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh

Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me

They say you always hurt the one you love
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't
But like my shame that kind of love is always hidden
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head
They never got me for the thing I really did

Hidden shame, shame, shame that I can't get free
From the blame and the torture and the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity?
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me",Hidden Shame

Elvis Costello,"I dreamed of my old lover last night
I wonder if I spoke out loud
And if by chance my husband overheard
He put my face back in the crowd

His eyes were clear and gentle then
He kissed the troubles from my brow
I long to fall to sleep again
And I wonder how he would look now

Would our kids grow sullen or grow strong?
Would their limbs bronze in solitude and sun?
I like the way it feels but then
I rarely dream of anyone

In the songs of shame and the tales of dread
Where they seal the lovers' lips with lead
And all the vines wind through their eyes
Oh but no one knows this passion now
Oh no one knows this passion now

So I keep this fancy to myself
I keep my lipstick twisted tight
I long to fall to sleep again
I dreamed of my old lover last night
I long to fall to sleep again
'Cause I dreamed of my old lover last night",I Dreamed of My Old Lover
Elvis Costello,"Well, there's a difference in the way that you kissed me
And there's a sadness in your eyes that you can't hide
Why do you tremble when I hold you?
I wonder if you feel the same
I felt the chill, before the winter came

But it's easy to say that I won't give in again
I was just tempted for a moment and then some
But it's so easy when you love, to lose to control
Now look here if you will
At the faithful man you stole

I felt the chill, before the winter came
I suffered the guilt and then accepted the blame
I wanted you before you ever spoke my name
But I knew that we would go wrong
Just as they do in all in those old tragic songs
Did that melody haunt your mind?
Just like a linger of perfume
Now you're in someone else's arms,
Locked up in another room

Is there's a difference in the way that he loves you
Is there still sadness in your eyes, you can't deny?
Do you tremble and sigh when he holds you just like I do?
What were you thinking of, to throw away our love?

And it's easy to say that you won't give in again
You were just tempted for a moment and half
But it's so hard when you desire to lose control
I don't know what this feeling is, but it sure seems cold

I felt the chill before the winter came
I suffered the pain and then accepted the shame
I will have lost your love by end of this sad refrain?
I felt the cold, creeping over my skin
Still as the air, until the wind rushed in
Still in control, holding on to my heart and soul
Only inches from sin",I Felt the Chill
Elvis Costello,"When I was away, I needed you so
And now coming I'm home to stay
I won't wake in the night and reach for you
And turn on the light and to my dismay

You're not there
You're never around
Or is it me?
It's so hard to see
I flick off the switch
And stare in dark
And wait for you to appear

[Chorus]
You're my all time doll
I'm out of control
It's broken my mind
But that's not all that you stole
You're my all time doll
You're all I adore
I'd swear to it now, it but I already swore

My eyes are blinded with tears
But it's all my own fault
My lips taste of cruel words
My eyes sting with salt
You can take the way I feel about you
And put it in a vault
You're my all time doll

From near and from far
I've known many a girl,
Now I'm closing in
My heart is beating
Like a whip on a hide
It's raining outside

[Chorus]

Every time I rant and rail
Every time I try and fail
Any time I want to quit
And say, ""That's the end of it""
When I stand and start to leave
You cool my brow, you tug my sleeve
You're my all time doll

I'm walking, I'm pacing, my heart is racing
I swear that clock is running slow
It only speeds up for a moment or so
Each time it's time for me to go

[Chorus]

In the far flung cry of a closing saloon
On the blank back side of that poisonous moon
I tried not to think about you
I thought I was immune

You're my all time doll
You're my all time doll
You're my all time doll",My All Time Doll
Elvis Costello,"I'm cutting up her pure white dress
That I dyed red
That I dyed red
I'm putting scraps in cheap tin lockets
What time erases and memory mocks
I'll send them over the ocean foam
Right into those gentle European homes

The slave ship ""Blessing"" slipped from Liverpool
Over the waves the Royal Navy rules
To go and plunder the Kingdom of Benin
Where certain history ends and shame begins

Dahomey traders paid in powder and shot
Line up their prisoners and they sell them in lots
They packed them tight inside those coffin ships
And took them to the brand new world of auction blocks and whips

So I'm cutting up her pure white dress
That I dyed red
That I dyed red
I'm putting scraps in cheap tin lockets
What time erases and memory mocks
I'll send them over the ocean foam
Right into those gentle European homes

White is the sheet on your fine linen bed
The blood stained red on each cotton thread
The merchants gather at St. George's Hall
To unveil the kneeling slave who is carved upon the wall

So picture the scene on the old Salt House docks
Where they loaded the iron shackles and locks
Between a sandstone crocodile, a barrel and a bale
You will see the nameless faces they were offering for sale

So, I sing the praises of God's glory
As a blue cetacean floats in the basement
An elephant on the second story
They queue all day to see him
In my American Museum

But the Lord will judge us, with fire and thunder
As man continues with all his blunders
It's only money
It's only numbers
Maybe it is time to put aside these fictitious wonders

And man is feeble
Man is puny
And if it should divide the Union
There is no man who should own another

That she had gazed upon
The glass still held an image
The glass still held an image
But it was of a man
I turned from the reflection
To see who it might be
Is that poor vanity quite how she pictures me?

She handed me a mirror
Rather than tell me ""no""
She let slip her handkerchief
Gentle laughter flowed
Just as her lips bestowed
The dashing word like ""brother""
The crushing word like ""friend""
If there was no beginning
How could this be the end?

She handed me mirror
So I could recognize
The distance from my heart to hers
The distance from my heart to hers
The pity in her eyes
She liked my pretty story
I thanked her for her song
And then I wrote a tale not very long to tell
""You are much more than pretty. You are beautiful.""

And that is all she did",She Handed Me a Mirror

Gather round boys for a tale that is tragic and true
On the Mississippi riverboat, ""Magnolia""
No one on board was smelling too sweet
That precious one must have been stamping her feet
Dictating demands all well and fine
A few rods west of the Bridgeport line
But the veil was drawn and the halo slipped
Tippling tinctures and reciting scripture
Faces where slapped just as kid gloves were suffered
Vile threats were uttered and challenges offered
On the Cumberland riverboat, ""E.W. Stephens""
Daggers were drawn on pistols pulled
Staggering 'til dawn filled up with whiskey and rum
And several drunken musicians ran amok
Rampaging with the crew around the deck
And I received a blow that was unkind
It turned my cheek to the color of gentian violet
I wouldn't say that this journey had quite been the highlight
Of the all-American tour
Teetering on the edge of war
Out of the genteel Northern prosceniums
Filled up with imitation Europeans
Down along the river of rough damnations
By the blood-stained cotton and the slave plantations",She Was No Good
Elvis Costello,"It's not very far from sulfur to sugar cane
Everywhere I travel pretty girls call my name
I give them a squeeze and they shoot me a wink
I buy their hard-headed husbands a long cool drink
You better come up smelling sweet 'cos you're a long time stinking
It's a little too late to complain
It's not very far from sulfur to sugar cane

Now if you catch my eye and it seems to run down your leg
It's like striking a match pretty hard upon a powder keg
They tell you from the borders to the waters of the gulf
If you take all the sugar you will end up in the sulfur
And you're burning
Hello baby I'm pleased to meet ya
I wouldn't do you wrong, honey
I wouldn't cheat ya, honey
When can I see you again?
Wrap you up in cellophane
It's not very far from sulfur to sugar cane
It's not very far from sulfur to sugar cane

Then your eyes fill up with brine
When you're drowning in wine
It's like the last days of Rome
With the despots and divine
And there's no place like home for a little doll from China
It's a little too late to complain
It's not very far from sulfur to sugar cane

You can go west to Texas
Go east to Mississippi
You can run out of money
You can run out of pity
Throw open your purse until you're crying for mercy
Go to Alabama
Escape Louisiana
I'm digging like a miner North and South Carolina
And then if you continue you will end up in Virginia",Sulphur to Sugarcane
Elvis Costello,"""Mistreat me darling and I might just disappear""
Upon freighter running dark out of Algiers
Put tiny grains in children's tears
While taking twenty five percent of all those flashbulbs and mementos
From the mechanized divisions rolling over your frontiers

I saw my baby talking to a man to day
Speaking softly in a confidential way
I saw her shadow pull his glove off
As a bluebird flew over
Life's is no pleasure
When you doubt the one you love

Who are all these strangers?

I never will, go back again
Go back into the past
The flood is rising fast
You can break a window and look down
Into a muddy glass
It's mirror or lens to burn

There was a deal done in Benghazi and Belgrade
Upon a scimitar or other crooked blade
Ransacks and loots, vacated suits
And a pistol points but never shoots, 
Army sitting in a locomotive yard without their boots

Upstairs your man is painting rain out in the street
Imagines woman that he's destined still to meet
He's trying sidetrack, one to count on
Caught somewhere between a countess and a courtesan
And it's only love to feign and then it's gone

Who are all these strangers?

He's a privateer as dusk gets near
A brigand after dark, his victim lined with chalk
A corsair, filled with horsehair to the core
Dashed on eyes of adamantine, you despised his stripling whine

That little smudger and the mouthpiece that he's with
Using his claws just like a practiced fingersmith
I dreamed I took his digit prints
And then I sewed then on a villain's hands
Watched him ransom and demand
And then called the flatfoots in

I never will go back again
Go back into the past
The flood is rising fast
You can break the window and look down
Into the muddy glass
For it's a mirror or lens to burn

Who are all these strangers?
All these strangers

Sat upon a narrow bed
I thought about the things she said
All these strangers

How I wished the night would end
Tried to stop the days ahead
I'd carve her name down in the wood
Some small remembrance if I could",All These Strangers
Elvis Costello,"No one looks in this place for motive or any hope
But for the dead shot of an amber glass
The blue light of a votive

Rain obscured the window
As the pain was dulled by the grains
Absolved by spoons in flames
In fear in time dissolving

It's not for the faint of pulse
Or anybody false
Those amateurs who simply shed their skins
So where are those traitors now, we once called patriots?
Just like those saints who seem to revel in their sins

O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging
After our assassin's work was done
But bells in hands are only there for the wringing
And we were bringing bullets for the new-born king

Trumpet sounds lamenting
Trampling down the blooms of the deceased
The double agent girl and the fallen priest were heading for the border

Somewhere in the high command there stayed the palest hand
Who saw the order countermand
Erased the tape recorder and then they hung him from a window cord

Swallow down that voodoo vial and stay your breath a while
Before we spill this tale that we had spun
And now I shall now confide all that I have denied
Oh I'm so sorry for the things I've done

Came howling out of the wilderness

Don't doubt my eyes
They betray the past
And I've already forgotten
Much more than you will ever know""

Ten thousand one-way tickets to the sparkling coast
From the blank interior

Everybody's either talking in code
Or getting ready to explode

Then she was singing with five-piece band
But seems that no-one wants this sound

Why do you do me down, Mister?
Sing ""Hallelujah,"" Sister
Turn up the volume, just to turn it down
The trivial secrets buried with profound
It's enough to put a church underground
It's enough to put a church underground

The shaft of fanlight streaked with rain
Poured through the glass, punched through the pain
A holy picture hidden in the midden of that poisoned stitch
Her lonely voice was just a ruin in these riches

She must have been dreaming this all along
Could she be redeeming herself in song?
""I'm no-one's martyred, plaster saint
Below the grease, beneath the paint""

I'm rolling like barrel
Swinging like a gallows
I'm rising up fast like all hell and all hallows

Elvis Costello,"I sat in a motel room with the doctor
Just before we were supposed to sing
He said regarding this guardian wing
This black and clipped misshapen thing
Hobbling on from claw to ring
Hung upside down and cawing
Pecking at carrion of the fallen
Battalion
Thawing
On frozen mooring

Blackbird in a crust no more
They fell down four and twenty
Bloodstained on the land of want and plenty
Now raven's standing at his shoulder
Stared with eyes of molten solder
Dripping on a lacquer box
Introducing the keys to locks
Seven talents there where hidden
Mysterious and some forbidden

Take the honey from the comb
Ravel thread around the loom
Dig the dirt up from the tomb
Dr. Watson, I presume

One will follow
Two unknown sorrow
Three for laughter
Four ever after
Five-foot flood the waters hit
Six feet deep, the eternal pit
Seven prayers and seven pleas
To eight imagined deities
Cat o' nine tails
Cat of nine lives
Brides turned into old wives tales
Your complexion colors then it pales
And into the sunset it sails

Soon these secrets will be scattered
Heaven knows what lies inside

A lifetime to decide

Maybe one day you will discover
All the pain that lies behind
You and your unfortunate love

Somebody might be more
Unsuitable and strange
With eyes that offer everything
And are capable of danger

My mind turns over lies you told
Things said to your other lover
Sweet as they had been to me
You lay there telling them to each other

Now I stand outside the door
My head is filled phrases
Inside someone's calling out
Their voices rise with praises

Five small words
""I don't want you anymore""
Five small words
""Well who's keeping score""
Coward that you are, you would faithlessly implore
""Baby please don't leave me""
""Why don't you believe me?""
""Why did you deceive me?""

It didn't take some shiny dagger
Tattooed fingers grip and hone
I walked under some dark ladder
Heard your final loving moan
All your indiscretions are
So merciful and brief
Genteel poison sprinkled on, your Spanish handkerchief

Past the Cape of Bad Conscience
Into the Gulf of the Cauldron
Roars over the coastline to batter and flatten
Exposing the roots like the dyed hair of slattern

Outside the wind is punching

Faces like meat spoiling

Molly and her gunman
Go down the stairs to a dive like a dungeon
Meanwhile in the backroom there's a girl like a sponge
Saying, ""Bring him in long as a constable's truncheon""

Will you walk us uptown
While our tears run in torrents
To suffer in silence
Or pray for some solace

Will you wash away our sins

And cross-currents

And take out some insurance

Some hearts are a-flutter

Like some said you could
We will feat on your flesh
And drink down your blood
Will you haul down that flag
And dishonor that vow
Cos we must not change
It's color now
Will you walk us uptown

No matter what the price
Each crushed in the corner
Of their own paradise
Will you walk us uptown
Will you walk us uptown

That's always assuming
That you're partly divine
And partly human
Your the king of our hearts
Your the clown with the drum
Will you walk us uptown
If we promise not to run

Will you gather us near

And traitors sneer

Unbuttoning her dress
She's slipping off the hook

She tears away the veil
With her fingernails

She came out high and kicking
While the band played ""Hey, Good Looking""
Do you hear something ticking?

Did somebody tell her she could really be redeemed?
And could she actually be as desperate as she seems?
She's tearing at the seams
She's going to extremes
Nobody told her it was a sin
So she's pulling out the pin

She's taping up her hands just like a boxer will
And they started laughing
But if looks could kill
She'd take them down right now
She's covering her mouth
With some unholy vow
There's nothing more to say
This is her wedding day

Full of shattered glass and mayhem
Not some softly whispered ""Amen""

While the shock announcement dawns
And the smoke begins to thin
Where the world without ends
And the next one begins

Y me lo susurro
Vete a Montevideo y espérame ahí

Y te harán desaparecer
El faro oscurece hay poca esperanza
Cinco minutos con vos

They opened the door and they threw me through
And down I went down, like the twist of a screw
Down into the silver, above me the blue
And you stood there waiting but you never knew
Five Minutes With You

They can scatter the earth and find nothing of worth
Wipe out those years of triangular tears
The colors will fly
And the wild wind will cry I'm strapped to that mast
Knowing they wouldn't last for
Five Minutes With You",Cinco Minutos con Vos
Elvis Costello,"What are you going to say to me?
Will you be betraying me?
Come The Meantimes

Will you be deceiving me?
And beyond believing in me?
Come The Meantimes

He came back, (right back)
And nobody blinked
He came back, (right back)
At least I think that he did
He came back, (right back)
And he ran and he hid
And he muttered and moaned
And said ""Let's go get stoned""

Will you be denying me?
Will you still come crying to me
Come The Meantimes

Are you still obeying me?
Will you still be praying to me?
Come The Meantimes

Will you sit in judgment then?
Be the first one to condemn
Come The Meantimes

Now you've got nobody else to blame
And trouble remembering my name
Will you still be cursing me
Come my anniversary
Come The Meantimes

He came back, (right back)
And they followed and failed
He came back, (right back)
He got hammered and nailed
He came back, (right back)
And he wandered alone
They said let's gather some stones
And make them atone

Now I'm in a hall of mirrors
With my secret thoughts and terrors
Come The Meantimes
And I'm drinking to your health
Find I'm only talking to myself
Come The Meantimes

He came back, (right back)
And nobody blinked
He came back, (right back)
At least I think that he did
He came back, (right back)
Then he ran and he hid
And he muttered and moaned
And said ""Let's go get stoned""

Blossoms fragrant opening
Poppies full of opium
Come The Meantimes
Phony prophets offer hope
That's a different kind of dope
Come The Meantimes

Right now!
Right now!
Right now!
Gather some stones and make them atone

Come The Meantimes
(Let's go get stoned)
Come The Meantimes",Come the Meantimes
