Chroma Key,"so the man was tired and the car was starved
and the sun was setting
no the moon was tired and the cow was carved
i remember every second

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
yes i saw the way you talk to your cell phone

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
then i thought about the man with the shotgun

so the man took a shotgun out of the trunk
waited on the hood with the headlights on
radio was playing christmas songs

later on he thought he saw something
realized he never saw anything
now he drives with his headlights off

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
yeah i saw the way you climbed out the window

forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
forget what you don't know yet
and now you never answer your cell phone",Get Back In The Car
Chroma Key,"""The crew is bedded down for the night, and here's an announcement from mission control.""

""Hello Apollo 11 Houston, we've got the network all configured for the TV, you can, eh, start any time you want, over."" ""Okay, we'll, eh, reconfigure the TV for that.""

""This is Apollo Control Houston at eighty-seven hours and thirty-one minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. The Apollo 11 space craft continues on its frontside pass above the moon. We're now less than ten minutes away from, eh, loss of signal. The Apollo 11 crew are currently in their rest period. We've, eh, received, eh, no indication yet that any of the three crew members are actually sleeping, eh, although all three appear to be in a very restful mode.""

""This is Apollo Control at sixty-one hours thirty-nine minutes. We've had no further conversation with the crew since our last, eh, report. Our flight surgeon says there is no indication at this time that they have begun to sleep. But we expect they'll be, eh, getting to sleep here shortly. Coming up in, eh, less than 10 seconds now we'll be crossing into the sphere of influence of the moon, and our displays will shift from earth reference to moon reference. At sixty-one hours forty-one minutes this is Apollo Control Houston.""

Chroma Key,"saw her at a red light
headlights flashing like shooting stars
in the fast lane like an airplane

never saw the tail light
windshield cracked like an insight
was a long flight but i'm alright now

i can tell you're falling
it's nice to know
i can tell you're falling
it's nice to know

oh no there you go
now i won't be home for the late show
sorry about the window what a nice throw

sometimes i can see
that you finally got me where you want me
guess i can't complain though
'cause i can't go home

i can tell you're falling
it's nice to know
i can tell you're falling

Chroma Key,"""The number you have reached, 9, 1, 1, has been changed...""




",Please Hang Up
Chroma Key,"It was five o'clock 'cause I checked my watch
When I woke back up on the subway
And I missed my stop it was 10 blocks back
But I liked my seat so I kept it
And I'm still surprised that you stayed with me
'till my first mistake of the century
It was so extreme I controlled my dreams
With the radio and the late show

Chroma Key,"""When you drive, you practice mindfulness of driving. It is possible. When you stop at a red light, you look at the red light and smile. You look at the red light, you smile, and you breathe in and out, and sit back, relaxingly. Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out, I smile.""

""And the red light become a friend, become a bell of mindfulness. Something unpleasant become something pleasant. We have the habit energy of wanting to arrive. That is why we want to go as quickly as possible. But according to this practice, we arrive at every moment. Life can be found only in the present moment. Everything that we look for must be found in the present moment. Peace. Joy. Happiness. Buddha. The kingdom of God.""

""What is our final destination? If we abandon the present moment, our final destination may be our death. We don't want to arrive there, we want to go in the direction of life.""

""This concludes Tape 1, A Retreat on the Practice of Mindfulness. Our program continues with Tape 2.""




",When You Drive
Chroma Key,"""time in london now exactly 3:30 in the morning so quite a little while to go so I'm sure you'll enjoy some sleep perhaps watch a movie and enjoy some food not much more to tell you really um there are um start again you can't feel anything unless you're paying attention and if you're in a situation like breaking your leg in a burning building then your attention is on getting out of that building and only once your outside does the leg begin to hurt so in many of these situations what""

Chroma Key,"Automatic cameras, coffee machines, self-cleaning ovens
Fireplace screens, for you, for you

Renovated basements

Chromatics,"Healer,
The lazy cries

Doused in gasoline

Our last goodbye
Waving,

Chromatics,"It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels?
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
You wanna hear about the deal I'm making
You, you and me.

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
Get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder
There's a thunder in our hearts, baby.

So much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, you and me
You and me, won't be unhappy.

And if I only could
Make a deal with God
And get him to swap our places

Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling

But baby you're so far away
If I could only call you my lady
Baby I could be your man
Wise men they say
Only fools fall in love
Why do we fall in love
Baby I just want you to come back
And give us all something to do
Give us all something to do
If you could only feel the flame

Chromatics,"Everybody's got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
I drank the water and I felt alright
I took a pill almost every night
In my mind I was waiting for change
While the world just stayed the same
Everybody's got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards

I can't remember if I like what I said
I can't remember it went straight to my head
I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed
I put a pillow right on top of my head
But I killed for love

I just needed a laugh

When you look deep inside yourself
Well tell me what do you see
Confusion of time again 
Or someplace frozen with me

You know love never turns out
The way we all plan
But the door is still open

Chromatics,"When the world changes to the place so cold
I wonder if I could be your mirror
These days they that no man is an island
But when I dream of who we were I slip away

Like the pages of the book I'd never get to write
On the eastside of the city
Where the ink is running dry
And if you love me like you say
Take this book and burn the page
The rain will wash away the ashes
On the eastside of my heart

Tomorrow when your eyes are growing old
And your reflection starts to turn so cold
I wonder if I could be your mirror
And together we could crack and break forever

Like the pages of the book I'd never get to write
On the eastside of the city
Where the ink is running dry

Chromatics,"The burning flame is flickering now
I say walk with fire
It's the same dream every night
Don't be scared it'll be alright

And if you hold your thoughts too tight
They'll say you can't keep running from the sun

Then morning comes and they're waking up
Drinking blood from a paper cup
It's the same old dream we all had last night
And they'll be there burning next to you

If you say your prayers tonight
Be careful what you ask
And if you lock your windows tight
Daylight still peaks through cracks

High on a hill it calls to me

climb halfway to the stars!

above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Chrome Daddies,"Along about sun up every day, I grab my bucket and I'm on my way
I go down the road a runnin' and a kickin'
I'm headin' for the patch to do some blackberry pickin'
I fill my bucket right to the top
It makes my lips go flippity flop
I hear a little voice and it sounds so sad
It says: Don't pick me now, 'cause I ain't ripe dad!

Blackberry boogie, blackberry boogie
I draws back and make a flip
When it's blackberry pickin' time

I went to see my gal, I set my bucket down
She said: Hi there baby, are you goin' to town?
I said: Uh uh honey, I'm a goin' where they scratch
I'll meet you in a minute in the blackberry patch
She grabs her bucket and she jumps and squeals
I'm headin' for the bushes and she's hot on my heels
I start pickin' on one end, she picks on the other
We meet in the middle and she yells, Oh brother!

Blackberry boogie, blackberry boogie
Oh I love that gal when I meet her in the middle of the patch

We go thru the briars walkin' hand in hand
A-pickin' blackberries just to beat the band
I grab her for a kiss she says: Turn me loose
Your lips are all blue from that blackberry juice
I hugged her once and said: Don't be coy
You know I'm your blackberry pickin' boy
I kissed her then and she let out a sigh and said:

Chromeo,"There must be another way
When she's gone to a better place
And loneliness will hurt you if you can't get through the night
Then the moment starts to fade
And dawn is just an hour away
I feel she's watching over and it gets me through the night

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watched you do it

Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark

Another walk to take
Another lonesome evening spent without you there
And only those who hurt you
Will say patience is a virtue
And it's been so long
And I can't think about it
No, I can't figure it out
It's just the way you're feeling
Every time that you're appealing
Leaves no room for doubt

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)

I couldn't give you what you were looking for
Is that a reason to stab me in the back?
Now tell me, baby what you think about that?

Is it revenge? Is it a sin?
Is that the way you treat your mother fucking friend?
I'm just saying, I do no wrong
I just felt like writing this song

Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave
Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave

You say you're sorry, you say that you still care
Deep down you're mad, you think I did my share
It's so unfair to put the blame on me
You made a mistake, now Shorty can't you see?

Are you selfish, or do you wanna be free?
You have your ways and I can't tell you how to be
You have your morals and you know what's right from wrong
I just hope you hear the lyrics to this song

Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave
Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave

Is it you? Is it me? Is it worth the agony?
What do I do when I wake up? How do I face reality?
Another land, another friend, tell me when this is gonna end?
I can't go through another day thinking that we could fade away

You always told me you wanted something more
I couldn't give you what you were looking for
Is that a reason to stab me in the back?
Now, tell me baby what you think about that?

Is it revenge? Is it a sin?
Is that the way you treat your mother fucking friend?
I'm just saying, I do no wrong
I just felt like writing this song

Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave
Rage! You got me in a state of rage
I've been acting kind of strange
I don't know how to behave

Rage! You got me in a state of rage

If you think romance is dead and gone
Find an old jukebox full of 45's
Pop a nickel in it and dance with me

Write her up, maybe out of touch
You only see schmucks
And you've really had enough
It's not adding up and you just don't understand

Straight shooter, he's a straight shooter
Cut to the chase and he asked if he could do her
P.S. he had a ring on his left hand

Boys are non-committal
Always in the middle
It bothers you a little
It bothers you a little
Why can't we be like Mom & Dad?

Don't wanna settle
Or didn't you get the memo
You only get a date if you're walking in stilettos
This is enough to drive you mad

If you think romance is dead and gone
Find an old jukebox full of 45's
Pop a nickel in it and it all comes back

Chromeo,"It's just one of those hazy memories
I was in the mood for loving
And later that night when I fell asleep
I kept thinking of it

I saw her in the mirror
Thought I could get near enough to whisper
It's just one of those types of memories
I could barely miss her

Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away (carried away)
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away
Because I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you

A smoky atmosphere
I had nothing to fear
The night was young
A message loud and clear
She spoke into my ear
My heart was stung

So I looked to the left, looked to the right
Only one girl was outta sight
And I wanted her
It's just one of those types of memories
And I'm still thinking of her

Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away (carried away)
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away
Because I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you

And the sparks are flying, it's no wonder why
And the lights are shining bright enough
They're almost blinding my eye
I feel like my fate and your fate are combined
On the floor tonight
'Cause no one escapes from lust

Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
Because, I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you",Play the Fool
Chromeo,"An electrifying moment
A blast of lightning through the storm
Should have seen it as an omen
But I chose to carry on

This is what those tales are made of
It was rather true to form
A boy sees girl then his knees just drop
Heartbeat stops

I care for you
And I'll switch the word up if you want me to
I care for you
But caring is so see-through
The sequel is a thing we call love

I can't leave you alone
It's rattling my bones
I can feel it
It's just the start and this is something good

I can't leave you alone
It's rattling my bones
I can feel it
It's just the start and this is something good

Something good, something good, something good, this is something good
Something good, something good, something good, this is something good
Something good, something good, something good, this is something good
Something good, something good, something good, this is something good

I can never lie
I'm sweating but my hands are dry
Say the word and I'm the first one running
I'm the first one running

And every little move you make is no mistake
So don't just take me for a pretender
I'm a contender

I care for you
And I'll switch the word up if you want me to
I care for you
But caring is so see-through
The sequel is a thing we call love

I think I'm ready to walk outside with you

[Chorus]

Because I want to thank you for giving me your all
Because it means so much to me

Well this is nonsense
Why didn't I concentrate to find some time to
Tell you that I haven't
Been on the same page as you for a while
Been saving truth in a pile
Standing in front of it
Obstructing your view with my smile
I'm sorry for all of it
I'm sorry for all of it
I'm sorry for calling to you to call in quits
But i hope this isn't it

[Chorus: x 2]

Lines in my face are becoming more apparent
I stare with the same eyes as my moms parent
People i can be scared with are the ones to Cherish
And i hope some day I'll be able to say that i Shared it

Chronic Future,"Inspiring, shining, rising
And when you're in my way
I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together
Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather
The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure
Is me manifested as you in this endeavor
Once responsibility is taken I can render
Experience to be however I want to remember

[Chorus]
Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios
Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the arrogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when their putting out your candles
Predictions can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light

There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences you missed
So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss

[Chorus:Repeat x3]",Time and Time Again
Chronic Future,"Did I wait too long
It made me somber, wondering onward
Stronger, on and on
But I'm still awake
You haven't killed me
I am willing to persevere another day

[Chorus: 2X]
You can run away 
But you can't escape
All these wicked games

[Repeat: 2X]
You're impossible like ignoring the habit of breathing
I'm expendable to you completed then superseded

I insist it ends
My circumstances, burned my chances
The answers want it that way
But I'm still awake
I have opponents
I've got moments to own that know my way

[Chorus: 2X]

But it still exists and it's still there
You can't escape these wicked games

Go through your pain and struggle but maintain the knowing
Of what'll come to you showing, it's all right
There's plenty around to drown you
Pronounciate found to all that surround you

Give them all flight
Running away is a stain 
In the mud a brain stem with a plug
When you get there you don't know why you came

You end up going where your knowing
Is showing in different form 
But inside you feel the same
There's always someone else to blame


Now this was a long, long time ago
When music was loved on the radio
Before my birth, I'm not that old
Bands didn't have to pay the radio to be sold

I'm told, it was quite a day
To have a station have a dj
Not have a play list of what he'd play
Or a PD wanting it their way

Just a love for tunes and comparison
Now we just compare embarrassment
It's such a scare this carelessness
It's not awareness, it's harassment

Cherish this choice that we have
Not to listen if it gets bad
Not to listen if it's  add
Don't have to bitch and kick and get sad

That it takes ten days of supervision
For you to find a good song to listen
I got mine new to tradition
Let's just break this new tradition

Play the game, play the game
Place your blame on a taste of fame
Play the same way, a faceless name would play the game
Play the game",Wicked Games

More than I can take
I don't exactly know just what to say to you

Then who would you get to lend you a new menu of gifts
To spit quick and then shift to the next on your list

I have to ask you how did you pass through your own erosion
Could you help me get through this life with you instead of
Me impeaching the breeze of your breath for every issue
I can't give up I gotta keep trying as hard as possible
And never throw at you the me that compromised with stappable

Chronic Future,"Well all these people of the city will keep you in their blind spots
Especially when they know that you're out looking to sign dots
I tried to tell this girl how twisted my mind got
But it's her dream to ride the conveyer belt of that side walk
She's got intentions of being number one
But can she handle rejection in the city of no sun
Where bricks change colors faster than careers do
And few people drive away and like what's in their rearview

New York city's so far away
But I can't wait even for one more day
They say these things come and these things go
But if I don't try I'll never know

She don't care what it takes
She knows she's got the ability
And with what her folks make
You know she'd have stability
She just needs to get out there
And step toward her validity
She can't keep dying over this
Because it's just killing me
She's not used to foot steps digging in her chest
High heeled investments and suites getting undressed
Growing old and having new recruits become the best
And finding that she's stepped on everyone and no one's left

Well it hurts like walking barefoot on light bulbs
Smashing ideas with open skin
Till the pearl white drops of blood turn red
And everyone can tell
That you've worked hard enough
It's time to go
Go get your map and compass and don't listen to them
And don't think about how much time you're fixing to spend
The dirt only ends when the pavement begins
This is your heart your dream
And you're your only friend so go

You can kick the earth as hard as you want
To show your frustration
Or you can get in your car and kick your foot to the gas
And keep accelerating till you hit your destination

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

No cure like a deodorant

That if you talk up or walk up into myface
That wouldn't become a big public disgrace

And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender
And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender
And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake
Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well
I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater
You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper
And paprika on your face, like mace
So you can taste immediately
Just like the base that went up your nose previously
So it seems you're too zooed to battle
Word's up chump, acne bump, skidaddle
You're a nine, I'm a ten
Victory is mine agai, this Bud's for me
So here, take a Heineken
With your self-esteem, you will never redeem
Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream
That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me
But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it
Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical
This is not the late show
And I'm not Arsenio Hall
But quite tall with the gall
And I have magic and I can play ball
And guys won't boo this, girls will just screw this
It's ludicrous but we can dothis
'Cause you're new to this, Brutus
I'm so smooth that I'm the smoothest
I'm not handsome but I am the cutest you ever had
That's why I'm so glad that I'm so good I'm bad",Ya Bad Chubbs

You're so soft and delicate, may I get, funky
(Funky!)  I'm not a sex junkie
I would like to get high upon your love
You're so silky smooth, just like a dove
It might sound odd
I gave birth the second time around at the promenade
Deck, kissed your neck
You gave me more than a peck, but wait a sec
Am I goin' too fast, should I just chill
And cool things down, until
I know whassup and I know how you really feel
'Cause I got no time for a brain game
But you play one anyway for about a half a year

Upon my knees, I tell you do I care
Maybe this year, maybe this year

Chubb Rock,"[Verse One]
Now here comes the one on the scene to redeem, a dream
seen a couple of years ago when I was just a teen..ager
The need to come off at that particular time wasn't major
Now I have to wear a pager
on my waist just in case I have to go someplace
somewhere can't bear to be late, cause the race is on
for all with the ruffneck song
Even though they weren't born in the Caribbean like me
And others that were all brothers there's a lot in the pot
Floridian(?) Sibian(?) to be Divvian(?)
I waited for a few for mine, I knew the time was gonna come
You can bet I'ma collect the whole lump sum
of the green, the revenue, the ducats, the monies
is whatever you call it there's some complementary honies
I'm just the ultimate Don Juan nig-Jacabozi(?)
Never fell, I can spell, F-E-L-L like Yahtzee
For each I'm gonna reach and teach with the speech
If you riff, I'ma flip like Nadia Comaneci
Win the gold; the bronze is for Hans and Franz
I'm not (?) on no dirty hoes, I know the pros and cons
which will enable me to wear a cable
and collect large sums of funds
and here he - here comes - The One

[Verse Two]
Now here comes the man - the man that had the plan
that in one year he will gain a million fans
Heh - and if you map it out he did
accomplish and astonish, grabbin the hearts of every kid
Yes I've created a realistic mirage in my garage
that one day Chubb'll be large
Not large in the sense that I'll be immense
but my financial status and my pockets'll be the fattest around
with a boomin sound which bounds
to give Hitman Howie Tee a royal crown
on his head or his noggin I don't how be loggin(?)
or the simple sounds you hear in your Walkman when joggin
or toboggan down the hill with a few minutes to kill
You flipped in the tape you just barely escaped
that tree in your way you just realized that hey,
you have to be very careful of the tape that you play
If it's one of mine, you have to sit and relax
and max and prepare to hear funky tracks
and the lyrical storm cause when it rains it pours
into retail stores, a little comedic and yours
But you know, deep in the gut, the nut
was you-know-what, all over the cut
Yes we worked real hard to make it def and it was fun
And made it suitable to be ripped by - The One

[Verse Three]
The One - has the mentality of
an ignorant ruffneck, but then to get loved
is in my heart even though externally I rarely show it
I'm not the guy you want to go wit'
If there's beef, I'm the butcher that will go and settle it
I don't preach their rhetorhic
The One hates when you say he's number two
or number eight on the countdown - my sound
is unique, you sleep, you'll weap
You'll wreak of my words dangles in your cheeks
So spit em out now, read about thou - take our your camera
Take a flick of the man with the stamina
to get your girl Tabitha to have a crush on this
I don't use Nautilus - cause I don't pump no weights to get dates
The One is the only one
and I shall not have no other one but this one - word up!
Yo Howie, flick on the beat, show me where the rhyme at
and then the jam will kick like Timac(?)
Howie takes a style when he's developing my track
so you'll have the feeling of the flavor to buy that
so your audible appendages will be numb
And say, ""Where did hip-hop get 'em from?""
Long live the ANC, Walter Sisulu
from South Africa, Mr. Mandela you're the real one",The One
Chubb Rock,"Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities
Won't break bread or split the peas
But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups
Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits
Armani or maybe Versace
Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics
Judicial alcoholics
Cover up versions of death in the Persian
Now a right angle equals eighty degrees
The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE
The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros
Bush is steady watching us
How can we kill their Asiatic crew
Ahh develop a harsh addictive brew
Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it
Part one of the hatred

The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's
I myself I can't stay calm
I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy
School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI
But my self inner-self breaks North
And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth
Of my heritage who will bring forth the people
In all people there lies that certain evil
The enemy within spreads to the next of kin
A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke
Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt
To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault
Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain
Put down the brew have a brain
The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake
Then comes the real hate

Why should you hate me?  What have I done?
We all have eight fingers and two thumbs
To feel the oppression so every studio session
I try to kick a positive lesson
U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall
Brotherly love is melting like a candle
Humanity without human beings
They even said Chubb was against Koreans
I just wanted to state the facts
It seems that no one is against Blacks
Uhh, what should we do?  Should we run?
Uhh, if we run we'll succumb
They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so
And the dark so rule the bank so
So you know that they're mad so
This style developed by Shabba Ranks so
And with that I want to give thanks so
To the temperament of the strength of Miss Parks
But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark
The hatred",The Hatred
Chubb Rock,"What you're trying to tell me G
If I walk down to the corner and shop I'm a goner
A Bodega is a no-no so where should I get my grub
Without you idiots trying to rub -- me out
Cause I'm the victim on your main route
You take me out and you might get some clout
Anger is driving around in a red Wrangler
Looking for all you black stranglers
To squeeze your reasoning try to find the answer
You try to rob you'll get a Jolly Rancher
For ya dragon, brotherly strength and gaggin
Put away the gun son, run
for cover, seek sanctuary with your mother
Ahh my brother

My brother four times
Take the time to check the clock and don't smother
Other being when both are already fleeing
From the same oppression, the lesson
here has been ignored for many years and years
Fears has created many hostile years
Hoover sustained the first hate maneuver
Jiggaboo and now I have to also be afraid of you
Think like Brown or Franklin and be thanking
The one you pray to, they're after you too
Don't try to switch, they're not after no other
But us my brother

Mississippit Burning gets my stomach churning and yearning
I d on't care how much we're earning
Each year we dissipate in the air yeah
Change our line of thought put away the damn quart
of brew the intoxicated crew knew
We couldn't come hither if we're destroying our liver
So what should we do earn our little pittance
And act real ignorant just like the Buttmins
Put away our t hings and sing a different sound
Come home and you might get beat down
Down down down you won't touch no other
Why not no other, my brother",My Brother

Here we go
[ Chubb Rock ]
I arrive from the steps of Sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still dig Van, ya dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voodoo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay?
Where's the 'pink Cadillacs protected by' whoever?
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians want to protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

Beef
Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

[ Skoob ]
While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin
When I rock with Chubb you block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood

[ Krazy Drazy ]
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The Hit Squad, Chubb Rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef

At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

[ PMD ]
Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best? But let it rest, because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, PMD, Chubb Rock

[ Chubb Rock ]
Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube - anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin'
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth - that's insane
And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef

Where you slave to the rhythm of con-troling the masters

Whether you straight hit or you go strictly Dyke
Dick Van, no drugs I only snort Dristan
And I point to the sister, and yes I can can
A, gangsta lean get funky like a latrine and
lyrics scream deep into the +Roots+ like Ben Vereen
Rockin, the Apple, since the Mayor were (?)

No real award given to the, funkiest hits and
lyrics get prolific and, kids start to sip it
Esophagus start bulge, specific and centrific
Get a dollar, if I sell more than the group Abba
The Source critics still want to diss my yabba, dabba-da-doo
The pulse that revived the crash crew
If I'm rockin, on the ra-a-adio eww
Why they, can't downgrade but if they try
I rock from Brooklyn to that Crooked-Letter-I

The un-thinkable flow is fly plus extra napkins
And the girls 'pon Flatbush look stush without my googles
And look as they squint then I blink push up the throttle

If I want to smoke ya spliff I might get, stiffer than penis

with freeze love ran land butt rub and blue ooh

Thou shalt not have no other great one but me

I said, ""let there be a light,"" and there was light
And the breeze (?), like that kid who made ""I-ight""
But men took mad dominion, over men
Hard bondage with backs and, knees that must bend
But only in prayer, I make your head need ibuprof'/bayer
Call me, the number one player
But hey.. the one pharoahes, parlayed
In the land of egypt, when that slave shit behaved
Bythia(?) drew me, from the nile to smile on the people
After me there will be a sequel
And I'll praise my name, in the jam
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

Hehe, I live in the souls of men, and women
And pilgrims and children who wiggle, to the rhythm
Just go, the people have corrupted themselves
They toke the devil's smoke, puffing their l's
I'll send, my only son down, to bless you
And observe how you know him, and that will test you
Years, of sufferation, will burn the nation
With adultery, skirt-chasin and crotch-blazin
You never learn - look how many times I kilt ya
I burnt ya, I drowned ya, I froze ya
I stripped your land and destroyed ya culture
Next time you better give me some

Old school, new school, dumb-ass fools

Like Prince no shame for that past few Sheila's I've dated
Made it, with only one but I'm foreshadowing the rhyme
Like a nice Pirollo(?) wine, life takes time
I'm, one of two and to see it a one who's part of many
The quarters of my thoughts will cost more than a damn penny
Any debate we can correlate as to my release date
A nine-seven slate, New York state will have to check me

Well in the past black men used to work for (?)
My age group was plotting to obtain Dead Nixons
The plot, had three vectors for young prospectors
School, entertain, or become Hannibal Lectors
Stressors, used to stress the best, cess wine
But at that particular time I chose to use my mind
Goody too, size twelve shoe the Troy Ave grew
Waited 'til, after eighteen to introduce the brew
Downed the suds and gave a street buzz
High in the +Forrest+ but stupid is as, stupid does
And, that's all I have to say about that
Flipped a Pulitzer prize script and started rap
Simplistic at first, and the knowledge came later
Rob-ski, Dave Wit, and Swanny on the fader
The struggle was on but the fame was in sight
And the tunnel had a light that distinguished my life

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
The low point was mad low when I lost James Los
Spent eighteen years livin next to this high-pro bro
And that's all I got to say, about that
While I give thanks to the man that my brother and I'm back
Onward, to the medals while the boys aged the mix
To the mental utopia, so walk past the six
And the rhyme and the flow, must stay real tight
Like it's always been in my li-I-ife, my life

Chubb Rock,"[intro/chorus two: g-man]
Whenever you need good lovin
You gotta understand, it takes a man, a man
To keep you satisfied

[chubb rock]
Ha ha ha
Now toys are for boys, men don't need mattel
Objects to manipulate and sell
The women or the girls whichever name flip your curl
Acts for nonsense delivered by the boys of the world
But I!! i.. am.. totally ignorant to that type of pride
Yell, when your groin starts to rebel
Yo l, I told you that we would sell
Oversell to the point now, that the pockets, start to thicken
How in the world did women become chickens
Is it the, alize or the weed
Shredded on the tray, that make the queens flow this way?
Me, I don't need none of that.. type.. drama
No typical style, for the man who rules the genre
The opera, no choir boys, I'll direct your band
Change your tune for the man, and..

[chorus one: g-man]
Whenever you need good lovin
You gotta understand, you need a man, a man
Who can provide..

Ha ha ha ha
To redeem, I heard black men, I mean boys
Sayin they beat their queen, that type rush
Can't paint the scene, dissipates the dream
Of black king, black queen, becomin one team
From actress purses, harlequin romance verses
Ghetto curses, ends up in front of nurses
The yo-g male, the bourgeoise male
The two-car male and the male that needs mail
The woman start to, get empowered by alice walker
Waiting to inhale the fumes of the new yorker
Question - did you trust her, in front of pimps players
And hustlers, does she need a benz or a duster
End of question, start of answer, contradiction
Exhale, dangle in romance fiction
The love test, is like do you need to understand
Don't cram, you need a real man, and..

[chorus one] + [chorus two]

[chubb rock]
Ha ha
While the light gleams in her aspect
Does that mean respect, voiced by franklin, ignored by the inept
Baggy pants wearer, million man march bearer
All those who suffered through the agent orange era
Do we really maim the beautiful ones
The sons similak by anger, while the women get shunned
It's above me, another cop out, another rot out
Swapping +tears for fears+, while we +shout+ out
Past pain, that reverberates the claim
That the disrespect started when we, were in chains
Could be - but should be, it wouldn't be, if we
Real men, scriptured by the zen
And even then, women must know which is which
When their groins itch, for the rich damn
There's a lot to try, to somehow understand
Boys will be boys, but find a real man and..

Kids haven't walked wild since 'Go Stet'

The spirits have haunted your lyrics so I slept

You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
See when I grab the microphone career is finished
You better reroute quick you got it, all wrong
I do not mean to diss you but we simply are the best ones
And you can call him Chubb or you can call me KRS-One
Either way you'll get done, anywhere, any one
Me and lyrics one ton, straighten up and choose one SON
In nineteen-ninety-sess, KRS is in his peak'n
You will weaken and collapse like Michael at the (?)
You talk more ish than a senator
You can't last, just call me enema, cause I'll be in that 
Ass-teroid, heaven to merkatroid
I'm that 6L microphone holdin humanoid
Psychological like Sigmund Freud
But I get annoyed, cause these rappers have no brain
These hardcore rappers crack me up like cocaine
They got no skill or game
They sound like that commercial that be sayin
'Ask for Minoxonil, with Rogaine'
True skills I will explain
The T'Cha breaks the campaign down plain

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Chucho Valdés,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie

Chucho Valdés,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Chucho Valdés,"Se me hizo fácil
Borrar de mi memoria
A esa mujer a quién
Yo amaba tanto
Se me hizo fácil
Borrar de mi este llanto
Ahora la olvido cada día mas y mas.
La abandoné
Porque me fue preciso
Así abandono a la
Mujer que a mi me ofenda
Voy a buscar otro amor que
Me comprenda, este lo olvido
Cada día mas y mas.",Se Me Hizo Facil
Chucho Valdés,"Uno se despide 
Insensiblemente de pequeñas cosas

Lo mismo que un árbol 
Que en tiempo de otoño se queda sin hojas

Al fin la tristeza es la muerte lenta de las simples cosas 
Esas cosas simples que quedan doliendo en el corazón

Uno vuelve siempre a los viejos sitios donde amo la vida 
Y entonces comprende como están de ausentes las cosas queridas

Por eso muchacha no partas ahora soñando el regreso 
Que el amor es simple y a las cosas simples las devora el tiempo

Demorate a ti, en la luz solar de este medio día 
Donde encontraras con el pan al sol la mesa tendida

Por eso muchacha no partas ahora soñando el regreso 
Que el amor es simple y a las cosas simples las devora el tiempo

Uno vuelve siempre a los viejos sitios donde amo la vida",Cancion De Las Simples Cosas
Chucho Valdés,"Con el atardecer
Me iré de aquí 
Me iré sin ti
Me alejare de ti
Con un dolor dentro de mi

Te juro corazón 
Que no es falta de amor
Pero es mejor así
Un día comprenderás 
Que lo hice por tu bien
Que todo fue por ti

La barca en que me iré
Lleva una cruz de olvido
Lleva una cruz de amor
Y en esa cruz sin ti
Me moriré de astio

Culpable no he de ser
De que por mi puedas llorar
Mejor sera partir
Prefiero así que hacerte mal
Yo se que sufriré 
Mi nave cruzara un mar de soledad

Adiós, adiós mi amor
Recuerda que te ame
Que siempre te he de amaré

Esta noche te vas de a de veras
Que difícil tener que olvidarte

Sin sentir que ya no me quieras
Nada me han enseñado los años
Siempre caigo en los mismos errores
Otra vez a brindar con extraños
Y a llorar por los mismos dolores
Tómate esta botella conmigo
En el último trago me besas
Esperemos que no haya testigos
Por si acaso te diera vergüenza

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

Each night, I hurry to
Home where love ways I know

He starts starts to twist and turn and then they wouldnæ?° let him stop

Lookin like a locomotive, here he comes again

Then I went into a dancing motion

I could hear her softly whisper

and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill

Rollin' out of Georgia state

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little 'bout me

And the man, the man sing to the donkey,
But he sing such a sad song, and the guitar he broke.
The donkey stop, the man he reach to get a big jug,
Him and the donkey take a sip o' the drink.

Down the road, oh the dancing donkey,
Head swingin' so high, all the pain now gone.
The man he sing, some song was a gay song,
And the little donkey kept a-dancin' on.

Down the road was the man and the donkey,
So good feel the donkey, so gay was the man.
How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song,
When the man and the donkey kept a-movin' on down the road.",Man and the Donkey

And the days whizzed Together, until someone came between

So long, Havana Moon, I have a Drifting Heart again.

Chuck Berry,"Some people live each week in fun and play
From sweat by you and by me
While we must toil so long each day
Just to stay alive and free

Some people live in homes, so content and reposed
Unrushed through all the woe
While we share that woe
With those who have no woe at all

Some people live with much and care the least
If war should end or stay
While we, with less, pay more for peace
Uum, why should it be this way ?

Oh, the day's sure to come
When we would have to live
In love and peace and happiness
And we will have the will to love
And to give to those who do have less",Some People
Chuck Berry,"Riding along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity runnin' wild
Crusin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

Riding along in my automobile
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go

No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
The night was young and the moon was gold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you image the way I felt
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

Ridin' along in my calaboose
Still trying to get her belt a-loose
All the way home I held a grudge
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge

Chuck Berry,"I've been struggling up here, child, trying to make a living
Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas
No brotherly love, no help, no danger
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers

I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner

I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation
I'm going back to Memphis, back home with my Mama
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas
Back home in Memphis, no moaning and groaning
I know everything will be all right in the morning



",Back to Memphis
Chuck Berry,"Oh well, oh well, I feel so good today
We touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home, from over the seas to the U.S.A.

Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be at my home back in ol' St. Lou

Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway?
From the coast of California to the shores of Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did, till I got back to the U.S.A.

Looking hard for a drive in, searching for a corner cafe
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
Yeah, and a jukebox jumping with records like in the U.S.A.

And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound bus

Her own little son name 'o Johnny B. Goode
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye Johnny
Good bye Johnny B. Goode

She remembered taking money out from gathering crop
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied
But never thought that there would come a day like this
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss

Going, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye Johnny
Bye bye Johnny B. Goode

She finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told 'er he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for 'em by the railroad track

I know a swingin' little joint where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

And if you want to hear some music like the boys are playin'
Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You can't dance, I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby, 'cause you dance so good

Well, in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a tee pee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out

Everybody's scrambling, running around

She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Last time I saw Marie she's waving me good-bye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee","Memphis, Tennessee [Soundtrack Version]"

Chuck Berry,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
With them windshield wipers slappin' time, And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang every song that driver knew, yeah

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free, 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But if feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

Chuck Berry,"As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat,
I thought I spied my future bride a-walking up the street,
I shouted to the driver ""Hey conductor, you must""
""Slow down, I think I see her, please let me off this bus.""

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you got something else to do.

I saw her on the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd tryin' to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. 
Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you're up to somethin' new.

Downtown searching for her, looking all around.
Saw her gettin' in a yellow cab a-heading uptown.
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab.
Slipped a twenty dollar bill, an' told him ""Catch that yellow cab.""

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine. 
Honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you Darling you're up to somethin' new.

She moves around like a wayward summer breeze,
Go, driver, go.  Go on, catch her for me, please.
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier.
Leaning out the taxi window tryin' to make her hear.

Lot of people take it for a game
Once you get it - you're in an awful fix
After you've had it - you never want to quit

Many people don't understand, no no
They think lovin', yeah yeah - is money in the hand
Your sweet lovin' - is better than a kiss, yeah yeah
When you leave me - sweet kisses I miss",Love Is Strange
Chuck Berry,"Love can make a fool of you 
You do anything it wants you to 
Love can make you feel so good - when it goes like you think it should 
Or it can make you cry at night - when your baby don't treat you right 

When you're feeling sad and blue 
You know love's made a fool of you 

You know love makes fools of men 
But you don't care, you're gonna try again 

Time goes by, it's a-passin' fast - you think true love has come at last 
But by and by you're gonna find - crazy love has made you blind

You know love's made a fool of you",Love's Made a Fool of You

California on my mind.
Straddled that greyhound, rode him past raleigh,
On across caroline.

Stopped in charlotte and bypassed rock hill,
And we never was a minute late.
We was ninety miles out of atlanta by sundown,
Rollin' 'cross the georgia state.

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross alabam,
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown birmingham.

Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,
Ridin' cross mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of birmingham
Smoking into new orleans.

Somebody help me get out of louisiana
Just help me get to houston town.
There's people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,
Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

Workin' on a t-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the golden state;
The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

Cut your engines, cool your wings,
And let me make it to the telephone.

Chuck Berry,"Last night, I had a beautiful dream
Last night, in the wee wee hours, oh yes
Had a beautiful dream
Ain't about my childhood sweetheart
How true and real it seemed 

I had dreamt we was walkin'
Hand in hand, home from school
Yeah, I dreamt we was walkin' together
Hand in hand, home from school.
Yeah, if it hadn't be for you darling,
I'd broke my mother's rule.

Yeah, you was only sixteen,
So young and yet so fine
Yeah, you was only sixteen,
So young, yet so fine.
You said when you'd finish school
You'd let me take and make you mine.

Oh yeah
Yeah, you had those same pretty eyes,
Same sweet little smile
You had those same pretty eyes,
Same sweet little smile.
I had dreamt about the sweet things
We used to do, when you was a child 

You were my childhood sweetheart
Love you now, and loved you then
You were my childhood sweetheart
I love you now and I loved you then
And when I'll leave you down the twilight
I'll go to sleep and dream again.",Childhood Sweetheart [Live]
Chuck Berry,"Just let me hear some of that rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock - roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock - roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she could her my man a - whalin' sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were goin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock - roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
Them country folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home - brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock - roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play the tango
I'm in no mood to dig a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep a - rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock - roll music

Chuck Berry,"School Day

Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Keep up the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint, you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance,
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round we go

Hail, hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums, loud and bold
Rock, rock, rock and roll
The feelin' is there, body and soul.","School Days (Ring, Ring Goes the Bell)"
Chuck Berry,"In the heat of the day down in Mobile Alabama
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Tryin' to find somebody to take away these blues
""She don't love me"" hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done

Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a tee pee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles about

Everybody's scrambling, running around
Picking up their money, tearing the tee pee down
Foreman wants to panic, 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on",Almost Grown [#]
Chuck Berry,"She drew out all her money out of the Southern Trust 
And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound Bus 
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West 
Down came the tears from her happiness 
Her own little son name 'o Johnny B. Goode 
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye bye Johnny 
Good bye Johnny B. Goode 
She remembered taking money out from gathering crop 
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop 
As long as he would play it by the railroad side 
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied 
But never thought that there would come a day like this 
When she would have to give her son a goodby kiss 
Going 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye bye Johnny 
Good bye Johnny B. Goode 
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of 
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love 
As soon as he was married he would bring her back 
And build a mansion for 'em by the railroad track 
So every time they heard the locomotive roar 
They'd be a' standin', a' wavin' by the kitchen door 
Howling 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye bye Johnny 
Good bye Johnny B. Goode",Bye Bye Johnny [Stereo Remix][Version]
Chuck Berry,"In the wee, wee hours
That's when I think of you
In the wee, wee hours
That's when I think of you
You say, but yet I wonder
If your love was ever true

In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
I wonder if you still remember
All the things we used to do

One little song
For a fading memory
One little song
For a fading memory
Of the one I really love
The only one for me

Chuck Berry,"I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat,
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street, 
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine 
Honey, is that you? 
Seems like every time I see you 
Darling you got something else to do

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Downtown searching for her, looking all around 
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town 
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab

She move around like a wave of summer breeze,
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze 
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear",Nadine (Is It You?) [#]
Chuck Berry,"Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best

Well it winds from Chicago to L.A.

Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it goes from St Louis, down to Missouri

Chuck Berry,"I bought a brand-new air-mobile
It custom-made, 'twas a Flight De Ville
With a pow'ful motor and some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze

New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me
Then come wavin' by me in a little' old souped-up jitney
I put my foot on my tank and I began to roll
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye bye New Jersey, I've become airborne

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me

Not a gray cloud floatin' in sight
Big full moon shinin' up above
Cuddle up honey, be my love
Sweetest little thing I've ever seen
I'm gonna name you Maybellene
Flyin' on the beam, set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll
Two, three hours passed us by
Five to two dropped to 5:05

You've started back doin' the things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill I saw Maybelline in a Coupe de Ville
Cadillac rollin' on an open road but nothin' outrun my V8 Ford
Cadillac doin' about ninety-five bumper to bumper rollin' side to side
Maybelline why can't you be true...

Well the Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water poured up under my motor hood
I knew that were doin' my motor good
Maybelline why can't you be true...
[ piano - guitar ]
Well the motor cooled down the heat went down and
And that's when I heard that highway sound
Cadillac lookin' like a ton of lead a hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill
Maybelline why can't you be true...
Oh Maybelline Maybelline Maybelline Maybelline...

I got a lotta things on my mind
Like those friends of yours, they keep bringing me down
Just hangin' round all the time

I've had a hard time waking most mornings
And it's been that way for a month or more
And you've had things your way now I've got to say
I'm on my way out the door

Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me
Why don't you get right, try and get right, baby
Don't you remember how it used to be

And I can see it in your empty eyes
But there's no need for talking or walking round the block
Just to figure out the reason why

I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door
'Cuz I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful

Chuck Brown,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I said I come from DC you cant see me
hey Chuckie B let em know what we do
I used to say I would never not in my days, 
ever change my ways, too good at getting away 
with all them games I played smooth walker slick talker anything I did, 
get out of a jam quicker that MacGyver did. Shit
I think I'm sprung now, I seen a dude up town who makes me what to settle down 
and have his son now, he might be the one now, 
I count it funny myself, 
I'll let my daddy Chuck Brown give you the run down.
I was driving in my car one day, I saw a sexy lady walk my way, 
A banging body and a pretty face, s
I whispered in her ear and said
I really love your style and you dress so fly yo
I'd love to see your pretty face in my show
I've been around the world from London to Chicago
but I ain't never met a girl like you.
Shorty took a look into my eyes, and said she heard I was a crazy guy
I hit and run the Georgie Porgy type, 
you like to kiss the girls and make them cry. 
I told her don't believe the hype 'cause I'm cool
Enough about me lets talk about you
I want to get to know you and make you my boo
it's all on you baby, and she said

Chuck baby don't give a what, (and she said)
Chuck baby don't give a ugh, (and he said)
Chuck baby don't give a what (And they said)
Chuck baby don't give a ugh, (and you said)
Chuck baby don't give a what (that ain't true)
chuck baby don't give a ugh, (I love all of you)
Chuck baby don't give a what (you know what I do)
Chuck baby don't give a ugh (ow)

So I shoot a couple of jokes, he laughin' 
and he gigglin, tell by the look in his eyes he knows I'm feelin' him.
Throw a couple of hints, he act like he cant hear
I say I'm going to lunch why don't you meet me there.
I swear, you think he own a store in G-town
he drivin' a hard bargain while I'm trying to talk him down
man you ready or not I can bring a car around
if not then let me know so I can go and shop around.
So I asked her if she had a man. 
She didn't answer so I asked again
and baby I ain't trying to force your hand
baby I'm just tryin' to understand
Why you try to play so hard to get
and my name ain't no Romeo and you ain't Juliet, but she said.

Chuck baby dont give a what (And he said)
Chuck baby don't give a ugh, (and they said)
Chuck baby dont give a what (And you said)
Chuck baby dont give a ugh, (yes I do)

What's the First Amendment?
   
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
   
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
   
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
   
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
   
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
   
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

So don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge

Chuck Dodson,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

You thought you had me baby, but I was infatuated,

I ain't gone cry no more, I'm gonna let you go

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

End it all and let her go to some better man;

Chuck Hedges,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy
Chuck Hedges,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Chuck Hedges,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Chuck Hedges,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Chuck Henderson,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Chuck Inglish,"Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

After tossin' and turnin'
And yearnin' the whole night long 
Pretty baby, since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day

I wake up crying
After sobbin' and sighin'
And wonderin' just what went wrong 
Pretty baby, I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue?
I need your arms to hold me tight
I need your lips to kiss me goodnight
I'm so unhappy on my own 
Don't, don't leave me sad and lonely

Chuck Jackson,"My love
I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that never ends

Without you
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me",You Make Me Feel Brand New
Chuck Jackson,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Chuck Jackson,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Chuck Jackson,"Every day I walk some lonely street
Searchin' 'til you come back to me
People around just stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
And suddenly I realize
I'm cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in a confusion
And my heart feels much confusion
Since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless, since you're not around
I'm helpless

Oh I'm helpless
Since I lost your love
Helpless
'Cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Ever since you've been gone it keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world of grieve
I need your words of confidence
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless feel confusion
And your love is your solution

It's my fault
And I won't search for you no longer
As I go home alone
Needing you to stop

I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
And my mind is in a confusion
And I'm having these strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside keeps me cryin' cryin' cryin' cryin'

Sinners bow their heads

I wish I was dead

They hunted down my river queen,
Nobody laid a hand on me.

They say she died by her own hand.
There was a harmless game of truth or dare,
She grabbed that snake and held it there.

Gone forever 'neath the Memphis moon

Leaned on me till I cried and beg
I cried for my mother, never felt so alone
The dawn was breaking and my will was gone

They said, ""There's two more boys where you came from
You'll implicate them both before we're done
We want that Echols boy with the moody eyes
He and that peach faced kid by his side""

The truth still buried out there in the mud

Father forgive this walking razor blade

Mothers arms reaching in the night

All along the banks of memory, holding tide away.
And on the end of every corner I could almost hear her sound.
Time went by in ecstasy, walking next to walls.
And the color of the water, was the rails that she was on.
And when the whistles blew far away, I felt she knew somehow.

For the train often rattles, from the rails shaking ground.
I close my eyes and almost hear her now.

Took a walk in Rotterdam, dodging spoke and wheel.
And a few unnerving riders, agile or insane.
And the rest, victims of fashion, lord we're all to blame.
Found myself a bar stool, and something on the rocks.
I was dreaming I could ride the sun, westward as it dropped.
And find her at the station, gracefully rolling a stop.

For the train often rattles, from the rails shaking ground.

For when the last hour dies and your eyes grow tired
And the booze don't work no more
And the Bible pages have disintegrated
Found cracks down in the floor
It's you and I alone, walking to the sea
You and I alone is all I ever need
You and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be

2400 miles away under some Southern California star,
While in the city of angels, that angel lays
Calling to her lover on an old sand bar

Oh, it ain't like the given time will wait for our fare
It ain't like if I don't close my eyes
I'll be cursed if I can't meet you there
Open the gates and let the flood carry dirt out

For when the last hour dies and your eyes grow tired
And the booze don't work no more
And the Bible pages have disintegrated, found cracks down in the floor
It's you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone it's all I ever need
You and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be

2400 miles away,
I'm laid out lonely begging for a dream
Of you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone is everything I need
Yeah you and I alone is all I ever dream and where I need to be
Yeah you and I alone walking to the sea
You and I alone everything I need
Yeah you and I alone everything I dream and where I need to be
Yeah you and I alone all I ever dream and where I need to be",You and I Alone

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

I own each summer day, each mountain capped with snow,
The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

On that happy morning when we all shall rise
Oh what glory, Hallelujah

Millions there will join the song, with them we shall be

With your broken heart your shattered dreams
And are you searching for someone who'll be faithful
To you no matter what life brings
Well i know the maker of the storm the sunrise
He is both the lion and the lamb
He is strong enough to shake all earth and heaven
Yet meek enough to take me as I am.

[Chorus]
He says come unto to me 
All who are weary 
And I will give you rest
Bring what hurts 
Bring your scars
Bring the load that you carry
And I will give you rest

Are the clouds above your head oh so heavy
Bursting with showers of despair
And do you struggle under more then you can carry
Has life given more then you can bare
And would you like to trade your failures in for victories
Like piles of ashes in from piles of gold
And can you fall down like a child who is helpless
So he can pick you up and make you whole

Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through

If we loved a little harder

If we loved
If we loved a little harder",If We Loved
Chuck Wicks,"6 A.M and Bobby's wakin' up
Rolls outta bed with sleepy eyes
Goes to his sister's room across the hall
'Hey Daisy rise and shine'
He pours two bowls of Captain Crunch
Puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his momma up off the couch
The bus is here we love you mom

He made the breakfast
He did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to

[Chorus]
Oh he's only ten
This comin' of age he ought to be out playin' ball
And video games
Climbin' trees
Or on a bike just ridin' around
But it's hard to be a kid
When you're the man of the house

It's late at night and Larry King is on
Momma's up on the couch again
Bobby hears them all talk about
That awful war his daddy's in
So he runs off, straight up to his room
Don't want his momma to see him right now
He climbs in bed and says a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't wanna let her down

[Chorus]

It's finally Saturday
Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says, 'I love you dad'
Daddy says it right back
Wish I could reach through this phone
And hug you, and Daisy, and your mom
I'm so proud of you son.'

Chuck Wicks,"Girl you've been so busy
I ain't seen you around
You got the world on your shoulders
Let me help you put it down
Baby, come inside
And leave it all behind

You got your boss, your friends, your family
Every second of the day
People push ya
People pull ya
A million different ways
I'm feelin it too
I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do

Now that I got you here
All to myself
Baby, I ain't sharing you with no one else
You've been everybody else's all week long
But tonight you're mine, all mine

If you go get the blinds
I'll turn off the phone
Then I'll pour a little wine
Baby, make yourself at home
All I wanna do is spend some time on you

Now that I got you here
All to myself
Baby, I ain't sharing you with no one else

But can you blame me

All she's thinking about is sweet revenge
She's gonna hurt somebody
Some fool went and broke her heart

I feel sorry for the guy
That winds up in her arms
He's gonna wake up wondering

Those wild red lips
And one thing on her mind

She walks into the bar
Even in the dark
You can see it in her eyes

Staring at me and I swear

And run straight back to your side

Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know
Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you'll forgive me someday

Nothing gonna slow me down

Would you still walk away
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's too late

What if you're wrong
What if I'm right
That you could move on
What if you stay

I know right now it's hard to breathe
Hard to think and hard to see
All the reasons we should work it out
It might be easier to go,
But if you walk out, you'll never know
How strong we could be at the end of this
I know that sorry is not enough
But I'll do everything, anything to make it up

And what is was that made you let her slip right through your hands

It's not easy
Knowing that you walked away from it all
I bet she's out with somebody just laughing

Keep myself busy to make me feel better
Go out on the town hang out with my friends
Take my mind to places that it's never been
Where I can find somebody new to take away the pain
'Cause when it comes down to the truth
You're still that empty space I find myself in a place
Where I don't really wanna be
I guess there's no getting over you gettin' over me

I still wake up in the morning
Seeing your face
Sing a little song as if you're walking my way
And think about the first time you said hello
I put roses on the kitchen table
Your favorite time of year was always April
The sun would shine through the bedroom window
And brighten up your day

Keeping that space between us all
Is how the west can keep control...
With a mission and a chequebook promising aid
Posing for the camera the United Nations man came
He talked of control and the terrible drought
And the way that the west would bail them out
They he stopped smiling and talked conditions 
Of mutual aid; of American wishes
Sending in aid with sewn-on strings
If they won't buy arms - then it's pulled back in
Feeding the world American style
Col Sanders has an empire behind his smile
Back up the investments with a military regime
Then cleverly say: ""It's to keep the world free!""
But the multinational myths are beginning to fall
The poor don't want aid, they want control
And if we really want to see the Third World eat
We've got to see through the wraping on the high street
Past barriers of culture that dictate our lives
We're busy consuming as the other half dies
And the answer's not a question on charity -
Not whilst profit's still the top priority -
So let the glossy shop-fronts know what to expect

Reclaim our actions, rediscover our voices
Salvage our integrity, reassert our dignity
Power in the heart of the community
Mr. Heseltine listen to me
We don't want power
And we don't want money
We're fighting for the right to decide
How the power and the wealth
Be equally divided
Old people in Seacroft need money for bills
Single mums with kids want decent meals
And we all want new coats
When all's said and done
They're all worn out
From being walked upon
There comes a time when we organize
When we take control of our daily lives
When we don't obey orders from authority
When we disbelieve the myths of democracy

Democracy Street, Britain's longest running soap, with the added illusion of audience participation. Our act tonight, on the left, capitalism that's right, on the right, capitalism is it, in the middle, probably the best capitalism in the world. Remember it's your choice, your five seconds worth of action that counts. I mean that most sincerely voters. Sit tight, keep quiet, 'till the next time. The next time being one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five days away. Well if freedom is the choice between greed and practically the same impression (?), then I'll take the one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five days. Never mind the ballots, here's the rest of your life.

Mr. Heseltine drove away
Two more appointments in the north today
Helpless and powerless
We join the queue for the metro bus
And Mr. Heseltine I've made up my mind
I'll never give support to you and your kind",Mr. Heseltine Meets His Public

Though they broke my legs
They gave me a crutch to walk

Their laws to guide me
And a crutch to walk
Brothers and sisters, I have sinned more than sinning,
I have been away these last four long years,
But now I am returned to the fold to be among my flock.
I come as humble shepherd embodied by the almighty, the power above, 
The power which is in me. Because I am reborn, brothers and sisters,
I am living proof that government saves. Brothers and sisters,
I want you to show our faith in the powers that be, for we are the true believers.
I want you to come forward together, come to me, and let us feel the power of the cross.
Today's lesson, stay in your homes except on Thursday,
Do not stray from the path, as our signpost says,
You can't miss it really, and we're open all day.
Now there's no need to rush, we've got plenty of pencils for everyone.
Now there're collecting tins for ordinations, check,
Credit card facilities are payable, government savings,
Stickers and badges on sale, T-shirts in small, medium,
Or large, all at competitive prices.
Put a down-payment on your place in heaven,
And buy me another four years, brothers and sisters.
Dance wherever you may be, I am the lord of the dance said she.
And if you don't dance, we have ways of making you dance.
Government be with you!

Dig down for minorities
Promise them concessions
Ride in on their backs

To an industrial heaven

Chumbawamba,"Attend you gallant Irishmen and listen for a while
I'll sing to you the praises of the sons of Erin's Isle
It's of those gallant heroes who voluntarily ran
To release two Irish shamrocks from an English prison van

[Chorus]
My lads for freedom, let's all join heart and hand
May the Lord have mercy on the boys that helped to smash the van

On the eighteenth of September, it was a dreadful year
When sorrow and excitement ran throughout all Lancashire
At a gathering of the Irish boys they volunteered each man
To release those Irish prisoners out of the prison van

[Chorus]

In Manchester one morning those heroes did agree
Their leaders, Kelly and Deasy, should have their liberty
They drank a health to Ireland and soon made up the plan
To meet the prisoners on the road and take and smash the van

[Chorus]

With courage bold those heroes went and soon the van did stop
They cleared the guards from back and front and then smashed in the top
But in blowing open of the lock, they chanced to kill a man
So three men must die on the scaffold high for smashing of the van

[Chorus]

So now kind friends I will conclude, I think it would be right
That all true-hearted Irishmen together should unite
Together should sympathize, my friends, and do the best we can
To keep the memories ever green of the boys that smashed the van

Chumbawamba,"No more chant your old rhymes about old Robin Hood
His feats I do little admire
I'll sing the achievements of General Ludd
Now the hero of Nottingham Shire
Those engines of mischief were sentenced to die
By unanimous vote of the trade
And Ludd who cannot a position defy
Was the grand executioner made
Whether guarded by soldiers along the highway
Or closely secured in a room
He shivers them up by night and by day
And nothing can soften their doom
Shall the whole team of humble no longer oppressed
And shall Ludd sheath his conquering sword
Be his grievance instantly met with redress
Than peace shall be quickly restored
Let the wise and the great lend their aid and advice
Never ere their assistance withdraw

'We come to work the land in common and to make the waste ground grow'
'This Earth divided, we will make whole'
'So it can be a common treasury for all'
'The sin of property we do disdain'
'No one has any right to buy or sell the earth for private gain'
'By theft and murder they took the land'
'Now everywhere the walls spring up at their command'
'They make the laws to chain us well'
'The clergy dazzle us with heaven or they damn us into hell'
'We will not worship the god the serve'
'The god of greed who feeds the rich whilst people starve'
'We work, we eat together, we take up swords'
'We will not bow to the masters or pay rent to the lords'

And straight to her sleeping husband
She started to stitch with a girlish thrill
With a woman's art, and a seamstress' skill
She pinned and tucked with an iron will
All around her sleeping husband

Chumbawamba,"With her friends on a road less travelled, on a journey of do's and dares
Looking back on a fear of leaving and forgetting how it felt to be scared
There are those paying fancy prices to pretend they have fancy lives
But at every charity banquet the majority stay outside
(Chorus)
We play to a packed gallery
We smile for the CCTV
We're making our own history
When fine society sits down to dine, remember that someone is pissing in the wine
Pissing in the wine, pissing in the wine
Remember that someone is pissing in the wine
She'd love to be dancing the tango and she traces the steps in her mind
You can tell by the snap of her fingers that she moves to a different time
Where all the quiet submission is smeared in lipstick red
And every act is a crime of passion
""That's not all she wrote,"" she said

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

And what to hold
If you never take the way

No one tells us what is hard

Where to fall

We are made up of our mistakes
We are falling but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

We are made of the smallest stars
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves

That you hold
If you never look away

If you push yourself then I

To stop us falling out of phase
Let's see if we can keep

You'd smile so wide i can see the stars
To stop us falling out of phase

And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real

Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'

Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you

That you would never be there for me

Has confusion taken all of your reality?

Puedo perderlo todo y que me falle el corazón 
Pero que nunca falte tu cariño ¡oh!
Contigo todo es bueno, aunque el momento sea el peor 
Baby que nunca falte tu cariño ¡oh! 

Baby dame un poco 
De tus dulces labios
Que el tiempo se hace corto 
Dámelo por favor
Vamos a escaparnos 
Con este amor de locos
Detengamos el tiempo 

Amor no te vayas
Quédate conmigo
Dame de tu luz, baby, dame tu cariño
Amor no te vayas
Quédate conmigo
Dame de tu luz, baby, dame tu cariño (Díselo Chyno)

Tú tienes lo que a mí me hace feliz 
Tú tienes lo que me enamora 
Eres perfecta para mí 
Te pienso a todas horas 

A cada segundo yo le dije a usted 
Si me toma de la mano, me siento muy bien 
Tú eres la que me relaja y me quita el estrés 
Sin ti, mi mundo estaba al revés y yo

Amor no te vayas
Quédate conmigo
Dame de tu luz, baby, dame tu cariño
Amor no te vayas
Quédate conmigo
Dame de tu luz, baby, dame tu cariño

(Los poderes, Doble U) 
Por ahí viene, déjala que nadie la frene 
Cuando ella me roza el tiempo se detiene 
El cuerpazo lo tiene, cara linda la tiene
No sale del gimnasio, ella sola se mantiene
Me enloquece, ese perfume te favorece 
Cuando me besa, me fortalece, me mira pa' que yo empiece
Parece que esta pasión crece 
Todo mi respeto usted se lo merece (Let´s go Randy)

All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is like honey it so sweet to me

But hell sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
This time
Time for us to settle down
And I
Want to be with him forever

They can say that I am crazy
For making him my baby
But that's how its gone be
See I done been trough many changes
But this one I ant changing
It gone stay the same
I can have anything in this world
But I'll sacrifice it all for him and I made
Up my mind I'm in love this
Time and it feels so real

At the same time I want you near
If you want me to leave
I will understand

What may happen boy
Although you look so good to me
It's best that I leave

Hold up wait a minute movin' too fast
I want somethin' like this here to last

Don't say no baby
Not right now baby
I want to be your lady
You got me going crazy
Well I guess I'll stay for a minute
Then I have to go boy
This moment is so temptin'
Right now it's not what I want boy
Maybe if we just embrace
With a simple kiss boy
But that'll only make things worse
Hope I'm not getting on your nerves boy
I just want it to be right for both of us
When you don't have to say a thing to make me comfortable
Boy you make me so weak when you look at me
But right now I'm a little confused I think it's best that I refuse

Supposed to be playing cards
Or watching a movie
But we keep locking eyes boy
Now why you trying ta tease me
This room is getting heated
Would you open a window
I think I should go now
Cause I can't take this no more

Bass-travelin', face-crackilin' huh?

The last time was high school
But this feeling I think he's so cute
I want to tell him so bad-but I can't
C.R.U.S.H.
Yeah I got one really bad
This is how he makes me feel

He puts the beat in my heart
Every time I see him, thoughts are getting deeper
And I knew from the start yeah, from the ""Hi"" and ""Nice to meet ya""
I was blinded by he's features.
Girls said ""You're wrong"", but I said
She said ""Ci your in love"", but I said

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness
H I thought I had it
I gotta crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush

He knows the right things to say hey
I can't help but pay attention to everything he says
He says he has fun with me
It's been a while since he could do this, tell me what does it mean?
My girls say ""you're gone"" but I said
They say ""Ci your in love"" but I say

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness
H I thought I had it
I gotta crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush

I can't control how I'm feeling inside, I'm off the meter
He's always on my mind, been a while since I felt this way
I don't know what to say, when I see him
I get the chills when I look in his eyes, he's so beautiful
He's everything and more, when I see him every day
Hoping he feels the same, am, am-he's a keeper

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable

Ciara,"I'm focused, man

You should know this, man

Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city, any town; touch down, I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby; I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationalist; you should know what I'm about
When you look at me, baby, you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before

It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them, baby, bye, fall back
He's so good, and he knows how to love me
But so hood, and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude, and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say:

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me
Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class, when they talk, we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

The more I get, the more my ambition tells there's more
I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Ya friends try to confuse, but you know what
My intentions are good; I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could; you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby, you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm ya man

I can hear your call; it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy; I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy; I just can't leave you alone

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game

I'll accept the time I know God has for me.
One day I'll be the perfect wife.

It's time to start living.
It wont always be the same,
Can't be afraid of change.
You wanna have your way,
Demand till you're satisfied
You lower your self esteem,
You gotta live your dream.
It's all about confidence,
So let them know that you can stand up.
You never try,
Learn to express you mind.
Sometimes you gotta fight,
It's your life so don't you give up.

Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Girl, go ahead and be (just like 'em)
Go run the streets (just like 'em)
Go home, missin' sleep like 'em, creep like 'em
Front wit' your friends
Act hard when you wit' 'em, like 'em
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he don't know won't break his heart (hey)

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing

What if I, had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

If I was always gone
Let the sun beat me home (Would you like that?)
I told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasn't true if I act like you
Walked a mile off in your shoes (Would you like that?)
Messing with your head again
Dose of your own medicine

What if I, had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

R-A, go, here's the clutch

If I paged you (Would you like that?)
Had friends (Would you like that?)
Never call (Would you like that?)
No, no, you wouldn't like that, no!

What if I, made you cry? Would they still apply?
What if I, if I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy",Like a Boy

Ciara,"He made it so hard
To trust someone
He made it so hard

Not trying to mess up this relationship (thinkin')
'Cause the last man did me that way
You gon do the same things I
Don't wanna be this way
But I'm hoping you can change
The way that I feel
(ooooo)you see
I trusted him with everything
Never held back anything
Thought we'd be 2gether for the rest of our lives
So suddenly he took his love away
And made it hard to trust again (oooo)

I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past
And put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[Chorus:]
When I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think about just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone
Baby I gotta let go
Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind

Whatever's yours
You call it ours send flowers
With love you keep me showered
But so did my x-man at first
You see what started out so simple
All flew out the window
There I go comparing you to him again
It keeps holding me down (i gotta let it go)
I wanna give love a chance (but you may never know)
Baby you can be the the one for me
Yes the only one for me
And I don't want to loose a good thing nooo...

One disappointment, one heart break
To many mistakes in love I've made
I can't come with all this baggage
Thinking he's gonna have it
See I know I'm being selfish
But I gotta let it go
Close that chapter, close that book
Faith in love is all it ever took
That's why I never gave up and never gave in
'Cause I know true love is waitin' for me again

I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past
And put it all on you
I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Every time I think of what he did to me
It makes it hard to fall in love
When I think I find just what I need
It makes it hard to trust someone

Don't wanna miss out on love this time
Gotta leave those things behind

To trust someone
He made it so hard

Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Girl, go ahead and be (just like 'em)
Go run the streets (just like 'em)
Go home, missin' sleep like 'em, creep like 'em
Front wit' your friends
Act hard when you wit' 'em, like 'em
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an airtight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he don't know won't break his heart (hey)

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you, but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like where you be at?
'Cause I'm out, four in the morning on the corner, rolling, doing my own thing

[Chorus]

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

If I was always gone
Let the sun beat me home (Would you like that?)
I told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasn't true if I act like you
Walked a mile off in your shoes (Would you like that?)
Messing with your head again
Dose of your own medicine

[Chorus]

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

Can't be getting mad what, you mad?
Can't handle that

R-A, go, here's the clutch

If I paged you (Would you like that?)
Had friends (Would you like that?)
Never call (Would you like that?)
No, no, you wouldn't like that, no!

What if I, made you cry? Would they still apply?
What if I, if I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy",Like a Boy [Kardinal Beats Music]
Ciara,"I'm focused man
You should know this man

Yes one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle my business
Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a great conservationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

So when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it (oh)

I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

The more I get the more my ambition tells there more
I'll move an A for that girl I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
An be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man

If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy I just can't leave you alone

[Repeat: x2]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want

I can't feel face, tryin; to focus but my mind ain't right
I remember the party, the DJ, my homies, my man and me
But the rest of it's blurry,
Something I did made my baby go away

Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do, what I say
Man I don't remember
Guess I had to much to drink
'Cause I don't remember

Aww, my car ain't outside
How the hell did I get home
Damn, did he drive me, drop me off
Got his stuff and get gone
Can't call my homies, 'cause I'm lookin'
And I just can't find my phone
I need to talk to somebody

I just don't remember

Wish I could playback, from beginning to the end
I think we started dancing, I kinda remember a kiss there
What a cute bartender
For the Remy, the Hiney, of Coke, and Gin
'Cause I'm not a drinker

When I looked into your eyes
Never walked up to a guy

I just wanna make you mine
Wanna play with you all night
So tell me what your name is

But I cant let you slip away
So tell me what your name is

Tell me though
If you got a girl at home
I gotta know
Is she taking care of you
Like I would do

'Cause you know I can't stay home
I got this thing turned up
Everybody's hands going up
I might just live in the moment
'Cause I can't get enough
We all wanna have fun sometimes
So let's do it one time for the one time
You know I be going in
Tomorrow we do it again
Can't wear high heels on this song
Might see me out here with some kicks on
Even if I get a little crazy
You know I still remain calm

Southernplayalistic through speakers in my trunk
Roll the windows down and just enjoy the ride
Even when I'm out of town they know just where I'm from
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, GA that's right
No lie

Tell me what you wanna do, tonight (what you wanna do)
Thinking about you riding down to 85
Baby we can do whatever you like

It's all good (it's all good, it's all good)
It's all good
I've been thinking bout you
It's all good
Tell me what you wanna do
It's all good
Shawty I can fall through
It's all good in my hood, yeah",All Good
Ciara,"Sweat dripping from my body, we both at this party
So come and show me your moves
I got some things I can teach you too
If you wanna see, oh oh
You say you need a shot of the Henee
Then you're ready
Do what you need to do
'Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy, oh oh

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
Let's dance like we're making love

If you're down just maybe
We dance like we're making babies
As soon as our song comes on
'Cause boy we got all night long
So if you're ready
I'm ready to get it come on
I see a little faded
You wanna get crazy out on this floor
I hope you're sure this is what you want
'Cause once I'm turned on, you can't turn me off

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

And then out through the night baby
Closer than before
Dance like no one's watching
You and I tonight
Be the time of your life baby

Ciara,"You know what I think?
You should just fly

If you have any feelings
Let 'em go, let 'em go
I woke up wasting your kiss
You can go, there's the door

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'mma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go
Let you fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go, oh

When I was at your house
I was sad, I was down
Tried to fix what we had
Didn't work, wasn't sure

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'mma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go
Let you fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go, oh

You should fly, for the first time in your own life
Just fly, let your real ambitions go
And fly, you should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, fly, fly, fly",Fly

Cibelle,"He likes sipping his tea
Slowly from the tip of the tea pot
From the tip when the pot is hot
When he's not lonely...

I'm lonely not, he has it his peers
I'm dancing around hands and
He sheds some tears
When she's not there
He's quiet he is mad man
He's quiet without she mad man

mad man
Le lourd chagrin d'un coeur fragile et fou
D'extases va t'il me rendre souple
Combler le vide, tenir le coup
Attendant une nouvelle aurore sentimentale
M'abreuve de ce liquide Ã  la couleur pale
Mes verres Ã  vin se noient dans ma verveine
S'use mon latin Ã  perdre haleine

The lady with the tea pot taking him within
He's going crazy with this long long
There walking down the street
With this flower shirt, his loneliness and his thirst for tea

Help me, I'm falling down the stair
Of my thoughts, my heart
Help, I'm slipping down
Help me

I'm slipping down, I feel my skin dry
Miles away they could be rebirth
They could become a cloud
They could be anyhow
Just a small portion of the ocean, soâ?¦

Give me something softer cautionly (?)
Give me some feathers so that I can stop it and glide
And glide up
Like a little birds and glide up

Like an eagle
With gigantic wings
Master the winds of change
Master the winds
Reborn again
Like a phoenix

So help me
Help me, I'm gonna fly
Help me
Help me, I'm gonna fly so high
Like a phoenix
Born again like a phoenix
Born again like a phoenix

I was walking down the street
I was cruising in Brooklyn
You know what I mean?
Something was cooking,
But wasn't yet a chicken.

There was a man,
Selling chicks in a box.
He said, ""two for one, but three for two.""

The other was blue.

She was noisy every night.
I had always chicken-bite.

Then I met a lover
One night, she made me dinner.
Licking finger, I wondered
Where she got the chicken.

rode three shadows of blue

Yuka Honda knows her water - ""Pass the Volvic""
No wonder her fingers are smooth like butter
It's specific. No mind traffic
CIBO MATTO 1999!
I'm Miho Hatori straight outta purgatory
Ai? Ai? Alright? I'm passing on your right
Don't be snobby with me
Not aioli, surely not Moby
Obi-Wan Kenobi told me in the lobby
Technically I'm free and I can find the key

There is a hole on Broadway, no control, it's in my way
I feel no goal. Where is my soul?
I got no reset for this game

Our name is stereotype with an A
I've got to get the shit straight. Can you relate, my mate?
Don't be late, my gate is open
Downtown still sends me up in the sky

I feel no goal. Where is my soul?
I got no reset for this game

Cibo Matto,"I'm so speechless, you saw me crying you've never known
I'm so speechless, I'll never come back to you

Did you call me? Once in a week?
All you want to do is to be like a sheik
Always catching girls like fishing for crawfish
You won't get a dish never, you're just a selfish

Please don't take me to the bayou
I'm not a freak I don't want to lose my shoes
Do you? You do? I go through your taboo you do now I'm so blue

Don't make my mouth water, don't make me want to slaughter
If you give me a dishwasher, don't clean my life with your style

I'm so speechless, I saw something I've never known
I'm so speechless, I saw something you've never shown

You want quantity. I want quality.
How can I get up to go through this tragedy
There's no remedy in my satchel.
Only some memory, I feel empty
Love is like a bubble, easily breakable
I can't take this ache for my own sake
I'm cutting the rope from your boat but something still sticks in my throat",Speechless
Cibo Matto,"She's got a living stone and rain in her hand
She doesn't have an umbrella to cover herself
She's got a living stone and pain in her mind
All I can do is sing for her and myself

I wish I can take it away to three thousand light years away
Don't be afraid, I'll be next to you",Stone
Cibo Matto,"The bomb in my heart is beating me a be	 note
Maybe my ear dirt is cheating on me, yo
'Cause missin' you on Sunday morning, I need somethin' new
It's Sunday morning
But nothing helps me
I'm just waiting for the milkman to come

I can't find it, I can't find it

Why do I feel so lonely? I don't know how to compromise
You are my one and only. What can I find 'til the moon rises?

I feel dizzy, you're so damn sleazy, I know you'll say ""I was busy""
Baby, take me out, it's been rained out so I run to the bank to get my cash
And check our savings of love out but it's closed on Sunday
What can I say? I feel blue the rain starts soaking my shoes
We're losing glue I can't find a clue, I'm knocking on the door
Somebody is dancing on the floor, then I know the score, I can't take it no more

The Knicks winnin' can't even make me high, cuttin' coupons for nothing makes me sigh

I can't find it, it's been on my mind, I've been trying to find it day and night","Sunday, Pt. 1"
