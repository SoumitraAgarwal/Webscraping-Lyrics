Doris Day,"I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvellous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I really think it's marvellous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell
Deuces to me are all aces
Life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you baby I'm oh so right.",I May Be Wrong (But I Think You're Wonderful)
Doris Day,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
'Cos it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he
Should cause you such misery and pain

I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree

'Cos it's just my luck to be in love in vain.",In Love in Vain
Doris Day,"Struttin down the street, got rhythm in your shoes
Shufflin' away the blues, Mister Tap Toe
You haven't any time to lose, Mister Tap Toe
Who's the gal you're gonna choose

New straw hat with a candy bar stripe
Sharper than an old tin-type, Mister Tap Toe
The melon on the vine is ripe, Mister Tap Toe
Who you takin out tonight 

Where did you get your fancy clothes
The pretty hand painted tie
Cigar stickin' out from under your chapeau
Who're you gonna dance with tonight, Mister Tap Toe

Give a gal a break, I gotta dress that's new
The pavement's big enough for two, Mister Tap Toe
To dance along aside of you, Mister Tap Toe
Tell me what you're gonna do 
(Watcha gonna do, Mister Tap Toe)

Mister Happy Tappy Toe (Mister Tap Toe)
I want to go along with you
I've got a shufflin' shoe
We'll dance the whole night through
I wanna go along with you",Mister Tap Toe
Doris Day,"Pillow talk, pillow talk
Another night of hearin' myself
Talk, talk, talk, talk
Wonder how it would be
To have someone to pillow talk with me
I wonder how
I wonder who

Pillow talk, pillow talk
Another night of bein' alone with pillow talk
When it's all said and done
Two heads together can be better than one
That's what they say
They always say

All I do is talk to my pillow
Talk to my pillow, talk to my pillow
All I do is talk to my pillow
Talk about the boy I'm gonna marry
Someday, somehow, somewhere, sometime

Pillow talk, pillow talk
Another night of gettin' my fill of pillow talk
My pillow and I both agree
There must be a boy, must be a pillow
Must be a pillow talkin' boy for me
I hope I'm right
I'd better be right

Oh, there must be a pillow talkin' boy for me
(We hope she's right)
(She'd better be right)
(There must be a boy)
There must be a boy
There must be a boy
There must be a boy
There must",Pillow Talk
Doris Day,"Someone like you cures everything gloomy
Turns wrong into right, brightens the night
Brings happiness to me
Makes me luckier than throwin' a seven
Takes me nearer to heaven than anyone's allowed to do
When your heart is talkin' I feel like I'm walkin'
On a cloud with someone like you

Some day I'll find someone I can boast to
Somebody to hug a bug in a rug to snuggle up close to
And whenever I do, do you know the who
Who I'll give the most to
You prey on my mind, stay till I find
Someone like you

Someone like you cures everything gloomy
Turns wrong into right, brightens the night
Brings happiness to me
Makes me luckier than throwin' a seven
Takes me nearer to heaven than any other boy could do
My pockets are burnin' to spend all I'm earnin'
On a whirl with someone like you

Some day I'll find someone I can boast to
Somebody to hug a bug in a rug to snuggle up close to
And whenever I do, do you know the who
Who I'll give the most to
You prey on my mind, stay till I find
Someone like you for me
Until I find someone like you",Someone Like You
Doris Day,"Till the end of time,
Long as stars are in the blue,
Long as there's a spring, a bird to sing,
I'll go on loving you.

Till the end of time,
Long as roses bloom in May,
My love for you will grow deeper,
With every passing day.

Till the wells run dry,
And each mountain disappears,
I'll be there for you, to care for you,
Through laughter and through tears.

So, take my heart in sweet surrender,
And tenderly say that I'm,
The one you love and live for,
Till the end of time.",Till the End of Time
Doris Day,"Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rockaway rockaway

And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
Stay

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway

And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids",Tunnel of Love
Doris Day,"You won't be satisfied until you break my heart,
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start!
I tried to shower you with love and kisses,
But all I ever get from you is,
Naggin' and braggin'
My poor heart is saggin'

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame,
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same!
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart,
Oh you won't be satisfied until you break my heart!

Doris Day,"If I give my heart to you, will you handle it with care
Will you always treat me tenderly and in every way be fair
If I give my heart to you, will you give me all your love
Will you swear that you'll be true to me
By the light that shines above
And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight

Think it over and be sure
Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all those things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad
Smile with me when I'm glad
And always be as you are with me tonight

Please don't answer 'til you do
When you promise all those things to me
Then I'll give my heart to you",If I Give My Heart to You
Doris Day,"Each time I look at you 
Is like the first time
Each time you're near me 
The thrill is new
And there is nothing 
That I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight 
Of you for

The more I see you, 
The more I want you
Somehow this feeling 
Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me 
Can only be you
My arms won't free you, 
My heart won't try",The More I See You [From Bill Rose's Diamond Horseshoe]
Doris Day,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you",When I Fall in Love [From One Minute to Zero]
Doris Day,"Can't tell you the truth
'Least I don't lie about that
Kind of comfort in you
Comes when you lie right back

Safe from such a strange point of view
To hear your own words on you

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in
Any way the wind blows in

Similar creatures we are
Chasing the pipe dream down
Love elusive so far
Keeps us divided now

Go, go on and write me love songs
So I have something to sing when your gone

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but sway?
Anyway the wind's blowin'

You are love, you are love
You are monsters and angels
Untouched, unseen

All in one, all in one
I take all that you are
'Cause you're just like me
But you move and it's hard
To stay close to a satellite

So I lose sight of you
Till you come round again
I'm watching the wind

Hey ay, hey ay, ay
Anyway the wind's blowin'

How much do you go to be gone?
You are any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down too low
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows in

Don't wanna come down
Do you know the way
To be in one place but stay?

Doris Day,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants désunis",Autumn Leaves
Doris Day,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Doris Day,"Tear a star from out the sky and the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from the rose and the rose weeps too
Take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break
My life is yours to take, so please keep the spark awake

Would you take the wings from birds so that they can't fly?
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this, your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't take your love from me

All this, your heart won't let you do
This is what I beg of you
Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me",Don't Take Your Love from Me
Doris Day,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""nighty night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be

I'm a lover, everybody loves me
Anyhow, that's how I feel
Wow, I feel just like a Pollyanna

Doris Day,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day
Doris Day,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you;
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see;

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you;

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,

Doris Day,"I see your face before me
Crowding my every dream
There is your face before me
You are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are
I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are
Always
If you could share the magic
If you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic
In all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so

Just rolling along, Just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song, just singing a song

Doris Day,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

And love and romance,

Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,

Doris Day,"I never traveled further North 
Than old Van Courtland Park
And never further South than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, 
But first let me remark
I saw it from the empire state solarium

But we've been putting nickels 
In the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, 
We can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin de-luxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant,
But at present

You're just the companion
I want at Grand Canyon
for throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block.

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in May time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time

In Winter at Christmas,
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass,
We'll take a ride around the block.

We'll keep to our promise,
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling,
Still I am willing,
Just now to walk around the block.

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok
Perhaps Vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables,
Accumulate labels,
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock,
But since we are flat in old Manhattan

Doris Day,"Every time I hear that march from ?...Lowingrin...?
I am always on the outside lookin' in
Maybe that is why I see the funny side
When I see somebody's brother take a bride
Weddings make a lot of people sa-ad
But if it isn't you they're not so bad
Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee
A lot o' shoes, a lot o' rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killing, that he's so willing
To make whoopee
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget folks
That's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee
Down through the countless ages
You'll find it everywhere
Somebody makes good wages
Somebody wants her share

She makes him strudles and bakes him pies

Was like a melodious plea
Sweet moon song
That wasn't meant for me

Why is it always reminding me of

It came gliding into my heart riding 
on a moon beam from above

Doris Day,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

I'm standing now where you made your vow
So blue for you I could cry

Leaves come tumbling down round my head
Some of them are brown some are red
Beautiful to see, but reminding me
Of a faded summer love

Weighing high above in the trees
They were so in love with the breeze
Now the autumn wind brings to them the end
Of a faded summer love

I'm like the poor leaves that swayed with the breeze
I thought that life was sweet 
You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please
Then swept me off my feet

Summer morning dew turn to frost
Leaves that once were new pay the cost
Beautiful to see but reminding me
Of a faded summer love

Things I'm learning about you

Sharing your tears and your laughter

Hoping it lasts endlessly

Doris Day,"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, ha!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face

Doris Day,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars
No hideaway, no soft guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake, I can make my most fantastic dream come true
My romance doesn't need a thing, but you",My Romance [From Jumbo]
Doris Day,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship

Then I'm flying high above

Doris Day,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live
Doris Day,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
But you remained in my heart

So tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

The leaves from the trees all dance in the breeze
And float on the ripples

Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.

Doris Day,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swinging on a Star

Introducing Henry Miller
Just as busy as a fizzy sasparilla
Ain't a showman any smarter operates the Golden Garter
When the cream of Deadwood City comes to dine
And I'm glad to say he's a very goof friend of mine
Hi Joe, say, where d'ya get them fancy clothes?
I know, off some fella's laundry line
Hi Beau, aren't you a prairie rose
Smellin' like a watermelon vine
Here's a man the sheriff watches
On his gun there's more than twenty-seven notches
On the draw there's no one faster and you're flirting with disaster
When Bill Hickok's reputation you malign
And I'm glad to say he's a very good friend of a friend of mine

Oh, my throat's as dry as a desert thistle in May
In the Golden Garter, gonna wet my whistle today
Last to the bar's a three-legged crow

And no one cares how late it gets
Not at Hernando's Hideaway. Ole!

Doris Day,"A woman's touch, a woman's touch
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much

Doris Day,"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Ev'ry tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Though goodbye means the birth of a teardrop
Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace

Doris Day,"A boy found a dream upon a distant shore
A maid with a way of whispering ""si senor.""
Each night while guitars would softly play,
The tune seemed to dance 'round the words that he'd say:

Amapola, my pretty little poppy
You're like that lovely flower so sweet and heavenly,
Since I found you, my heart is wrapped around you
And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Amapola, the pretty little poppy
Must copy it's endearing charm from you.
Amapola, Amapola, how I long to hear you say ""I love you.""

The boy left his love upon a distant shore
And sailed from the one his arms were longing for.
He vowed he'd return one sunny day,
Once more to repeat what his heart had to say",Amapola

As time came around, she came

September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies, one for every year

Taking him away from you
That was never my intention

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers, and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed

I'll play this game
His way...

As long as he needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as he needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love him right or wrong
And somehow I'll be strong
As long as he needs me

If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

I won't betray his trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true, just
As long as he needs me",As Long as He Needs Me [From Oliver!]

Like a daisy I'm awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I don't even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
I've done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I. 

He's a fool and don't I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
I'm in love and don't I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Love's the same old sad sensation,
Lately I've not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,
Put me on the blink.

I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

I'll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
He's at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heart's antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

Romance finis.
Your chance finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more.","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered [Mono Version]"

Put another nickel in the machine.

I could tell you a lot, but it's not

And I got a lot of things I like to say
So when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me,
'Til it's talked away.
Well, that's how it goes,
And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear.

Must be drowned or it soon might explode...

Most ev'ryone agrees
For what else could the ingenue
And the juvenile reprise

And so I wrote a random note
A harmony or two
And when it came to add the words
I tried describing you

A very precious love
Is what you are to me
A stairway to a star
A night in Shangri-La of ecstasy

Lanterns of gold
Lanterns of blue
Twinkle in the shadows
While I dance with you

An echo in the wind
Across the summer lake
Is saying you should know
That lanterns lose their glow
And hearts can break

Then kiss me tenderly
And give your precious love

We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends,
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here,
Time hurries by, we're here and gone;

Looking for the light of a new love,
To brighten up the night, I have you love,
And we can face the music together,
Dancing in the dark.",Dancing in the Dark
Doris Justis,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flash back warm night, almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometime you pictured me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time

If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

You said, ""go slow, I fall behind""
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting, time after time

Time after time",Time After Time
Doris Spears,"Day by day I'm falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I find that day by day you're making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
I'm yours alone, and I'm in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day",Day by Day
Doris Spears,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks
Doris Spears,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Doris Spears,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Doris Spears,"I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly

There’s somethig about you, ooh and it’s something about you

Because I meant every single word that I say
I’m just hoping you feel the way that I do

You've been thru my heart, but you always leave)

But no one feels the sinner's blow it's right before their eyes

The wicked watch their heroes with evil on their minds
While reaching out for heaven's gate, their shots ring through the night
Hellbent for thunder we are racin' with the time
But no one knows which way to go and no one knows to try

5 million reasons with 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe, we're under the gun
I believe, we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
I believe we're under the gun
We're under the gun

In the land of milk and money the devil has his spies
While workin' undercover they all keep a watchful eye
They're building up the underworld, they're rotten to the bone
And crossin' out the others, while they're sellin' out their own

5 million reasons and 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe we're under the gun
I believe we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
Oh I believe we're under the gun
We're under the gun

5 million reasons with 10 million pieces to go
Wheelers and dealers with nothin' but dreams of control
I believe we're under the gun
I believe we're under the gun
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
Sold out to madness
Prisoners of sadness
I believe we're under the gun



",Under the Gun
Doro,"We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
The crowd called out for more

The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said: ""there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see.""
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be

One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale",A Whiter Shade of Pale
Doro,"There's a flamin' hole in the society
A billion souls without destiny

Doro,"Somebody please say a prayer for me tonight
I'm feelin' lost and there's no hope in sight
Tryin' to hold on to the vision
So hard when you're down
I'd trade an ounce of hard earned wisdom just to get out

CHORUS

You'll never know, till you've been broken
With the weight of the world in your hands
Don't want to know
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody loves you when you're broken
Broken down

No money, no place to lay my head down
Nobody to drive away the tears..
And if I get my hunger again oh yeah
And if I get that feelin' again
It's all the same

CHORUS

You'll never know, till you've been broken
With the weight of the world in your hands
Don't want to know
Heart full of sorrow
Nobody loves you when you've spoken
The last kind words you know
And I don't wanna lie broken
On the ground



",Broken
Doro,"Last night your shadow
Fell upon my lonely dream
There's something in the air
I knew it wasn't real
The night was filled with love
The way it used to be
And then your hand reached out
To comfort me

Came the dawn
You were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

CHORUS

I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream, last night

The room stood still
Can feel the words you said
And I still see your image
Racin' through my head
You touched my heart
Could feel your tenderness
You seemed so real
Just when you held out your hand

Came the dawn
You were gone, gone, gone

CHORUS



",I Had Too Much to Dream
Doro,"I have lived my life my way
For tonight and for today
Just the strongest hearts, they say
Always survive

And I'm fallin' through the years
All these dreams disappear
And the night is full of tears
I'll be holding on

Now this life is etched in black
And I won't be looking back
The rain washed away the tracks
I'll never find again

I'm still reachin' for the light
I'm still usin' up the night
And you know I'll be alright
I'll be holding on

When I stand alone
I don't need no memories
All the rest are gone
I'll be holding on

I know how it is
I don't steal no memories
Of all the ones you know
I'll be holding on

And my life is made of sand
It flows right through my hand
Each day I make a stand
And I see it through

I've been reachin' for the light
I've been usin' up the night
And you know I'll be alright
I'll be holding on

When I stand alone
I don't need no memories
Of all the ones you know

Word ich Dich jemals lebend wiederseh'n

Das alles irgendwie zu Ende geht
Ich weiss nur ich will uberleben
Und werde mich niemals ergeben
Ich lieb Dich besser jeden Tag
Und hoff dass nicht auch schon alles war

Ich hange doch so sehr an diesem Leben
Alles ist gut
Ich wurde darum alles dafur geben
Ich komm nicht druber weg mitanzusehen
Wie dunkle Machte uber Leben gehn
Alles ist gut
Vielleicht word ich's ja gar nicht mehr erleben

Was ist denn schon mein kleines Menschenleben
Es sieht aus wie ein kurzer Weg
Ich hoff das er noch nicht zu Ende geht
So lieb mich besser jeden Tag
Und wenn es geht auch noch danach
Alles wird gut
Es wird schon immer irgendwie weitergehen

Ich hoffe nur ich word es uberleben

Vielleicht gibt es ja danach noch ein Leben
Alles wird gut
Vielleicht word ich dich dann ja wiedersehen

",Alles Ist Gut
Doro,"You like to play with me
You drive me wild
You hurt me really deep
And I don't know why
It seems to me that I'm a long,long way from home

I went to far on the road to nowhere
It's you and me in a living nightmare
I gave up everything just to stay
Close to your heart

You make me haul like the wind
I don't know how you got under my skin

Crying, shake it up
If I cry like you baby
Does it do it for you
Crying, am t enough
If I cry till forever
Will I ever get trough

I see the trouble
And I feel the danger
Is my heart heating for a heartless stranger

Just say a word and make me
See the things I don't understand

I'm freezing cold
And its getting colder
I'm losing hope
I can't wait no longer
If I could read your mind
I wouldn't come around here no more

You better know that I'm losing my bead
And when I go love will never come back

You gotta know' that you pushed me to far
You'll soon know how that feels
I tell you now there's only one way out
My last chance is, I'll turn it around",Cryin'

Are running away like rain
I'm trying to hold on
Even though it's in vain
Off and on
Every day we change
All and all
Love and pain remains

I wish I could exist
Without your love
I wish I wouldn't be
Dependent on
Don't lie to me
To make it all alright
When your eyes
Are telling me good-bye

Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you so
Don't go
You're all that I have
Don't go
Cause I love you more than you know
Don't go

I know the way you feel
Won't stay the same
I wish that I could rise
Above the pain

I'll make it through the rain

Don't go
Cause I love you so

Can you see the fear I'm holding back
I don't want to let it out cause this

You can't imagine what it's like
I'm getting chills
I hear your voice each time

And every time we talk
I get shivers down my spine
I can't deny
You're always on my mind

I never had this feeling, never so strong before
With every day, I want you more
I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
Oh God, I wish I would know

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart?
Is my love enough for you? Enough for you

Everywhere I go
I wish you would pass me by
I keep on waiting for you anytime

And every night I pray
You would think of me sometimes
Hope I could move your heart
Your soul, your mind

Would it really matter if I knew you better
Oh, would you know which way to go
I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
It's you or no one in this world

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart?
Is my love enough for you? Enough for you

Never had this feeling, never so strong before
With every day I want you more
No, I can't stop believing, can't stop dreaming
Oh God, I wish I would know

What can take me into your heart?
What can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart
Is my love enough for you?

Oh, what can take me into your heart?
Tell me, what can I do?
Would you help me from falling apart?
Is my love enough for you? Enough for you

'Cause you're in love again
There's nothing to hide

I take no prisoners
I have no demands

You got the best of me
I think that's alright
But don't you mess with me
You'll never survive
'Cause there's a part of you I feel
That drives me crazy

I've learned to trust myself
And nobody else
It's in the way you look at me
I can tell
You try so hard to make me feel good
Baby I don't buy it

I take no prisoners
I have no demands

Through every war
I could still survive

Now you leave me with
Nothing at all
I know I'm falling apart

It's heaven with you only knowing
It's hell without you, are you going away
To leave me here a broken soul
In the cold and screaming dark
It's heaven with you, was I dreaming
It's hell without you, were you leaving me
And all good things come to pass
Walking tall on broken glass
From my heart

Standing here in the shadows
All alone, feel it deep inside
Hanging on to forever
With you here it would be so right
Now I find myself coming apart at the seams
Hand in hand with a memory
On a road of shattered dreams

I can feel you when I'm sleeping
But I wake to find I'm dreaming
And I hope to god you need me
The way that I need you

And I know there's no tomorrow
Will I ever see the light

You said it's forever
What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

[Chorus]
You said you'd always love me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying now it's time to die
You swore you'd never leave me
Till the very last day of my life
Are you saying that you'll change
Your mind tonight

Oh I don't know
Where it started
But I know where it will end
And I pray that you'll still love me
Cause my life is in your hands

I'm lost inside without you
I hope you are as well
And I feel my soul is stranded
Alone in this living hell

You said it's forever
What did I do
Do you remember
I meant everything to you

Now I'm still waiting
Alone bore in the dark
Collecting all the pieces
Of another foolish heart

In the night when you told me you never let me go
In the night I'm still waiting for you
To hold me, you to in the night you will hold me and tell me we will go
And never let me go
And never let me go",Last Day of My Life
Doro,"I've been looking 'round and this is what I found
There's not one of us
Who wants to be somebody else
We would trade places, even trade faces
But when it comes to the heart
We wanna stay true to ourselves

There's not one of us like the rest of us
There's no two of us alike
And that will never change
All of us know it and all of us show it
But when it's down to the heart
I guess all of us are the same

All of us cry, all of us try to find someone
Whose love will last forever
All of us know, all of us are on our own
It's up to us, to make ourselves feel better
All of us so alone together

If it were not for you,
I don't know what I'd do
And I just hope we go to heaven when we're gone
I've heard it's nice up there
You just sort of walk on air
And the best part's knowing
Nobody ever has to walk alone

REPEAT CHORUS :",So Alone Together
Doro,"I remember the day we met
My heart started speeding up
When you walked in the rehearsal room
I couldn't help it, fall in love
It wasn't the way you smiled
That blew my breath away oh no
It wasn't anything you said
It was all in the way you played

Let's rock forever
Take me up to heaven with that black guitar
Let's rock together
Play me that song that'll stir my heart
Let's rock forever, on 'n' on 'n' on
Let rock forever live on

(I like the way you do it)

Hey baby I'm amplified
Let me tell you what's on my mind
Bend the strings inside my heart
Like the guys in Metallica
Knock me out with all your tricks
'cause' I'm in love with your red hot licks
Keep it goin' in overdrive
Be the power that'll keep me alive

My pain I turn into heat
Inside these flames
When time has no meanin'
Where seasons don't change
I dream with the heart of a thief
And I don't feel no shame

There's an island
In my soul
There's desire
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango
Dance demons
Don't you know
This is a metal a metal tango
This is a metal...tango

The sky is cryin'
The tears fall like rain
The wind it gave me the key
To unlock these chains

What you got in your bag of tricks?

Come take me erase me

Let's do something that's front page news
Can't stop thinking about you
Leave your innocence black and blue
Can't stop thinking about you

I can't tell you what I go through
I've been through heaven and hell for you
All night
All night long
Satin dreams all covered in sweat
When I wake, hot to the touch
I swear to god you'll be the death of me yet

You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
Oh

(Now) Here we are
Both skin to skin
Your body sacred
We're about to begin

Let it drop from the sky
Understand I might draw first blood
But I won't sting like the rattlesnake bite
One day you'll feel like I do

If I take you, understand
I might explode like a bomb in your hands

You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
Oh

So, what should I say
Is it the ancient death of lovers
Oh, is it the coming rain
Or is it the passion of something more strange, yeah

You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
You are my ceremony
Oh",Ceremony

Where I find my soul awake as I sleep
Oh my god there's rain when you're gone
What we need in ourselves
We can't find in our dreams
There's a fire storm deep inside of me
Could it be my heart desperately
If the tears I cry bring you to your knees
Could you ever feel desperately

Now the dream I had is over
Somehow I know it wasn't me
Oh my god there was ice when you ran
What I need to believe is the reason of time

Can't you listen
I hear a heartbeat
Or maybe thunder
When you're alone it all sounds the same

Have you ever been desperate
Have you ever been desperate
How I've been desperate
Have you ever been desperately",Desperately
Doro,"What a dream come trueI got the biggest crush on you
My whole body shakes
I know I'm gonna break
But God I'm craving for more
The only thing I really feel is the regret of my heart
Killing you with kindness
Like a junkie pushing all his shots

I'll take a bullet in for you
Or whatever you want me to
But don't you mistake it for love
I'll walk the razors just for you
To show you a thing or two
But don't you mistake it for love

When you come in view
I'm keeping cool but man I'm so damn hot for you
I thought it would be fun
But then again I think it's turnin' upside down, down, down

Many times I realize all the damage that is to be done
If you want to see over the edge
I already feel like a loaded gun

Chorus
So you want to play?
You want to play with fire baby?
I'll show you fire
You're lookin' right at it
Watch me burn into your bloody soul

Many times I realize all the damage that is to be done
If you want to go over the edge
I already feel like a loaded gun

Be my mirror where I'm free to let go

Tie me up and tie me down
Tie me up, tie me inside out

In something like a cage... we heat it up
Warm bleeding, soft screaming
I feel some human chain... we heat it up
Show me wicked toys and all there is
Fear no game I'm sure I will be pleased
Be my blood moving fast or slow

Do you think that I don't know
Your love for me turned cold
How sad to see you go ...But

I'm hoping that you'll fall in love again
And never look back on what might have been
I pray that we will stay the best of friends
And in my heart I hope that you will fall for me again

",Fall for Me Again
Doro,"I never got into magic, but the magic got into me.
I'd been tangled up in love, but afraid of being free.
Men... I don't understand them.
They take you for all you got
And leave you howling at the moon
And thinking of... I don't know what...
Yeah, I do. Thinking of that man.
Is he alone? Is he thinking of me?
Does he still love me?
I needed some answers. Deep answers ...
So there I was on the side of town where the beggars sleep.
It was late. Real late ...

But I knew she'd be open. Gypsies love the night.
I heard that from a friend who once knew one.

Sure enough her light was on and her door was cracked.
The smell of incense made the night air cry out in desperation.

But I didn't care. I was looking for revelation.
So I walked in and made my way through a curtain of beads.
I put some money on the table
And she reached for a deck of cards and said: ""Sit.""
She told me to look in her eyes.

I did... But I also kept my eye on that deck.
She gazed at a card and then she said ...

I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
Than to find out they can lie to you

She picked the money up from the table and stuffed it in her blouse.
I said, ""Wait a minute ... I was expecting a little bit more than that.""
She said, ""What do you want me to do? Turn myself into a cat?
I could you know. And I believed here.
Everything got deadly quiet.
Man, I was scared, but I didn't show it.
Then she broke the silence. ""Why are your palms sweating, child?""
God, this woman was good.
I asked her to read my palm. She said,
""All right, but it'll cost you another fifty,
And then I'm going to bed. Gypsies hate the night...
Gimme your hand. I'm gonna read between the lines.""

I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds, as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
Than to find he might be leaving you

She said ... I can see that you don't really want to know
What your future holds as you travel down the road
You'd rather believe that dreams do come true
So does the man who's followed you.

And in case you didn't get my letter
I ain't been making any head-line news
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you

Millions of people... I'm that much more lonely
I'm seeing you - in every single face

Without you here I feel so out of place

And if it makes you feel any better
I ain't been doing things we used to do
I just walk around and wish we were together
I'm gettin' nowhere without you

Too late to explain - why I came here
It was just something that I had to do
But take it from me - you're all I need
'Cause I'm still in love with you

How could you love me, you made such easy prey
Didn't they teach you loving is nothing but pain

A sea of blue, a place where your heart could lie
Where it could drown, where it could never survive

And some are born to fight
Everything that's right
You see 'em everywhere

Some are born to wealth
Earned by someone else
And when their moment comes
They take it and they run
Some are born to be
Lonely refugees
Their heart must weigh a ton

Children of the night
Their dreams are filled with fright
They close their eyes and
Pray to God that help is on the way
Heaven help us all
Be a guidin' light
To the children of the night

You know how it feels
Some wounds never heal
Scars of yesterday
Still won't fade away
But I believe that we
Could join our hands and be
The ones to set them free

CHORUS:

Some are born to be
Those of us who leave
Their heart must weigh a ton

And every night I pray
You would think of me sometimes
Hope I could move your heart

Would it really matter
If I knew you better
Would you know which way to go

That forever is just a lie

When my only true love died
But last night I got the feeling
There was a spirit in the air
I lit a candle and I held my breath
I swear I saw you standing there
You spoke to me in whispers
And I melted at what I heard
There were echoes from the other side
In each and every word

Said love is undying
True love never dies
We'll meet up again
â??Cause love has no end
Love is undying
I'm so glad I saw you
I shivered inside
When you closed your eyes
But love is undying

And last night I dreamed a dream of you
Where you took me to the other side
You looked so happy, not a trace of tears
And I could not help but cry
You said I wasn't ready
To tell my world goodbye
But you'd wait for me until the end of time
And forever is not a lie

True love never dies

Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
Give me your lips for just a moment and my 
Imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on",A Kiss to Build a Dream On
Dorothee Berryman,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

Dorothy Dandridge,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Yesterday, perhaps

Then I met you

How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand

When you came in sight I got that old feeling

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.",I Wish You Love
Dorothy Squires,"In my heyday 
Young men wrote to me 
Everybody seemed to have time to devote to me 
Everyone I saw all swore they knew me 
Once upon a song 
Main attraction, couldn't buy a seat 
The celebrity, celebrities were dying to meet 
I've had every accolade bestowed on me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me 
I had my share of fame 
You know my name 

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 

Always posing, but you love it all 
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all 
Everything I did the world applauded 
Once upon a star 

Framed citations, hung on every wall 
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all 
There were times I felt the world belonged to me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me 
I had my share of fame 
You know my name 

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 
But I'm not sure how 
But I'm not sure how",If I Never Sing Another Song
Dorothy Squires,"Wrong
Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this
Would it be wrong to try?

Wrong
Would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way
Under this starry sky?

If it is wrong
Then why were you sent to me
Why am I content to be
With you forever?

So
When I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong",It Can't Be Wrong
Dorothy Squires,"I would walk behind you 
on your wedding day
and I'll hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me you're still on my mind
Look over your shoulder I'm walking behind

Maybe I'll kiss again with a love that is new
That I shall wish again I was kissing you
Cos I always love you wherever you row
We could have been happy like Dabby and Joe
So if things go 

Unkind look over your shoulder I'm walking behind",I'm Walking Behind You
Dorothy Squires,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

Some times I sit back and reminence bout the times we was young
From the times we were smaller
All winters and summers
Now you ain't here wen its sunny
But you was there in the thunder
My nigga just think back 2 all them times we used 2 kick it
But now we only kick it everyother blue moon
And a lot of that is my fault
But a lot of that is yo fault
Its all good we both off
Now we don't even talk
Naw that ain't even how we get down
My nigga we need 2 sit down
Shit everytime we hit town 2 kick it
And visit so everything is everclear
My nigga I'm forever here
I don't ever wanna have to hear
You just sittin down here, jackin down here, checkin down here strugglin down here till you realize there ain't nuthin down here
And if its 1 thing you remember if nuthin else bro I got you're back
Big bro I got you're back and that a fact

And had nowhere else to go
This shyt ain't never changed (x2)

Later on now and before
And I just want you 2 kno
That I'm just happy 2 kno
I culd depend on my bro

And had nowhere else to go
I culd just pick up my fone
If sumthin ever go wrong
My nigga hit me
Till the day we 6 feet
Before the fame before the game
My nigga you was wit me
Talkin 2 all my niggas we was riddin round 6 deep
No homo but this money done came between us
My baby gurl growin up ain't you and even much seen her
Its funny the savage ways of money
And you and I both kno that niether of our mommas raised dummies
If the knew we wasn't talkin like we used 2
Or chillen like we used 2
They wuldnt like it much 'cause seein us was all they was eva used 2
4real but it don't even matter tho
'cause I kno that you kno that we kno
That we both ain't got nuthin but love 4 eachotha

Where the earth knows peace with man
When a storm hides the distant rainbow

Where friendships never end

Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird

Who come to the door
Wistful and pale of twenty and four
Delivering daisies with delicate hands

Beware of young girls
Too often they crave to cry
At a wedding and dance on a grave

She was my friend, my friend
My friend, she was invited to my house
Oh yes, she was and though she knew

My love was true and no ordinary thing
She admired my wedding ring

Oh yes, she did, oh, what a rare
And happy pair

Oh yes, I did, ah, but this lass
It came to pass

Had a dark and different plan
She admired my own sweet man
She admired my own sweet man

We were friends, oh yes, we were
And she just took him from my life
Oh yes, she did, so young and vain
She brought me pain

But I'm wise enough to say
She will leave him, one thoughtless day
She'll just leave him and go away, oh yes

Dory Previn,"He lives alone in his great big house
With collages on the walls and cathedral halls

And he eats at a table with room for eight
And each course is served on a separate place
And he sits by his pool and he waters his plants
And he does not dance, he does not dance

He lives alone in his great big house
With his Jacobean chairs and his marble stairs

And he sleeps in a room with a dozen locks
And his money is kept in a cardboard box
Underneath his bed
(With his mother's ring)
And he will not sing, he will not sing

Nothing burns in the fire place
Leather bound are the books
A silent film star lived there once
And a lady comes in and cooks
And looks after him
(Because he pays her well)

He lives alone in his great big house
And when his pulse begins to pound
At an alien sound

Then he calls in a voice that can't be heard
To a room down the hall where no woman stirred
And he thinks of her and he wishes her there
And he cannot share, he cannot share

He lives alone in his great big house
With collages on the walls and cathedral halls
And he thinks of her and he wishes her there
And he cannot share, he cannot share

Dory Previn,"I walk in, I ain't too dumb
I know I got some handicaps t'overcome
I mean y'seen one midget, y'seen 'em all
Oh yeah, midget, oh yeah, small

And that's as far as you can see
Is that the sum
And total substance of me?
Midgets dwarfs chimps in a zoo
They all look alike to you

Well listen good 'cause I don't lie
There's a whole lot more to me
Than meets the eye
And it fills my little soul with midget hate

The way that people will not learn
To differentiate, yeah, sure midget
That's what you say
And that's as far as it goes

But have you ever said
That's a Hungarian midget?
Or that's a midget
With a wart on his nose?

Have you ever taken the time to notice
A midget with curly hair
It isn't fair, there are skinny midgets
Fat midgets, gay midgets, flat midgets

There are midgets in deep despair
Half a soul half a brain, half a heart
And twice the pain, sure they're cute

And they're a lot of fun
But would you want your sister
To marry one?

Midget small, that's it and that's all
The classification it is made
Midget runt, well, now I gotta be blunt
I wish I was born

I wish I was born a spade
Sure I would still be a midget
But I would have such
Such beautiful coloration

And among my fellow midgets
I would be a sensation
Talk about standing out in the pack

I wish I was black
Midgets dwarfs chimpanzees
Ain't it all relative
When you're on your knees?

So don't tell me, don't tell me
About minorities
I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ
I was black

",Midget's Lament
Dory Previn,"I have flown to star-stained heights
On bend and battered wings
In search of mythical kings
Mythical kings

Sure that everything of worth
Is in the sky and not the earth
And I never learned to make my way
Down, down, down where the iguanas play

I have ridden comet tails
In search of magic rings to conjure
Mythical kings
Mythical kings

Singing scraps of angel-song
High is right and low is wrong
And I never taught myself to give
Down, down, down where the iguanas live

Astral walks I try to take
I sit and throw I ching aesthetic bards
And tarot cards are the cords to which I cling
Don't break my strings

(I wish you would)
Or I will fall
(I wish I could, I wish I could
I wish I could)

Curse the mind that mounts the clouds
In search of mythical kings
And only mystical things
Mystical things

Cry for the soul that will not face
The body as an equal place
And I never learned to touch for real
Or feel the things, iguanas feel
Down, down, down

Where they play
Teach me, teach me
Teach me, reach me

",Mythical Kings and Iguanas
Dory Previn,"I was riding in my car
Screaming at the night
Screaming at the dark
Screaming at fright

I wasn't doing nothing
Just drive about
Screaming at the dark
Letting it out

That's all I was doing
Just letting it out

Well, along comes a motorcycle
Very much to my surprise
I said, ""Officer, was I speeding""
I couldn't see his eyes

He said, ""No, you weren't speeding""
And he felt where his gun was hung
He said, ""Lady, you were screaming
At the top of your lung""

And you were, doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming in your car

In a twenty-mile zone
You were doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming

I said, ""I'll roll up all my windows""
Don't want to disturb the peace
I'm just a creature
Who is looking for a little release

I said
""And what's so wrong with screaming
Don't you do it at your games
When the quarterback breaks an elbow?""
When the boxer beats and maims

But you were, doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming in your car

In a twenty-mile zone
You were doing it alone
You were doing it alone
You were screaming

I said, ""Animals roar when they feel like
Why can't we do that too
Instead of screaming 'Banzai baby'
In the war, in the human zoo""

He said, ""I got to take you in now
Follow me right behind
And let's have no more screaming
Like you're out of your mind""

So he climbed aboard his cycle
And his red-eyed headlight beamed
And his motor started spinning
And his siren screamed

He was doing it alone
He was doing it alone
He was screaming on his bike

In a twenty-mile zone
He was doing it alone
He was doing it alone
He was screaming

I was doing it alone
I was doing it alone
I was screaming in my car
In a twenty-mile zone

I was doing it alone
I was doing it alone
I was screaming

We were doing it together
We were doing it together
We were screaming at the dark

In a twenty-mile zone
We were doing it together
We were doing it together
We were screaming

We were doing it together
We were doing it together alone

In a twenty-mile zone

",Twenty-Mile Zone
Dory Previn,"I tell you how I hate you in the voice my father used
You answer with your mother's worn clichés
And in another life, your father hears his wife
And I see his fury blazing in your gaze

An echo hears an echo and my mother's fist is raised
The hand I clench at you shows her distrust
The way one behaves is determined in the graves
Of all the great grandparents gone to dust

Our fathers fight through us
As they fought their father's war
And the same old scene's repeated
As before and before and before
And before and before

And when I tell you how I hate you
Before the birth of Jesus
Before the death of Caesar
Before Siddhartha
Before Ulysses
Before the Trojan war

I tell you how I hate you
And a long decaying anger
Comes alive inside a castle
And behind an ancient door

The empress of chine
Tells her lover how she hates him
She tells him once more
And once more, and once more
And once more

",The Empress of China
Dory Previn,"Mama, mama comfort me
You're the loving one
Daddy bought me electric trains
'Cause what he wanted was a son
He wanted a son

Oh mama, mama
Where's the joy in a birthday gun?
Daddy taught me how to shoot
'Cause what he wanted was a boy
He wanted a son

Oh mama, mama, don't be down
Lift your grievin' head
And tell me what you said
You got no lovin' left around

But don't you understand
Your daddy man is dead?
Am I'm alive but I can't get through
Is there anything to gain
If I get out my electric train?

If I should shoot his gun for you
Would that tend to please you
Tend to ease your pain?

Oh mama, I ain't guilty
You're not to blame
What we did is done
Sure we failed our daddy man

'Cause what he wanted was a son
To carry his name
But show you love me
Show you care

Show me, mama
And I swear I will make it up to you
In everything I do
All but one, I ain't your son

I'll always and forever be
Always and forever me
Me, me, mama
Comfort me

Dos Pueblos Jazz Choir & Combo,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Dose Hermanos,"Though you've played at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will melt your heart again
Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time you felt like you did then
There's just no percentage in remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again at last

Come with me
Leave yesterday behind
And take a giant step 
Outside your mind

You stare at me in disbelief
You say for you there's no relief
But I swear I'll prove you wrong
Don't stay here in your lonely room
Just looking back at silent gloom
That's not where you belong
Come with me 
I'll take you where the taste of life is green
And every day holds wonders to be seen",Take a Giant Step

Ca fait déjà deux semaines que j'y pense: où, quand, que faire du corps?
Je nous revois tits-pe jouant dans cette insouciance propre à notre jeune âge
Bien avant que la rue nous charme, bien avant de tomber dans l'engrenage
On s'est fait nous-mêmes nos repères (nos repères)

Combien d'embrouilles j'ai calmées chaque fois que tu douillais des mecs de la tess (hein)
Tu fumais le fric dans tes tchoins (tes tchoins)
J'ai compris que t'étais à l'Ouest le jour où j'ai appris
Que tu sniffais ta propre cess dans la raie de leurs fesses
Il fallait donc que ça cesse
J'ai décidé de mettre un terme à notre collaboration dans le business
Rien ne bouge, tu restes mon frère c'est juste qu'il n'y a plus d'affaires entre nous

Tu ne te retrouveras jamais sans-le-sou, gros

Sans compter ces faux rebeus, ces faux négros qui te montaient la tête, te bourraient le cerveau

Je veux marquer l'époque comme les grands rockeurs
Je pense à mes défunts j'ai des crampes au cœur
J'ai quoi à part les principes et de l'honneur?
Porter une kippa en soutient à des feujs
Qui souffrent moi j'y vois pas de problème
C'est pas ça qui va changer nos mœurs
Mais qui porte un boubou quand un négro meurt?
Tu captes ou t'as besoin d'un décodeur
J'viens représenter le bruit et l'odeur
J'arrive qu'à bouger le troisième doigt
Comme si j'étais atteins de problème psychomoteur
Traite la daronne et je vais te molester
Je suis lié à la rue gros j'suis connecté
J'ai grandi parmi des Messaoudi, des Coulibaly et des Konaté
Rien de plus qu'un p'tit raclo d'Orléans
Qui rêvait de pépettes et de conquête
Même si mon art est abstrait mes douleurs elles sont biens concrètes
J'fume pas mais j'te cache pas que soir-ce
J'm'allumerais bien un bon pet'
Je pense au petit Imad qui a trouvé la mort sur un compet
Fasciné par la vie des grands voyous
Le modèle de réussite le plus sulfureux qui s'offre à nous
Dans ma ville le narco-trafique c'est le se-ba
On s'est fait seul aucun grand nous a fait la sse-pa
J'suis seul type de ma team qui a pas fait de shtar
On ne cherche qu'à s'en sortir ce dès la barre du sbah
Mec du dehors qui se la joue artiste négro j'suis pas une star
Mec du dehors qui se la joue artiste rebeu j'suis pas une star
Nos darons ont fait ce qu'ils ont pu
Vous ne nous aimez pas, ça tombe bien, nous non plus
L’Afrique espère encore récupérer son dû
L'argent ne fait pas le bonheur? Oui, mon cul
J'ai plein de défauts mais je suis un ami fidèle
Donc ta daronne c'est la mienne
J'la dépose quand j'la voir venir de Lidl
Quand j'ai dalle-que dans mon frigo

J'ai besoin d'un bon plan pour me refaire gros j'suis à plat
J'ai besoin d'une nouvelle bitch, un plat d'attiéké tilapia
J'croise un frère qui sort du card-pla
Tombé pour homicide involontaire lors d'une garre-ba
J'ai l'impression que le frère à perdu la tate-pa
J'crois qu'ils l'ont piqué puis cachetonné les tard-ba
Je pense à sa mère qui a du faire le tour de France des parlus
Aux frères qui rentrent de perm' avec du shit coffré dans l'cavu
Aux ex-poukis qui esquivent la hagra
En faisant shab les barbus
Aux raclos avec qui j'ai grandi aujourd'hui on se parle plus
Depuis que j'ai 19 piges je vis seul
Quand je suis submergé par les blémes-pro
Je réponds plus au phone je m'isole
Pas de place pour une pute qui michtonne
Ni pour un faux re-frè qui mitonne
Certains mon déçu, m'ont mis le seum
Mais j'ai le mental de 10 hommes
Et j'crois qu'j'dois tenir ça de mon ron-da
Même quand tout est grave rien est grave
Tant que je respire c'est que tout va bien
J'suis vrai, loyal, humble et brave
Vivre sous le seuil de pauvreté
Je sais ce que c'est je me suis jamais plaint
Les harcèlements de ces bâtards d’huissiers
Ouais, j'sais ce que c'est, j'en ai vécu plein
Mais je me suis jamais plaint

Plus jamais les huissier, plus jamais les huissiers, plus jamais les huissiers

Lui laisser que son pieu

So weak and overcome
So tired of running still
The winter

I look into your eyes
An orchid without sun
Some things you can't disguise
So many people so lonely inside

Waiting
And if all this brings you down
I will be coming round

When useless dreaming comes to an end
Who will carry all your fears?

When all the tears from fury have passed
Maybe love has just begun

Like a faded photograph
A child caught in a storm
Though we will never see
The winter

There's lipstick on the glass
The questions left unasked
Two fools who've left the game
Finding themselves without solace again

Waiting
And if all this brings you down

When useless dreaming comes to an end
Who will carry all your fears?

Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"
Dottie Clarke,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song
Dottie Clarke,"Well I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hallelujah",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas/Deck the Halls
