Sparta,"It wakes me up and shakes my bones
It makes me miss my friends
You wated days, I hung my head
I wore these blinders
So I'll hide from you

You can hear the sound
When walls break down
You  wasted my days
Building on shaky ground
You can't carry on
When walls break down
Such wasted days
Building on shaky ground

Sitting face-to-face, tides will rise
Our light is in your eyes
We will be heard, our voice is strong
You shamed yourself
And we're done with you

This is your life you led
This is my life you bled

These tides sweep us out of reach",While Oceana Sleeps
Sparta,"All that you say is complementary
Within these walls, where lies
Are on display

If you hide the truth, then rest assured
There's nothing left to say,
There's nothing left to do

The difference between finding
What you love,
And loving what you found
Is killing us right now
It'll always be true, living as one
Beats dying as two
We both know this can't go on

Crawl back in place
I promise not to chase
I guess this time
I loved what I could taste
What the years have lost, is
What I've gained
There's nothing left to give
After everything I gave

Crawl back in place
I'm trying not to hate
I guess this time
I'll watch you fade away

Sparx,"Me dicen el asesino por hay 
Y dicen me anda buscando la ley 
Porque mate de manera ilegal 
La que burlo mi querer 

En un momento de celos mate 
Segado de sentimiento y dolor 
La que burlaba mi honra y mi ser 
Mi vida y mi corazon 

Ya esta en el cielo juzgada de dios 
Si allá de lo alto si a caso me ve 
Sabrá la ingrata que tuve razón sabrá cuanto la adore 

Veinte anos que de sentencia me den 
Con gusto voy mi delito a pagar 
Pero antes quiero vengarme también 
De el que me hizo criminal 
Va la justicia buscando a mi mas no me 
Entrego hasta ver a ocasión de ver a el otro que me hizo infeliz
Y abrirle su corazon

Speaker Junkies,"I'm alone
sitting with my empty glass
my four walls
follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
and you were waiting there
swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
riding on the Metro

You wore white
smiling as you took my hand
so removed
we spoke of wintertime in France
minutes passed with shallow words
years have passed and still the hurt
I can see you now
smiling as I pulled away

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
riding on the Metro

I remember a feeling coming over me
the soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
riding on the Metro

Spear of Destiny,"All those nights when you can't hold on
Needing someone there, someone
Shooting star you'd half a life
That's why you burnt so bright
Now you don't need anyone

As a kid you lived the dream
Fitted right inside it's scheme
Through a thousand love affairs
They still deny that they cared
You're gone because they got scared
I'm so in love with you

Did your world collapse one day
Nothing left to give away
Spending hours on the phone
Don't hang up I'm on my own
I can't face it when you go
I'm so in love with you

There's an ambulance outside
Reporters hang around like flies
Waiting for a photograph
When you died you weren't alone
I guess the truth will never be known

Spearhead,"I need a reason to get up /before I wash my face
The junkies, the Hookers, the dealers the place
kickin' off my covers / trippin' off the fact
that I haven't called my gramma in a long, long time
standin in the shower/ for almost half an hour
Tryin' to wake up/ and I'm lookin for the power
reachin' for the towel/ with soap in my eyes
dryin' off my shoulders,/ my chest, and my thighs
The next thing I know/ the telephone rings
I hear my own voice /on the answering machine
please leave a message/ I'm glad ya called
I listen for a voice /but there's nothin' at all
Man oh Man
I gotta kick the blues 
and pay respect where respect is due
all praises to GOD the one I return to 
the one I can turn to
when I'm feelin burned to the bone

Early in the morn/ before I wash my face
The bed is still warm but there's an empty space 
Early in the morn/ before I wash my face 
a hundred thousand miles is a lonely place

At six in the morning /she rolled outa bed 
stared out the window/ and then she said
that I wasn't her type...
I think she's runnin outta types though...and I told her so.
She picked up her things and walked through the door 
and then said that she couldn't see me no more
just as she was leaving /I asked her if she'd call
she didn't look back / said nuttin at all
I didn't change my clothes/ because they smell like you
and when I took a shower it reminded me of you
I called Gramma Brown/for advice 
it happened to me once/it happened to me twice
Michael/ my son/ you sound really bugged 
I wish that you were here /so I could to you give
a hug then she gave me/ a long, long talk
she said ""you have the patience /of ice on a sidewalk""
when things get rough/ don't sweat it
sometimes in life you just have to let it
and sing out a song / so strong
that even a bad dream couldn't bring harm
to the mind of a young childs battles 
formed from the candle light shadows
her voice is like a whispering kiss on the forehead

Early in the morn/ before I wash my face

Early in the mornin/beforeIwashmy face

In the last thirty minutes/before I fall asleep
when I have said my prayers /and I have brushed my teeth
This is the time /when I am forced to think about 
all of the things/ I been tryin to forget about
The Bills, the phone, cleanin up my room
the cars, the traffic, the speakers and the boom
alone I remember /the times with me and you
and I realize my heart is shakin' up the room
Gramma she would tell us /about the glory days
and gramma she would tell us/ about when we were slaves 
in the livin' room/ pianos outa tune
on top of it the pictures /of every bride and groom 
child/ grand child /lost child
every single tear shed / every single smile
'cause everybodies got/ a lot of shit to deal with
and life doesn't stop/ it just makes ya feel it
so shake the dust/ offa your feet
take a step forward/ liberate with the beat
so for you/ I wrote this song 
I wanted you to hear it/ before you are gone.

to me some believe there are and some believe there
ain't if ever there was one my gramma Brown she is a saint

Spearhead,"Memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella
memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella

Well it was not -that he was particularly 
suicidal he just didn't care wether he lived or died though 
it was just a matter of time
you got yours and I got mine
when he turned sixteen 
they said he could drive
when he turned eighteen they said he could die
when he turned twenty one he could buy rum 
but no one ever taught him
how things were done
then an angel appeared inside his head
she said boy do you think 
you're realty better off dead 
he don't know he just shook his heed

(chorus)
'Cause he thought the day that he died 
would be a normal day for the people on the other side
He thought that the day that he died
would be a normal day for the people on the other side
but memories come down and me once again
caught without an umbrella

But time was a matter of velocity 
in this age of information and technology 
he would cry in the shower
put his face in a towel hot from the dryer
then he sat down and wrote a note to his mom
when all is said and done
can I still be your son 
because manhood is so elusive
and respect is so exclusive 
and I got a daddy to prove it 
I think I'll never get to shake it and move
then he tied a rope around his neck 
looked in the mirror and said what the heck 
I'm gonna bring the whole roof down with me 
and then he jumped

(chorus) 

""Come in Vernon'

But halt way down 
he heard what the angel said
and he realized -he really didn't want to be dead
he landed with a thump- his head was reeling
layin in a lump- looked up at the ceiling 
and saw that the rope... had broke
well he failed at the only thing
that he thought he couldn't fail at 
that was takin' his own life
and he said"" I kinda like livin'
he could feel his heart makin a boom
sounded like music in the next room
music in the next room 
he said ""it's time for a celebration"" 
felt his hands looked at his face 
lifted the rope off his throat, ""I ain't such a disgrace."" 
he said manhood is so elusive and respect is so exclusive
and I gotta daddy to prove, that some people never get to
shake it and move.

And He knew that the day that he tried
was not a normal day for the people

and shove it in my arm
whenever I feel life is 
comin' on too strong

the tracks in my arm said
it all depends which side the tracks your on.
tellin' me what to wear 
tellin me cut my hair
and tryin to convince me that they
really really care
all about my health and about my wealth
but still they built the Stealth

other on the back as a matter of fact 
sister Asatta Shakur and Geronimo Pratt
'cause Amnesty international

you know it's much more critical than that
percentages black is really, really whack
can I kick a few facts yes?

Sx percent in college
from livin on the block
twenty five percent in prison
the school of hard knocks 
fifty percent in poverty
is livin on the rocks
five hundred brothas on a death row box

The punishment is capital 
for those who lack in capital
because a public defender 
can't remember the last time 
that a brother wasn't treated like an animal.

They say they blame it on a song 
when someone kills a cop
what music did they listen to
when they bombed Iraq? 
give me one example so I can take a sample
no need to play it backwards 
if you want to hear the devil
cause music's not the problem 
it didn't cause the bombin'
but maybe they should listen 
to the songs of people starving..

I tuned in because I was hella psyched

'Cause in the same year / we saw Rodney King

will he find a dealer and try to place an order?
what's gonna happen if I give the man a nickel
will he buy some food or some pork that's been pickled? 
I'm not responsible for the man's depression
how can I find compassion in the midst of recession?
How come all these questions keep fuckin' with my head
and I still can't rememba why I need a spool of thread.

(chorus)

He's starin' in my eyes just as I'm walkin' past
I'm tryin to avoid him cause I know he's gonna ask 
me about the coinage that is in my pocket
But I don't know if I should put it in his bucket
walk right past him to think about it more 
back at the crib I'm openin' up the door
a pocketful of change it don't mean a lot to me
my cup is half full but his is empty 
I put back on my cap and I start headin' back
I reach into my pocket and I have a heart attack
well as I'm diggin' deep I scream ""oh no!"" 
there's nothin' in the pocket but a great big hole
While I was busy thinkin' if he would buy smack
the jingle in my pocket it slipped through the cracks 
no one has the change and it's fuckin' up my head
But now I no the reason why I had to buy the thread!

make everything alright for you.

Spearhead,"Say when you called me that night
to tell me that things
they weren't goin' alright with your boyfriend
was it me or did you just need somebody to talk to
Say is it you or the fact that I can't be near you
that keeps you in the front of my mind
when your breath is the last thing that you say
when your voice goes away                      
and a breath is the last thing that you say

But the warmth of your lips on my fingertips won't go away
when I drop my head in my hands and play
the memory of that might in L.A.
again and again and again
because I can't think straight and I can't sleep late
the few times we shared I try to recreate
I know this is wrong better stop this talk
cause grass can grow up through a crack in the sidewalk
and what I see when I look in your eyes
grass that's truly greenest sprouting inside
I wasn't even looking when I realized
that you had the vibe that was my fertilizer
thought love in this world was dead and buried and gone
how could I be so cynical when I was so young
you hit me in the chest like and 808 boom
I found love is the shit that makes life bloom!

(chorus)

Love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might step in it!
love is the shit that makes life bloom
and you never know when you might...

But fate is like a pigeon that follows me around
sometimes he flies ahead and he brings me what he found
then he'll drop it on my head leave me numb
from the brain down
that's the way it was when I walked upon your ground

The irrepressible and impermissable
are the two things that have made my life miserable
'cause spirits don't leave if you don't talk about 'em
and memories come back when you don't think aabout 'em
I wish I had an ocean of some magic potion
I'd trade all this emotion for a few moments of motion
I've never felt this way some things can't be rehearsed
now I'm grindin' up my gearbox tryin' to find reverse
because...

(chorus)

(bridge)
But I want to keep on walkin'
Right through
And let this fellin' rock me
ooh-oooh!
(repeat)
""ya know fallin' in love is like easing into a hot tub.
it feels good on your feet but by the time you
get to your mid section you know your either
gonna get all the way in or all the way out!""

But music brings me comfort in this grieving hour
the Sade tape tells me it's all over for now
I listen read hard but don't dare play it loud
'cause I don't want to think what you might be doin' now
sometimes it feels like a bad initiation but you
woke my hear from a long hibernation
you were worth every risk so I gave my hear room
and now I'm deep in the doo-doo
that makes life bloom
because...

see the bees zoomin' in the sunshine

""Really? Uh oh!""

Lose your mind misplace your mind
Forgot you even had a mind
'Cause someone told you it's impossible
To change your mind
A friend of mine made it to twenty-five
We had a celebration ""man I'm glad that you're alive""
I'm happy to see my man you're beatin' the odds
And for this on this day we give thanks to the gods
'Cause everyone deserves a shot except you only get one
I hope it's not through the head my son.
'Cause life is short when you're afraid to die.
Life is hard when you're afraid to cry.
But when I feel alone I sing myself a song
Because wherever I lay a groove is my home.

But can you see me in the desert?
Of course you can!
Can you see me on the mountain?
Of course you can!
Can you see me in the ocean?

The federal Government doesn't want me
To go to school

And I don't play by their rules. 
In school they tried to tall me
That a rock is not alive
But I have seen a volcano growin' up and die 
In school they tried to tell me
That a tree it couldn't feel
But I have felt a tree and it was bleeding for real
In school they tried to tell
Me animals couldn't talk
But they can understand it when a dog starts to bark
In school they tried to tell me

""whet happened to his"" I say ""cause mine is 
Still whole!""

The reoccuring scream of a world and it's residents
The reoccuring theme of a mind full of finger prints
The reoccuring dream of a knife and a president
Well would you like to look at Madonna's book on sex?
Or would you rather Alex Haley's book on Malcolm X?
Their fuckin' with Ice T but they don't even care if
Eric Clapton's singin' I Shot the Sherriff! 
But how many more books on this subject can I read
And how many more frustrations must I try to ease
End how many more days of this bad air can I breathe
And how many more of my friends must just die and leave

But you can't diffuse the ticking time bomb
You can't refuse the time it has come
You can't erase our people from the nation
I'll take a life before they call us ""the lost generation""

because within its pages there is something for us all
and I am not professional but I love basketball
the squeaking of the sneakers they echo in the hall

I might throw out a curve ball but I never throw a lob
people criticize me but I know it's not the end
I try to kick the truth not just to make friends

Got the guitar strummin'

on and on and on

I am not a jerk although sometimes I act like one
and I am deadly serious about us havin' fun
well I go many places but I know I'm not with you
and I am not a sucker even though I'm stuck on you

Every million miles ya haffe tek a first step

I was sick of flippin' channels / and sick of 
flippin' quarters
I called my man Zulu/ said, ""Meet me on the corner""
Maybe we can check out the clubs in the city
'cause waitin' at the crib can make you feel shitty
so he hopped into my ride on the squeaky door side and
we hit the Upper Room/ where they keep the funk alive
The man at the door/ invited us inside
He said there isn't any cover/ if you're keepin' up the vibe

We took it upstairs to big up the area
the people in the house was shakin' up their derrier
Raisin up their hands and raisin up their voices
Tokes was the D.J. I was happy with his choices
maxin' and mixin' the beats they was fixin'
my brain like a smoke that was doubly, triply, dope
the decadence is gone and lifemay never be the same
'cause when the beat hits
you feel no pain!

so a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
a piece of peace for every peaceful person that you see
a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
but I don't act peaceful if you're not that way to me
Every million mile ya haffe tek a first step
Every million mile ya haffe tek a first step

Five-O was outside waitin' with their vans
hopin' that shit would get outta hand
so dat they could test their weapons 
on innocent civilians,
the high tech shit costin' million and millions
money should've spent on something for community
but that's O.K. because we got the unity
so fuck the police! we can keep the peace!
we can make love and conquer that disease
because nothing in the world is impossible tome
I can swim on dry land and run upon the sea
and nothing in the world is impossible to me
you can chop off my legs and I'll land upon my feet
I turn it over to the spirit and I leave her in charge
my favorite record sounds like an African Head Charge
She'll beat up the beats with and eggbeater
pour em in the batter
she'll make 'em sound fatter and fatter
'cause food for the soul is the flavor of the music
spice for the brain is the essence of the lyrics
songs can be delicious and also be nutritious
You can't payfor culture"", it can only be experienced
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
""WELL HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED!""
""WELL""

then we call it punctual
we're matchin up the footsteps

and all the movers movin'
Cuba, Twist, Reminisce and NME
Graffiti on the street for everyone to see
even the elders in the house was havin' fun
because we livin' life at the top of our lungs
It was truly a life celebration that night
had the world's greatest time
but we'd never sell the movie rights
to Morrie Povich, or anyone like that
and anyone who does is really, really whack!

and if you comin' late then you might've missed some a this

til I'm wet, til I'm dry
but then wipe this tear from my eye
haven't felt this warm in a long time
even out in the bright sunshine
in lifetime of springtimes

I fall into your arms
with my heart pumpin' on
like a bubblin' dub track
like a garlicy hot tonque and lip smack

I did some contemplation
before we got down to this consecration
maybe baby something in you kiss said
it was an impetous 
for me to rethink this

If I love you
then I better get tested
make sure we're protected

I  walk through the park
dressed like a question mark
Hark!
I hear my memory bark
in the back of my brain,
makn' me insane...
...like cocaine

But how'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?
Is it gonna be a negative?
How'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?
Is it gonna be a negative?
but how'm I gonna live my life if I'm positive?

It dawned on me, it seemed to me
this is unusual scenery
this red light greenery
make me feel kinda dreamery
thinkin' how I used to be

Arrive at the clinic
walk through the front door
take a nervous number
then I think about it more
about all the time
that I neglected
makin sure that
I was protected

They took my blood 
With an anonymous number
two weeks waitin' wonderin'

I shoulda done this a long time ago
a lot of excuses why I couldn't go
I know these things and these things I must know
'cause it's better to know than to not know!

(chorus)

I go home to kick it
in my apartment
I try to give myself
a risk assessment
the wait is what can really annoy ya
everyday is more paranoya

I'm readin' about how it's transmitted
some behavior I must admit it
who I slept with, who they slept with,
who they, who they, who they slept with

I think about life and immortality
what's the first thing I do if I'm H.I.V
have a cry and tell my mother
get on the phone and call my past lovers
I never thought about infectin' anotha
all the times that I said ""Hmmm? Don't bother.""

Was it really all that magic?
The times I didn't use a prophalactic

Would my whole life have to change?
or would my whole life remain the same?
sometimes it makes me want to shout!
all these things too hard to think about
a day to laugh, a day to cry
a day to live and a day to die
'til I find out, I may wonder
but I'm not gonna live my life six feet under

but cold medication/ should not be taken nightly
because everything dat I put in/ it comes out again
and if I eat lean/ it helps me stay thin 
check out my hair, I keep it dreaded
about my corn? I like it breaded 
hot from the oven? MMMM! you said it!
straight to the stomach my fuel is unleaded

Most people on the planet/ eat beans and rice
some can't afford beef or they think cows are nice 
If you talk table manners don't believe all they
told ya I eat with my fingers like an African soldier
I don't know which fork is for meat or for salad
I haven't got a clue when they say ""whet your palate""
eat a lot a prunes it'll keep you loose
skin'll turn orange if you drink carrot juice
I think beef jerky tastes like a boot
when I'm on the street I chew a licorice root
and if I have a soar throat /then I eat ginger
and I will break bread /with those who are strangers
so come into my cave / tonight I will show you
food is for life / and life I will show you. 
If you're havin' problems/ I invite you here 
step into my kitchen /we will cook away your fears

it makes me dizzy/ I fix him fizzies

I like spicy chicken/ and I can throw it down
chilis come red /and chilis come green 
when it's on the table/ I lick my plate clean
Then I drink a toast to the host and hostess
But first we give thanks/ to God the Mostest
'cause if I am a guest/ I always wash my plate
sip a sip a soda while I sing Amazing Grace

string em all togetha like they was sneakers 
and say a prayer- before we turn it on 
hopin that the amp- wouldn't get blown.

(you remind me of my herb you keep me lifted!)
keep me lifted!

I'm the dread lock producer
some call me medusa
salaams and shaloms introduce ya
a rooster waking up the whole coopsta
spearheaded man him nice haffe move ya
sshh... understand why we sweatin'
makin' love in the wake of Armageddon
forgettin' - Babylon need a lesson
drop the tech and use my tongue as a weapon
listen - I come to lubricate the friction
sound system purrin' with my diction
Frantz Fanon the Wretched of the Earth home
Phenomenon be goin' on and on
sailing along a likkle song
by the record take it home and fling it on

(Chorus)

Hey yo I am the glory-fied of the story
child of a high crime rate category
they explore connect me to an I.Q. test
like a rat in a cage I'm trapped with the rest projects
but now I make my life go flip
like Malcolm comin' out the pen and shit
upliftment from a triffin' scene
to make a blind man murder for the things he seen
to believe is different than the daily bear witness
the spots filled up with the cocaine business
bullets trigger be pulled by the beast
kids paralyzed from his neck to his feet layin' way low
smokin' more and more...
seein' shapes in the chipped paint of my frame window
with slow visions of me livin' in the future
with forty, forty acres, acres and a land cruiser

(Chorus)

Alpha-betical ABCD's come gettable
the brown brotha with the tone unforgettable
it's edible, every word be gourmet-able
Mecca Lekka shake ya hiney ho incredible
really though ya gettin' sick it when ya hear it so
I'm bringin' with it biorhytmical medical
Anti- always dope my biotic
Macrobiotic organic Narcotic
the hemp is Kemp, like Kemp on hemp
Super like sonics keep it real like rent so
ti tac toe me say all in a row
donkey want water me say ""hold him Joe""
my stereo killed the video star just like Arsenio Hall
so tall like the rain I never back fall
young lifted and black y'all

Wake up in the morn unlock the store pops
hookers on Leavenworth closin' up shops
cops, lookin' like a blind Cyclops 'cause
they clockin' ten percent
of the CREAM off the top
got mad money comin' down the pipe
from the three piece suit who gotta piece last night
the butcher the backer phony credit card maker
plus the operation being sponsored by Jamaica

broadcast vast audio radiance, enhance
wave hands, shake pants as I commence

I get reactions just like Johnny Cochran
when he compared Mark Fuhrman to that old German
listen Herman Munster was a gangsta
S.F.P.D. shield on his clothes gave up the answer
to the crack freak just released from the jail
twenty in his pocket waitin' to inhale
takes deep breath from the piss stinkin' air
past the drag queen wearin' other people's hair
she snaps, ""What you think you lookin' at here you look
like Jimmy Walker wearin' Biggy Small's gear
Get the fuck away before I make you disappear
I don't play that freaky shit do I make myself clear.""

At 21 the brother ""Smooth"" he got a record deal
been working hard been writin' songs about the things he feels
he says it's real, 'cause I got bills, but I got skills
my deck is stacked, if I could only get my shit on wax
when it was ripe he took his tape up to the rec execs
they smoked cigars and rolled their eye's at him behind their specs
your shit is phat but I don't hear it in the format Jack
what's all this black crap check page twenty one of your contract

(Chorus)

A friend of mine Roberta she got a job at the post office
she was college edjamacated but got fired up at the law office
I'm all alone two kids at home, I need a job just any job
so I can get back on my feet like Tina ""T""(urner)
the boss came up to her said, ""why don't you come home with me""
I'd like to see you take off your clothes for me
she said ""No way man!""
he said ""You don't understand""
""You lose your life, you lose your job if you don't do this shift!""

I met a black man who became a police officer
officer, officer, officer, officer, officer, overseer
he tried to tell me it was the only job available
either rob or join the mob 'cause I'm not salable
one night he went out on an undercover sting-ing
bought some smack tried to break the heroin ring-ring
Two cops white cops saw juggling goin' down
they spilled his brain like homey the fuckin' clown
(He's gone!)
Mama Mama Mama Mama I couldn't say no
got sick and tired of seein' people bein' treated ill
picked up my nines, walked up from behind
tapped two of them on the neck so I could meet their eyes direct

Spearhead,"Do you remember all those days
the way that you loved me in all those subtle ways
I can remember before you were gone
how when we heard our favorite song
on the radio you'd smile at me and sing along

(Chorus)
but you can't sing our song for no other lover
but you can't sing our song for no other love

You and me would go dancin' after dark
long hot kisses and summer wishes in the park 
New York detail the car 
I never show up  dirty on colored 
people's time I'd pick you up 11:30 late night
we'd roll my hooptie down the boulevard
bumpin' bass and rolling low like we was superstars
killing me softly with the way you whisper in my ear
come here my dear 
they're playing songs from back in yesteryear
the slow Jammer the night programmer
the time to get undressed and where pajama slammer the car antenna...
picks up songs that belongs to us like birds of feather
like heatwave on scratchy forty five always forever

(Chorus)

I was blind to blind to see I took 
for granted the dope shit that you did for me I mistook
all your lovin' for captivity
like Ghetto boys I think my mind was playing tricks on me
I always wanted to let you know like Aretha Franklin 
you sing just like the queen of soul
too many secrets in my heart I couldn't let it show
know I still want you and I'm sad 
we had to let it go...

Spearhead,"When girls dressed in black they all look so lonely
And contraceptives don't get used by the horny
You can't find the key to the door in your building
But are you still willing
The responsibility becomes an afterthought
When one remembers the things that they should've bought
There's no pretending that you forgot
Must everything in life have political ramifications
Even taking kids on vacation or having a simple operation
But my friend Billy told me that sometimes
It takes a grown man a long time to learn
Just what it takes a child a night to learn
And my son proved his words

[Chorus]
Water pistol man full of ammunition
Squirtin' at fires on a worldwide mission
But did you ever think to stop to squirt
The flowers in your own backyard

For all my faux pa's I never said excuse me
Was the simplest things that always confused me
I never stopped I never looked both ways
Must it always a tug of love between friends and work
Hope to learn the meaning of the word jerk
Before it happens to a rope round my neck
Let's build a bigger telescope
So that we can see things more up close 
Farther away from where we really are
I was up the whole night before
Reading books about places I'll probably never go 
And those aren't good things to know about

(Chorus)
When I feel with my heart, I know in my mind 
I should say with my lips
But don't does that make you feel upset?
I should know that the power of one man seems like a small squirt
When he aims at the flames of the whole earth
But the fire starts at home...

Travelin through this world of woe
Ther's no sickness toll nor sorrow
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm goin' there no more to roam
I'm just a goin' over Jordan
I'm just a goin' over home

Ya see I'm a concrete buffalo soldier
I gotta chip it's like boulder in my shoulder
Look in my eyes and you can see a red marble
Like Nostradamus I'm the promise of tomorrow
Traveling the city with my Mexican cargo
Cotton mouth, I take a dry swallow
To the nearest corner watering hole
The bartender with the deed for my soul
Satisfaction no I can't get no
Lotsa bad habits that I need to control
Recite the psalms but no emancipation
Church for food and liquor stores for salvation
Some day I'll make
It home to see my father
He saw the man who shot the coal mine's daughter
And if I had a dime for every gamble I risked
I could buy a diamond for the woman I miss ya see

I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Ya check with me ya checking in with the danger
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Roaming the streets seeking Jesus in a manger

I'm goin' there to see my mother
She said she'll meet me when I come
I'm just a goin' over Jordan I'm just a goin' over home
Jordan river roll river Jordan roll river Jordan roll on

Gee ain't it funny - how time slips away I wanna
Rewind the tape to see my life replay
I soak up the sun, just as a reminder
That I was born a sick side winder
Call me a vagrant, no machine to read your fax
I'll never pledge allegiance to your blood sweat and taxes
Don't ever mistake me being docile for contentment
Don't ever mistake my anger for resentment

It's just the calm before the storm that's why I'm quite
Ya always mistaking an upraising for a race riot
You can take my life, but there's no escape
'cause you can't shoot yer way through the pearly gates
So swing low sweet cadillac
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low pink Cadillac
Stepping over Jordan I roam

Ya see
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Ya check with me ya checking in with danger
I'm just a poor wayfarin' stranger
Roaming the streets seeking Jesus in a manger

I'm goin' there to see my father
I'm goin' there no more to roam
I'm just a goin' over Jordan
I'm just a goin' over home

When the road is callin' yonder
When the road is callin' yonder
When the road is callin'
When the road is callin' yonder

Spearhead,"I say my prayers every morning just like orange juice
I crack the crinkles out my body till I'm feeling loose
I strap my sneakers on my feet like they was combat boots
they fit my feet like Cinderella when I'm shooting hoops
Why oh why do memories keep chasing me 
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
sometimes I want to blow my brains to put my life at ease
but I ain't clocking out I gotta see the seven seas
please seven's a very lucky number for me
that was the age when I discovered how good balling could be
up every morning with the birdies doing little drills
go to my left go to my right developing mad skills 
how could a love for this game bring so much sadness
I played with brothas with so much badness
but now they gone I sing a song pop a three
from the top of the key in they memory

(Chorus)
Why oh Why do memories be chasing me
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
even in seasons when it's another color sport
I still be memorizing lines out on the basketball court singing
Why oh Why do memories be chasing me
sometimes it makes me want to grab my shit and flee
even in seasons when it's another color sport
I be remembering my partners on the basketball court

Do you remember runnin' the court in September
me and my homies be down for whoever
would come along and try to send us to the showers
from the game that we'd been dominating' there for hours
all day to be more specific east to west
from Atlantic to Pacific fools would come round
to get down and try to take our crown
but we would hold our ground and we would never back down
old timers new timers would get in line there
and take a seat there and try to prepare
but oh no! there was no chance when we was in the zone
we was alone at the top we had hops we got props
and when we needed to we busted chops
wipe the court with your game like we was using mops
what ever happened to the super hoopers in the park
I reminisce while shootin' solitary after dark    

(Chorus)

Brother see came fresh from out of town
and he had handles and like McDonald's he could clown ya
dribbling baby bounces between drinking forty ounces
knock ya on your heels and do circles like he was Curly Neal
but oh no, the liquor got quicker to his head and he said 
""I think I musta placed some stupid bets""
he hit me up for some cash
there was a car crash a splash and then the brother made a mad dash
Rob oh Rob his whole life was like a roller coaster
but on the court he looked like a Dr. J poster
flying high with an Afro blowing in the wind
wiping Windex, index finger rolls off the glass
then swish through the net jump a Corvette with a triple pirouette
but off the court he had a few temptations copulations 
no moderations by 24 he had 3 pregnations
last check crack intoxications
so many other brothers gone from this dimension
and none of those who got hurt receive a pension
give a Bup! Bup! to those locked up in detention
memories too many dimension 
and we say, one more time... one more time

The main attraction DJ Ak-Shun for your pleasure or your leisure
Try to match the scratch and you will end up in a seizure
Strain upon your brain, you can't contain the plain fact
That if you tried to cut this hard I bet your record would crack
Or either break, what does it take to make your hair-do
I have to put a speaker to your ear for you
To say, ""Hey, I like the way the deejay is playin""
Cause that's what you'll be sayin
You'll say, ""I want a deejay just like that one""
(Inside di action)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm Special Ed, my deejay's name is Ak-Shun
Put together we're two, yet we're both number one
Cause Ak-Shun got the scratchin, as well as the catch
And I the funky super psychodelic words that match
And we're the best at what we do, in our professions we're the highest
Is it understood, we're very good, if not, try us
One thing to know if you decide to disprespect
Is if you're weak we reserve the right to reject
We don't waste time with toys or weak crews
want to rhyme, get in the line, I take you out by the twos
And Ak-Shun, try to battle him, you're gonna need luck
He's a destroyer, he'll destroy ya, make ya self-destruct
Explode like a bomb into pieces, so then
Superglue couldn't put you back together again
And oh, by the way, you say you want satisfaction
Well, all you had to say was (I want action)

What a man, it's Ak-Shun that remarkable man
If you heard that he could do it, he can do it, he can
If you heard it, if you word it with your lips, what I mean
Is that he cuts so clean, you would think he was a dream
You had, the man is bad, yet the man is not a nightmare
I don't think that it's right or rather quite fair
To a new deejay, you '86er
You can't be the man who was born on a mixer
If you think you broke a record, Ak-Shun is the fixer
If you need a remedy, Ak-Shun uv is the elixir

The Bush

We got the brothers with the heads in dreads
On the corners like pigeons
Smokin marijuana but it's their religions

We got the others on the pipe tip
Goin on the flight trip
Soon on the toon, your mother will right-grip
Basin up the world, chasin up the girls
The fire got too high till you're facin up your curls
Now you're burned, learned your lesson
Stop messin with the crack, black, cause now look how you're dressin
Chokin and totin on the pipes and the woolers
While the dealers are your friends with the Benz plus medullahs
And rings, they're kings because of what they push
And they're part of the heart in the Bush, the Bush

I'm Special Ed, and yes, I'm takin it all
The school that I attend is Ersamus Hall
Live in Flatbush, yes, I'm on
No, I'm not a god, but my word is bond
I got the knowledge, wisdom, understandin
Not fussy, but demandin
No, I'm wise, understand
Mess with me, I break your hand
Stop your heart, take your breath
With the diagnose of death
Remove your brain from your skull
Make ya dumb, make ya dull
Sow you up and cut your hair
Put you in a science fair
Tell em that your name is John
Make you a phenomenon
Freak of nature, make em hate ya
Not a girl will ever date ya
So step off, because you're soft, and I'm a soldier
Go get your crew, and you can tell em what I told ya
Tell em how I burned ya, how you got dissed
Then form a line, so I can add em to the list

If you come to the Bush keep a low pro
Cause you might catch a knot or a shot or a blow
To the face in this place, if you base you will be broken
Comin off the train you gotta pay another token
What this means is, you pay for your protection
Pay a fee and never see a reflection
Again, my friend, or rather foe, you know the deal
Either hear or feel
Choose one, but at least you got an option
Be my son or be up for adoption
Why in heaven's name would you diss?
Do you want to kiss a fist?
We can do this, properly, you're on my property
This ain't a game, but you can say it's a monopoly
Cause I control the total supply, and you're the user
Akshun makes the cuts and Howie Tee is the producer
We make it or break it, so take it just like that
Yes yes y'all, we're all from Flat-

Saw her comin out of the door

Please don't diss, I just want to kiss""
She said, ""Of course,"" kissed with force
Suckin on my lips just like she was a horse
I said, ""Excuse me, please don't bruise me
Please don't tease or skeeze or use me
I'm not like that, I'm not kinky
Would you please remove your pinky

Can't you hear?

Get your hands off the platter
We're standin outside on a crowded block""
I felt her hands goin down on my sock
It's a polo, she was so low down
I coulda swore her knees was on the ground
I said, ""Damn Ma'am, get on your feet
Be on your way, cause you can't have my meat""
Her eyes started waterin, so I brought her
In the store, to buy some more
Tissue, I said, ""Good-bye, I'm gonna miss you""
She said, ""No,"" I said, ""Yo hoe, ho-ho, merry Christmas""
This must be a gift, have you ever imagined that if
You was a manget, and a girl was a metal filing
Would they all come piling?
On your body, growin like hair, yeah?
Well, just think of me as there
Didn't need a girl, had plans for the day
Wanted to step, but she wanted me to stay
You could say she was disturbing my peace

I was coolin on the ave, it was a regular day
Lookin for a girlie, cause I wanted to play
Saw a girl, as I examined her back
Her butt was bigger than a triple dipple Big Mac
As she turned around I had a look at the grill
I said, 'nah - chill'
I turned around, I was about to jet off
When I took a step and bumped into something soft
It was a girl, she was the sweetest thing
Yes indeed, she was a meal, she was fit for a king
I was scopin, but hopin and hopin to rope in
My desire was up, and my resistance was slopin
She said, ""Excuse me, but I was wrong
Maybe I came on a little bit too strong""
I couldn't talk, I couldn't even think
I  said, ""Well, can I make it up, can I buy your a drink?""
She gave a nod to show her acception
To my pleasure, but with one suggestion
Yo, to be alone was the suggestion she had
Which was even better, so we went to her pad
I brought the wine that you call rose
We snuggled up in the couch, yes, we got cosy
She put the glass to her lip, and then she took a sip, and
Tried to get up, but she was slippin and trippin
Did a double summersault, the girlie was flippin
Took a step back, took out the hair clip, and
Unbuttoned her blouse, yes, the girlie was strippin
Put her hands on my pants, the zipper was zippin
Laid me down on the couch, sat down on my hip, and
Straddled up, and then she took a dip, and
The girl was sweeter than a chocolate chip, and
I called her name out loud, I said, Jodie - oh!""
I said, ""You must be down with the rodeo
The way you ride, it might sound silly
But you're ridin up and down like Bronco Billy""
Time went by, the sex had stopped
I looked around, I saw Jodie just dropped
What was the matter, yes, the girl was in shock
She said, ""Special Ed, I think it was your -
But never mind, I be fine, just chill""
I said, ""That's what you get for playin Buffalo Bill""
In a minute the girl recouperated
Gave her some super-strength, and she ate it
I then waited till she finished some soup
And then I said, ""Get the hell out, good lookin out, troop""

And I am one who seeks special education

Special Ed,"Yo, I used to be in love with this girl named Jill
I know why, because she had the butt like that of a hill
But you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Jill was number one
Cause to me, oh my God, how she made me come
I shoulda knew the consequences from the get-go
She would use me like a puppy from a pet show
But like a fool in love I fell for her game
But ah - I got mine everytime I came
You know the place, Flatbush Avenue
Where I first met the hoe, I said, ""Yo, haven't you
Been around before, did we get down before?
I forget, but I bet I met you in a store
Mickey D's - yeah, now I remember""
She said, ""That was for school, I needed money in September
Cause I'm a member of the Booster Squad""
And I was thinkin to myself: I knocked her boots so hard
That's just what I did, until we had a kid
Now the bitch got half my money, plus the crib
Plus the car, plus the limo with the bar
But I guess that's what you get when you're livin like a star

Livin like a

Every day I wake up, I take up my pen
I write a dope rhyme, then I stretch and bend
And I excercise, wipe the boogers out my eyes
And so on... let me go on to the surprise
I'm chillin in my couch in a slouch-like position
Thinkin of a way to spend the day like fishin
Nah - dairy - yeah - cheese
Yo, that's the way to go, but no polly-o, please
Picked up the phonebook, lookin at the pages
Lookin at the star rating right beside the ages
Looked under 'x' for 'sex' and saw Stacy
Yeah, you know the one that we call Dick Tracy
Yes, I think that she can solve my case
So I call her on the phone, she was home alone
She said, ""Come over to my place, I'll cook dinner""
Ring-ring-ring-ring - I think we got a winner
Threw on some dip for the trip across town
Yo, I got to go, cause the hoe is down
So I hopped inside of the rented Corolla
Saw another girlie, she was pushin on a stroller
I said, ""Yo baby,"" then ""Hello, mother""
And then I said, ""Wait a minute, where is the other?""
She said, he said, he wasn't stayin with her
""But maybe we can drop the baby by the sitter
And go for a ride, if I was you, I'd consider""
I dropped the kid off about three blocks away
Went back to the Bush to collect my pay
When I got to the crib ma dukes was home
So I couldn't go inside, cause then I couldn't bone
Bone - T-Bone - yeah, good thinkin
Got to his crib faster than you could blink, and
T-Bone was home alone, I said, ""T
You got to look out now, come on now, this is me
I got cheese, and she's bein naughty""
I heard some footsteps, then came 40
40 Lover smooth like groove to the butter
He was busy guzzlin a 40 like water
He said, ""Ed, let's go get another
No, get two for me, you and my brother""
I said, ""Bet, while I jet just wait""
Went outside just a minute too late
I didn't know where the hell honey dip went till
I saw the cheese breeze by in my rental
Oh, it's sugar, she stole my car

This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, ""Hold up, wait""
Picked up the phone, yelled, ""Who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours""
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, ""Special Ed, don't go, you might die""
Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shut her
I said, ""Sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta

(You're on a mission)
Do what I gotta

This is a mission, not a small-time thing

Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin' of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin' by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin' up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, ""I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission""
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, ""You can smile now, but you won't for long
'Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song""
He said, ""Choose your style"", I broke fool, I said, ""What?""
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, ""Buddah bless"" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again, yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I thought of Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin'
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet

To settle and cease with the noise
You and your boys - it's time to put away the toys
Christmas is over and this is my resolution
To stop the confusion
Let the fresh get fresh and the stale get staler
And throw em in a pale of
Trash with the other trash and smash down the lid
For all the weak shit they did
Never in my life have I seen such preposterous behavior
And you got no flavor
Can't taste the juice cause I got the matz
I heard you paid for your _Billboard_ spots
Honest, I promise, I am not a liar
Can't you understand that I am flier than a flyer
No need to try a stunt like that

I don't need your respect 'cause I,
Got it made,

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted,
Never boosted, never shoplifted,
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin,
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and,
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Ever other month I get a brand new car,
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more,
Kinda fond of honda scooters, got seventy-four
I got the riches, to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies,
Even got a little island of my very own,
I gotta frog, a dog with a solid gold bone,
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti 'cause I own a percent
Got gear out wear, ffor everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A.
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent,
So it really doesn't matter, how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes, daily
You burn me, really?
Think, just blink and I made, a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked, a million times
Damn I'd be paid,
I got it made,

I'm kinda spoiled,
'Cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear, got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead, I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me,
I got the army brigade,
I'm not a trader,
If what you got is greater I'll trade,
But maybe later 'cause my waiter made potato n' alligator souflee,

How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.

Hard to tell the difference between truth and lies
It seems common sense is less common than it likes
I keep asking questions won’t be satisfied
Until they taking away innocence lives
War is money yes money is nice but money is worth less than a productive life 
The body ain't build for the worthless life
So I’m in the gym trying to get mines right
‘Cause I have been foolish, I have abused, I often still do it but I’m only human
Certain things are slave food for the mind, pig’s tail
Not good for the body, chemtrail

You said they have not grown, not like you
But forgetting that you still got growing to do too
And simple fact, is you suppose have a future together so you work with that
I said you wasn’t focused, but now look at you so focused
Somebody else seeing progress, ‘cause they had patience
And I was tired of waiting, but you weren’t tired of waiting
‘Cause you put with me I should of put with you too
Now I'm sitting here saying how much care for
Sitting here sipping on something saying I’m missing you
And all the while you was you waiting full of frustration
Holding you at arms length for ages
I’m kind ashamed to say it, I gotta live with as payment

I never called
And you were my only
Wounds are raw
Now I’m lonely
I gave up sure for unsure

I was a fool for loosing you slowly
Letting you walk away from me
I gave up sure for unsure

Something had to give to you had to live
So you letting go was really the best thing
You did it for yourself I can see that yes
Thinking bout my own selfishness less
Would have been better for us, I brought nothing but fuss
We debated about were we taking this life
I lied to you now I cry for you
'Cause my pride told me that I wanted more than you
But wanty wanty can’t get and get and getty getty nah want it
Foundation wasn’t strong that’s I fell of it
The promise I made to you wasn’t honest
Too smart for myself so I lost the profits of you
Things that I do make me question my sanity
Chasing the one that will never be right for me
I’m kinda of ashamed to say it
I gotta live with that as pain meant

I never called
And you were my only

And the chord change moves me and soothes me
This ain't for the soulless only the soulful souls can really feel this
The cloth that I’m cut with, those I that I grow wid steam fish eat wid it
I see visions in the ceiling, lying on my back on bed I’m reeling in my sanity
‘cause I break down the barriers they put on me
More and more when it come to achievement so many more yes I can feel it
Sometime I hate this these creative rapist test my patience
Talk beyond they stations and they say that its the truth
But all know I cant see no proof
So now my life is yours I’m becoming a caricature
‘cause the aim is to get it like pop but the company you keeps is important
So I prefer to be in the company of su’tin much realer

So it puts me in a pensive mood
When I purposely choose to pursue my own rules.
I’m a problem it’s probably true but what should I do red pill or blue pill
How can I live if I don’t do what I feel, it fall through if the foundation aint real

It’s still like that in Myatt’s Field, tired
Our desires wont lie dormant forever but they think they are so clever

Rewired to ignore injustices that happen to just just-us
They marvel in marvelousness of their greediness
We tired of this so if it’s on us then we be ready to buss

I wake up sometimes in the night

And then I toss upon my bed
And wait for day to come
I try to tell my lonely heart
It must go on alone
But it cries the world has ended

Really worth while, after all
I've been wishing today I could just run away

Some place that's known to god alone
Just a spot to call our own
We'll find perfect peace, where joys never cease
Out there beneath a kindly sky
We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west
And let the rest of the world go by

Is the future to hold just struggles for gold
While the real world waits outside
Away out on the breast of the wonderful west

I can take it away and say that it's mine
He smiles from a distance and lives in a tree
Holding out a welcome hand, a fist for you and me

Money is chocolate, locked in a silver cloud
Everybody knows but no one is around
There's no tomorrow, only today
When it rains, it rains lemonade

So come with me and meet the man 
Whose job it is, is selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings and starts to flying 'round the sky

People are shadows, trapped in a golden well
And only children's lives can break this spell
We live in a land where the clouds go on trees
Birds sound just like a clean summer breeze

I know that this man who does sell time
Is someone whose life lives in my mind
It's all said to think that there is such a man
When you're lonely you can join me in his land

Come with me and meet the man 
Whose job it is, is selling all this time
Before he spreads his wings and starts to flying 'round the sky

Heavy like the weight of my regret forever letting you go

I wish that I knew what I know now

But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars.

Und das ist kein Scherz die Füße sind wund
Doch wir tuns mit dem Herz und das aus einem Grund
Ich bring dir den Schmerz und das aus meinem Mund
Also achte auf die Zeichen es ist Zeit für Vernunft
Die Fakten befinden sich im Hintergrund
Und im Kreislauf hier draußen läuft nicht immer alles Rund
Wissen ist wie Vitamine also bleib Gesund
Und mach mehr, mehr als verkehrt
Dann dreh den scheiss um und mach es umgekehrt
Verseucht von Klischees und die Optik verzerrt
Lernt besser das Leben weils dir hier keiner erklärt
So ist der Mensch, doch der Mensch ist gefährlich
Und nur weil er redet ist er nicht gleich ehrlich
Ein ganzer Planet diesen Cahsflow verherrlicht
Es ist gefährlich, mehr nicht, wehr dich!

Ya no hay pena en tu roto corazón
Sueña que eres feliz
Quiero soñar junto a ti
Y nunca despertar
Si mi voz se acaba el llanto
Renovando tu ilusión

Y si escuece por amor es difícil curar

Spice 1,"Yeah
Spice muthafuckin' One
Coolin' in Cali
Kickin' that gangsta shit
You get with it?

Hopped in my Blazer, mashed off and left a boy in his car, then
Tagged him with the skull and bones, cause he be soften
Hollow like a head without no brains inside
And his girl was so damn small, you had to strain your eyes
Got to the corner, hit a left, seen the HPD
That's when I knew that they were after S-p-i-see-e
Turned up my music and dashed, goin' 90, I mashed
Bullet holes all in my window from a 12-gauge blast
He was all on my ass, I had to think real fast
Hooked a left, all of a sudden heard a boom and a crash
Tried to catch the cold, sold the devil his soul
Had his car and his face wrapped around a pole
With my vogues still smokin' hit 580 to Oakland
Still upset with the police because my window was broken
But my beat was still bumpin' and my amp was still pumpin'
And my nine was in my lap if any funk was jumpin'
Got the twentieth and Nice as I kicked my tune
Hooked a left on twent third and seen my homeboy June
Jumped straight out like an arrow, had more gold than the pharaoh
Had my Nikey sweat suit on and it was read like a sparrow
I told him what had happened and he already knew
He said, ""You got a little funky with a fake-ass crew
The bass went boom and your gun went bang
And all you could see was flames""
At that very moment Coke and Ray started laughin'
And slapped each other's hands and said, ""It's all about blastin'""
In the city streets

City streets

Kickin' it at the park shootin' craps with some homies
My first roll was a 7, so niggas can't get on me
So since my point is 4, I left a Little Joe
I'm kissin' on the dice and I'm pimpin' 'em like my hoe
So then I roll again, I'm fuckin' with Big Ben
Now I ain't fade jack because I'm knockin with that ten
I picked up the dice, shook em up and rolled once mo'
What came out the do'? Whaddaya know, I hit that four
Fuckin' with the dank I'm hearin' Marvin Gaye's oldies
Fadin another twenty, took a sip of my forty
There go my homie G-Nut with the gin and the juice
My nigga's always fuckin with that 187 proof
I took a big-ass gulp and feelin' quite tipsy
Knowin' I'm like this these niggas try to cheat me
Huh, they can't get with me, I put em in his place
Then G-Nut threw the gin and busted a nigga in his face
I thought it was quite funny, and I began to smirk
The fat-ass niggas face was grounded lyin' in the dirt
So I picked up my mail, and I'm about to go
Cause I'm about that mo' money, mo' money, mo'
Now homie on his face, he rolled over just like that
And said, ""This is a jack, gimme all my fuckin money back""
I act like I was scared, gave his money back fast
And when he tried to leave, I busted a cap up in his ass
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause muthafuckas gank ya, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

The city streets

A few weeks back I robbed a nigga for a ki
Kickin it on the block, slingin' d to o-p-e
Yo, runnin' from the five-o, you think this shit is funny
By any means necessary I must make my money
If niggas try to fade me, I pull out my nine
And pop-pop-pop-pop a nigga from behind
In this world of madness muthafuckas die
Niggas sling and bang, and bitches always lie
So I choose to be murderous and chop up niggas' bodies
And set like an example, a villain like John Gotti
The muthafuckin' gangsta S-p-i-c-e
They ring my mobile phone, now who the fuck could that be?
Bitch, I said don't call me, I'm busy clockin' G's
I thought it was the fuzz, but some niggas told me 'freeze!'
The barrel was my back, it's a muthafuckin' jack
I knew I shoulda packed, I ain't goin out like that
These niggas caught me slippin', and fuck a yellow sack
Niggas must be trippin' 'cause they Daytons touch my back
I hopped out of my shit and told him go ahead
And when he tried to leave I busted a cap up in his head
With blood all over his face is how the homie fled
I dragged him out the car and filled his corpse full of lead
These niggas out the kitchen if you can't take the heat
Cause bitch, I'm a gangsta, shank ya, sank ya in the city streets

Aight, Banks
Let's pack the shit up, mayn",City Streets

He dropped his gat I picked it up and blew his ass down
I know it's scandalous but a simple fuckin' dirty fact, 
I'd rather hear my Uzi rat-a-ta-ta-tat-tat
It's for protection not to kill or break a nigga's bones, 
Back to the story, here's the story B the story on
His guts were scattered he was splattered up against the wall, 
My homey G was on my phone buggin' off my call
I tried to smash but I'm lookin' at some high beams 
Into the eyes of some muthafuckin' dope fiend
He seen me shoot him so I shot him blew his ass off, 
I shot my Uzi up in the air and then I smashed off
I'm rollin' thicker than a milkshake,

The government keep the profit of cocaine in a way.

The niggas up on the block send for me every day. 
A thousand everyday will keep the 5-0 away.

Looked in my mirror cose range right behind me, 
Tinted windows up in the Benz 190

If I don't smash full of buckshot he will fill me
Hangin out the car shots scatter windows shatter trouble, 
I'll shoot him up bathed in his blood like Mr Bubble 187 did I do it with an AK, 
Another day a nigga dead up in the alleyway 
Why did I do it, it's my pistol and I packed it, 
I think they need to lock my ass up in a straight jacket
So all you suckas listen close to this warnin', 
While I get into your ass like Charmin

With nothin' but dried up funk to smell
I thinkin' about the times that I ganked fools 
And why I'm coolin' in these fucked up county blues
I've murder muthafuckas singular and in a pair, 
And in the morning I'll be getting the electric chair
But do I care, Yo I could give a fuck less, 
The CIA, FBI got it in the chest
Tappin' my phone calls, wires hidden in my walls, 
I had the money flowin' smooth like Niagara Falls
The glory got so I'm considered a murderous criminal, 
Because my bullet ate his ass like a cannibal
Before I chopped him with AK I made him say his grace, and then I
Emptied the clip off up in his fuckin' face
His partner callin' for backup as I was breakin' out, 
Nigga refused to die, that's what I heard him shout
I hit the corner with quickness because I ain't the one, 
To feel the fuckin' blast of a shotgun
And when they fry my ass, I'm goin' straight Hell,

But nigga, don't step too close, I might kill ya
I couldn't really tell who he was
But I ain't really trippin', 'cause the dank got a nigga buzzed
I hop out of my shit and lock the car do'
As I step into the store I'm starin at some hard hoe
She said ""whats up"", like a nigga, to me
I walked to the back and fired up my doobie
Should I get St. Ides or Olde E?
Looked up, some niggas runnin' at me, 'bout 4 deep

Pulled up on the side
shootin' at the nigga that I busted with the St. Ides

He want to pump my gas, but I think I seen a forty four
I figured it's a jack, because instead
Of gas, he wanted to pump me full of lead
So now I need a murder plan
Reach under the seat with my left hand
He walked up lookin' funny at a nigga
I'm sittin' calm as fuck with my finger on a chrome trigger
Nigga want to see my blood waste
But little did he know he was fuckin' with a nut case
He tried to pull a forty four
But soon as he reached I fucked him up with the car do'
I got out the car and stomped his ass, gee

Every nigga do whatever the fuck he gotta do
The mothafuckin' rhyme did the crime last century
Now it's on parole because my mouth's in penitentiary
But back to the ghetto you see just about it all
Rest in peace to dead niggas on the wall
The shit it never stop because the nigga killed a cop
And now the cops are killin' the niggas twenty four around clock
Around the block around the road in every ghetto 
Muthafuckas want to drop me, so I'm livin' like the Devil
With the underground pound, murder facul-sound
So niggas that fuck around lay around
And before I end this rhyme 
I'd like ta say peace to my mothafuckin' nine

The nine millimeter, the nine millimeter

Shootin' dice with some niggas that I didn't know
He pulled a nine when the double 4 hit the floe
I wonder why he'd want to play me like a punk bitch
I thought he knew I was the one to let the nine click
I played his ass like Jesse James and shot him in the throat
I picked his tongue up out my mail, now I'm outty ho
I'm stressin' it's a fucked up world ""G""
I think about the shit that I used to see
Niggas runnin' 'round with the street sweepers
Muthafuckas layin' dead loose change, beepers
Bitches screamin' about the niggas gettin' fucked up
Fuck his bitch too, she was stuck up
187 muthafuckas that my showcase
I'll load the clip and kill a whole muthafuckin' race
I'm stressed out like a muthafucka
Bitch got me for a twenty, damn clucka
Yeah your right I'm livin' wrong ""G""
And I never gave a fuck about a dope fiend family
I seen a dope fiend killed last week
Left a bloody base pipe in the street
They burnt the bitch up in the trunk over 80 dollars
Started drivin' around the hood and I can hear her hollar
Smoke comin' from the trunk bitch burnin' up
Cops turnin' down the streets they was turnin' up
I'm hearin' shots ring out 12 o'clock at night
A car full of dead niggas in the midnight
Because it gave the cops a reason just ta shoot 'em up
But now they tape the shit off, so yo suit 'em up
And before I end this rhyme
I'd like ta say peace to my muthafuckin' nine

The nine millimeter, 
The nine millimeter

The police was comin' I had ta dump the body
But like I said on the city streets I'm John Gotti
When it comes to the gangsta rap shit
I do a drive-by murder your whole click
See I'm a rebel without a pulse
Cause in my neighborhood you learn not to walk 
Without a nine in your draws
It's like American Express
Because a lot of crazy niggas want to spill your flesh
But some crazy jealous muthafuckas never sleep
I'm gettin' C.B. banner on the beep, beep, beep
Fill a, nigga to the rim like brim
Do a drive-by while I'm suckin' on a Endo stem
Mix Hennesey with Thunderbird, Gin and juice
I'm high as fuck, fuckin' around with 187 proof
Hard as a nickel but I'm quick as fuck to drop a dime 
Because my boys got a nigga back prime time
Rata-tata-tat-tat
Any bitch want to squab it's like that
Cause I ain't goin' out like a fag
Got the nigga for a ounce and a Jag
Straight trip and pop the clip
Now I'm gettin' rich off his sip
Pick up my boys on the block and it's on
Slangin' dope by the drug-free zone
Straight gangsta mack
Keyes over keyes over g's I stack
So when you step, step with caution
Cause a nine to your throat 'll have ya caughin'
The S-P-I-see-E
In a rage with a gauge gettin' P-A-I-D
I ain't goin' out fuck Mickey D's
I'd rather pimp hoes and clock G's
Cause that's what a real nigga do to make a livin' 
The talent of pimp was naturally given'
So before I end this rhyme 
I'd like to say, Peace to my mothafuckin' Nine

Yeah
I want to say peace to my other muthafuckin' nine
Yeah Ant muthafuckin' ba-ba-booga-booga muthafuckin' Banks
I want to say what up to my nigga G muthafuckin' mzz-Nut, yeah
I want to say what up to that girl Shorty B in the muthafuckin' house
And my mutha fckin' D.J. 
Xtra muthafuckin' Large go on with your big ass heh-heh
Yeah, my nigga M.C. muthafuckin' Ant
Kickin' the funky shit with Spice muthafuckin' 1
187 in the muthafuckin' house, Peace",Peace to My Nine
Spice 1,"Y'all ready to do this shit?

Bust 'em

When I was young I had the lust to pull the trigger
And make change out a 5-dollar-ass nigga
And as time went on, I gained much love
But seein' niggas' guts bust at a nightclub
Too young to get my ass in, but they didn't trip
Cause if I didn't get in, they knew I'd start shit
So I was treated like the mothafuckin' pope
Security see me, so they scope
And follow me around like a flock of hoes
I had a squab with a bitch with a big-ass nose
I started to knock the bitch out, but before I could
I'm stopped short by a redneck peckerwood
But he was slow, with the other hand slapped the hoe
Then security rushed us out the backdo'
So when I grabbed the nine, they thought I'd go nuts
I'd roll by and bust caps at the grown-up's
Young nigga got bold and off the liquor
As a young nigga

(He said, ""Young-ass nigga!"")
(You dumb nigga, you),-> Ice Cube

Well, what do you know, it's summer time
And every young nigga my age is on the grind
Workin' for the city
A drugstore on every goddamn corner, and niggas actin' shitty
About who sell where and whose dope is it
So some niggas around the block, they paid us a visit
But we ain't comin' off shit but a drive-by
I guess they want to expand to go city-wide
So we hung muthafuckas by the barbed wire
Whoever was a snitch or bitch or liar
And five-o is gettin' kinda dense
Cause the wire was missin' from a county jail fence
Breakin' off boulders
And the niggas from around the block they said they told us
Not to short-stop, so my nigga got popped
I looked down, and I'm shocked
To see him layin' dead by the bushes
As a young nigga

Shit is gettin' hectic, my mission had to flow smooth
We hit the corner in a '65 old school
Bustin' at niggas twice my age
Muthafuckas catchin heat from my gauge
They tried to shoot back, but it ain't like that
Cause I'm the nigga with the biggest gat
Hoes get fucked and eat the bullet
Cause the trigger that got my nigga, one of them had to pull it
My nigga with the nine said, ""Forget it""
But I seen a nigga point his finger and say, ""He did it""
I loaded up the clip and shot him in the dick
And kept on bustin' till his leg kicked
Now we Audi five thousand, gee
The glasspacks on the sixty five got noisy
We had to smash
Cause five-o was right behind our ass
We had to get away, we dumped the A.K.
And the gauge in the bushes on the way
The cops kept bustin', niggas kept cussin'
About which way to go fussin
We hit the corner, and they bust
At some niggas lookin' just like us
We knew it was about that time
Hopped out my homeboy's shit, and into mine
We got away, because they couldn't figure
Which one of the boys was that young nigga",Young Nigga
Spice 1,"I'm tryin' to keep my aces and my deuces all together
I'm thinkin' of self-murder I know I won't live forever
This chronic got me noid I need to get a job
But instead I want to sell dope hang on a rope and steady mobb
I'm wakin up in the morning thinkin' of death as I break out in a cold sweat
I'm havin dreams of a whole family put to rest
Visions of a dead man body bags
And all the youngsters gettin' their cap peeled over colored rags
I write about murder and death 'cause that's all in the hood
Comin' up strong while in crack yo G its all good
Describin' a way of life that they don't understand G
So Imma keep breakin' it down until dey understand me
You see its real G and jealousy it roam my block
That's why I'm never leavin' the house without my plastic glock
Cause if they want it they'll take it and kill for it
And if its worth sumptin' then blood gettin' spilled for it
My mother thinks I'm goin' crazy 
And when I leave the house she just stares out the window
I think I'm being followed every time I leave my home
Havin' these fatal thoughts of gettin' chrome to my dome

[Chorus]
18, 187 me say the murder the murder he wrote
18, 187 me say the murder the murder he wrote, blow

Did things up in the past that I regret at 22
And when I hit 23 I hope I'm livin' well as you
Its good to be alive in 93 I guess that so
But if I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go
I guess I'm just a soldier with a song out of the streets black
Stressin' of that chronic sack but I feel death is knockin' at my bed
Sleep walkin' with my pistol in the middle of the night
Wakin up inside my hooptie holdin' my glock full of fright
Violent in this art that's only because its comin' from a G to the heart
Got friends that have died and I mourn for their families
Bringin' flowers to dey graves every time I get a chance G
Nothin' like a old school homie from the hood
Which are right or wrong doin' dirt doin' good
And now I know inside I'll never see my boy again
I fie myself always pour brew out fo my friends

[Chorus]

I'm keepin' all my pictures from my homies up in jail
If I told you what dey did it will problably turn your pale
I used to hang with killers and I didn't even know
Wrestlin' with my homies as a youngster age four
Now half of dem is dead and the rest is in the jailhouse
Writin' to me monthly givin they homies somethin' to rap about
Tell me do my music and don't trip off what dey say
Thinkin' to myself I might just be in there one day
Some stayed about the big house and still slangin' yay
And now dey stayin' under diction of feds everyday
Tryin to wash their money they want to go on tour G
Gettin' into the business learn about the industry
Try to help 'em out doin' everythang I can 
I still gotta worry bout the next jealous man
My homies gettin' robbed so they rob somebody else
You can see it never stops let that story tell itself
I'm walkin' with my head down pervin' in the rain
Thinkin' deep askin' myself am I insane
I think about that daily and I'm leavin' on that note 
And that's the definition of the 187 that he wrote

So now I gotta smob and p-p-p-pop, pop
And buck with that 380 until a motherfucker drop

And fry that ass like sissaneen
Cause in the Bay there are no red or no blue guys
Muthafuckas just drop life shoo flies
So when you come don't claim no blue or red
Cause these niggas will color your ass dead
I gotta keep my Tech-9 in the bushes
Made more mail than the rest of the pushers
I'm standin tough like wrangler
Niggas don't care if you're a crip or a blood 
We are all get the gas chamber

[Chorus]

Break mine up became a slang word
sellin' that cooked up 'caine bird
Is a key to a mothafuckin' G
bustin' caps in the mix back in 1983
So that's old school shit to me 
I want to live to see 23
But these niggas in the ghetto crave
To see a nigga layin' dead in a fuckin' grave
And I gots to come sick with it
I sold dope and crack and shit but didn't stick with it
Cause the boys in blue they got some new shit
A helicopter that you can't fuck with
And the funky-ass black on white
Ran blue lights with that engine somethin' tight
But 5-0 can't fuck with the 5.0 
Cause I'm a old school nigga at the sat show
I whip shit and get the niggas straight stuck on 
Pigs have a coke and a smile and get the fuck on
Cause I'm the same old nigga 
Even though my pocket's phat my belly's bigger
I'm at the age 22
17 years old shit I probably gaffled you
But forget that shit because it's all good
And Mr. Rogers ain't got shit on my neighborhood
Cause we was all young gangstas livin' on a razor
Fucked with us and we sprayed you
But in '93 it ain't for you and me 
Cause we're straight get the gas chamber

[Chorus]

Coughin'
On the real tho' partna
This is what a nigga's tryin' to say
When you shoot the next muthafucka 
You goin' to jail regardless of what mothafuckin' color you got on
You know I'm sayin' 
You gonna get the gas chamber regardless
So when I do this shit for some cash anyway
Like my lil' partna Bushwick say:
""If shit don't make dollars, it don't make sense""

Nigga was runnin' with drop top drop havin' a fun-day
Kickin' it with my niggas up on the block
Talkin' shit drinkin' ""crooked eye""

I'm feelin' good I want to kick it and hang out
But when the drive-by hit this is the main route
What the fuck is my problem nigga?

So why should I trip, load the clip, put the joint to my lip
Get the motherfuckin' forty take a real ass nigga hit

Some niggas roll up in an old school
I ain't trippin', ay 'g' you know this nigga's face
I heard the motherfuckin' bass
Of a sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Musty dead bodies and a catty bump, trump
Smellin' up the neighborhood lyin' in the bushes

Ice spit some shit about that shit nigga

Get off my dick nigga get your own motherfuckers
Steady mobbin' gaffle the motherfuckers 'cause my jobbing
Shootin' up motherfuckers was my hobby
Stop the tech-eleven on two-eleven I did a robbery
Shot the mothefucker is grenades that I'll be livin'
Lowin' the motherfuckers like a new pair of Levi's and
Used to think the cops were so motherfuckin' friendly
Till they tied my cousin to a chair and broke his chin ?g'
My homies motherfuckin' head like a melon
Slavery is ? of convicted felon
So dear mr. officer of the motherfuckin' law
Rodney kind don't need a trial what was seen was what was saw
You could take the niggas up out the motherfuckin' ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto up out the motherfuckin' niggas
Can't you hear the voice of the niggas comin' at cha?
Fuck you mr. president I think I want to gat ya
I need mo' mail than the rest of the pushers
Mo' mail than the rest of the piles

What I want you to do boy, drop that ill shit

I'll make this gat sing like motherfuckin' Mary J. Blige
And reminisce on havin' a nigga's last breath when he slowly die
Stang his ass in the chest with the hollow
Capped him in his thr-thr-throat so he can't swallow
Are-a-rat t-a-tat put a buck in why'all
The motherfuckin' six-foot chucky dog
Comin' to play with the trigger of the AK
Another real ass nigga from the east bay
?w-e-l-l-t-e-p-are-o-o-f?
For the niggas who kid yourself by losin' your fuckin' death
Bloaw! bloaw!
Cap, we do it just like that
Quick to put a motherfucker brains in his lap
Smokin' up a blunt as I reminisce
Of bloody body bags a motherfucker going nutty
Bloaw! bloaw!

Cause the shit get major, put the Montgomery number upon his pager

His blood hit the mothafuckin' wall
Ran to the trunk and got the AK 'cause the funk was on
It felt like Christmas Day
I got a present and it come with a banana clip
Santa Claus muthafucka meet the hollow tip
But let me get to the trunk so they fucked up
Now I'm 'bout to explode, niggas suckin' chrome up
Kick down the door and started spraying
My nigga on the ground eyes wide open dead layin'
Busted a nigga in the back rat-a-tat-tat
His blood hit the floor first
I heard his back crack
Sounds of a mothafuckin' murder, the ghetto got me insane
To my damn brain
Never leavin' the house without my Glock nine
You can't stop crime so I'ma cock mine
The other nigga had a baby mack
And he was off the crack
He shot and missed and I shot back
But we both hit the floor, what the fuck for
I caught a bullet up in my chest and I didn't know
But the bulletproof vest was on G
So I kept buckin at his ass like a donkey
And when I tried to run and get out
The pig put the Glock to my mouth

Screamin' some shit about a barbecued nigga
I had a pocket full of 'cane and a bloody gat
I went insane when they blasted my cutty mack
He was my potna like En Vogue wish he hold on
But I don't think he'll be alive for too much long
I dropped the Glock with a puzzle look on my face 
'cause now I'm stuck with the dope and fuckin' murder case
They threw me in the car and told me they that wanted a cut
And if I try to get away a motherfucker stuck
Excuse me officer but you can suck a nigga dick
He looked me in the eye and told his potna get the bitch
Slobberin' at the mouth, mothafuckin' K-9
Put it in my face told me not to waste time
What's my name? Spice mothafuckin' Ace
Yelled fuck the pig, spit a loogey in his face
He let that goddamn K-9 go
Me and that bitch had it out on the floor
It went on for five minutes or less
Teeth marks on my mothafuckin' neck and chest
He took me down to the county
I'm seein' pictures of my niggas on the wall for the bounty
I walked in with blood on my pants and
Niggas lookin' at me like a black Charles Manson
And I still had dope in my mouth 'cause I'm fresh out da crackhouse

Coppers gave me hell in a cell

They thought my heart was playin' life at a different pitch
But I stick to the scrip 
Dump a snitch in a ditch
Its 94 I came to be fuckin' around 
Paranoia of a jack so I'm quick to draw down
The only way I gets my mail is to be off in your ass
With a AK or a Uzi screamin' 
Give me your cash nigga
So back to fuck on up
Cause can't nobody stop this nigga to sellin' a D that's raw and uncut
Fuckin' over fiends
Laughin in their faces sellin' ""soap"" to niggas can die anyday
Niggas come showed off in them jacks G
Another homie eyes wide open dead in my backseat
We never thought that they would get him
My nigga was like a soldier we'd never knew that the bullet hit him
Thought to myself was cocaine with my homie's life 
He picked the crime Do or Die now he pays the price
To look in struggle on his face with his Gat in his hand
My nigga died
With the face of a desperate man

And don't nobody run up on me
Cause Franklin and Grant is my only motherfuckin' homie
I made a deal with the devil and sold my soul
Through about O.E. and fourteen-years old
Young hog ass nigga never ever saw of
Got me a strap and learned not to shoot my brolls of
And all the youngsters sneakin pass the bottle 
Because the G's, pimps and hustlers was the motherfuckin' role model
And every time we had a house party
Was just the chance for a nigga to see another nigga's dead body
And nobody stayed around for sequels
Cause the nigga that was bustin' was spreadin' bullets around equal
Now they mobbin'
I'm seein' sparks hearin' shots
Pistol's popped 
Another motherfucker flopped
On the ass first up by the 44
Flatline ambulance put him in the door
Loud screams from his homies yellin' Imma smoke 'em
Feelin bad 'cause his partners on blood joke 'em
A touchin scene niggas screamin' in the rain
Looked in his homeboy's face
His homie said his name

Murder is a part of the game and the jealous got me strapped
Crunch nappy sack, sick homies who got my back
Dead bodies, handcuffs, and house rage
Two and the one up on that dope track, sportin' gangsta brains
Me and my homies feelin' bail up in the hooptie
With the fifth degree in martin, the car ain't startin'
Some haters rolled up fo' deeper than the Chevy
Wavin' techs up in the air like machine-gun kelly
I tell all my partners to bail up out the bucket
One raised the clout and the other gettin' ducked quick
Enough, been rough so I begin to bust, straight dome shots
Droppin got them shakin' like they cop lockin'
Ski skirt clout smokin' down the street
With his player partner beatin up at these niggas up in the other seat
I check myself see if I'm shot, but they don't hit me
Shoppers singin like Whitney they wanna fit me
With a full metal jacket, but they don't get me
Not one bullet touch my body, not even nick me
We rushed my homie to the nearest carsa hospital
But it's too late he all felt stiff like a pop sickle (damn!)

Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah!
I don't give a fuck about you
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah!

We shipped this spot for homicide, heat emergency
Feelin' go perform my own open heart surgery
Because my partner shouldn't died like that
We gotta show my homie love and get them busters back
So we mobb through the ghetto lookin' for revenge
But we can't find a soul, fools talkin' bout us gettin' cold
Behold a chevy with gold deeds
Could these be the headers who made my hooptie look like swiss cheese
Fools musta turned the lights off and let's get closer
Don't let em see you pull your mask down, pull out the dullja's
With tales from the creepin' on the hush feelin' leave fo' suckers in a dutch
The midnight drama don't stop so if you get some dirt
They'll dig you in the clear, cause player, you'll be outta here
We ain't no suckers, we doin' it like john gottie
We left them fools in the parkin' lot with open bodies

Situations gotta stick, I got my own cop tryin to test me
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah!
I don't give a fuck about you
As long as the pigs don't go step on my shoes
Got me caught up in this drama, yeah!

We built up out the scene with out a clue
People call the police but that's all they can do
We hit the freeway in a bucket, feelin' no remorse
We regulatin' in the ghetto with deadly force
And ain't nobody tellin' nothin' about the decease
Cause if you snitch your family count will get decrease
Up in the game them things gonna be poppin' ya, 
187 in the style of the mafia
This ain't no business for busters, trick ass haters
Try their pager, jealous cause you livin' major
Hit me on my pager, sharp as a razor
And suckers who don't feel me, get the red laser
And sicker than a hangover, fools try to slang boulders
But get snatched out their range rovers

Up in this muthafucka
You know you're fuckin' 
With the original dead body chucker
Punk ass niggas can't get next to this
Dead O.G.'s be hautin my body like the mothafuckin' exorcist
Run up on niggas dumpin they homies
Bodies up out they car
Its just some hardcore shit 
That's uncut and raw
We do the shit 'cause niggas can't understand
That everybody up on the block 
Can't be the mothafuckin' top man
Its scrilla for every nigga so strive
And you will be the nigga to survive

5-1-0 and 2-1-3 is you a baller or a G?

Ha ha ha. 
To thug or not to thug? 
To G or not to G? 
See that's the question. 
Every time I hit L.A. I get love you know 'cause I'm from the Bay.
Dub see, Big Syke you know Spice 1,  feel me. 
Count the dollars on the Lexy don't waste your time 
Let it shine let it shine let it shine
Mizzolas and 850 flossin' I'm tossin' 
Doobies up out the window smokin' often coughin'
Chokin' hard up off the indo smoke
My mens with extra clips Hennessy Lemon squeeze begin to dip on me
The G with the strap up on my side
Keepin' these haters upon they toes 'cause they know I'm ready to ride
Hide but you can't get away
This is your dead homie you should of put your tool away
But you still pull it on me, see I ain't trippin' 
I got foot soldiers that do dirt for me
Love me enough to hurt for me and do some work for me
Black roses is sent to the families with all the lives lost
Kill 'em soft pay off my henchmen like a mob boss
Mobster ballin' out the hooptie
Who could it be? S.P.I.C.E.

[Chorus]

Sound like baller I'm caught up in troubled times
Destiny knows help me free my mind
What can I do but stay true and be a man
I'm just doin' what I can
Migrate to Oakland lay low with my dog Spice
Hang out with killers and dodge device
Gotta pay the price took a life or maybe two (was it two?)
I wouldn't of done it if I didn't have to
In the wrong place at the right time evil minds learkin'
Thought I was over peerkin' searchin' for a home I feel alone
On these cold streets, sleepin' on couches with no sheets
God guide me hide me from incarceration and start this desperation
I'm facin' more time then I really got to give
Damn I want to live in 2-1-3

[Chorus]

It's the Dub S.C. on G parolee
And although deez steadily grinding for cheese
Trunk fulla keys on my way O.T. from 5-1-0 to the 2-1-3
I puts it down bendin' the corner with my all blue Chevy
My mind on gettin' the fetti, my heater cocked back and ready
With G's crime related, affiliated eyes faded
Big bodies paper plated stayin' shaded for federated
My crews full of nothin' but riders high off the Remy
Chuck Taylors neck pieces and knitted beenies (uh ha)
Mashin' on the regular hustlin' day and night
Went from chronic to water but now we pushin' the China white
Much loved by many but now by many hated
Trippin' off the the haters lookin' mad 'cause we made it
But don't get mad at me because I executed the game
I got my hustle on lock you can do the same

Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station
You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga where the scrilla
Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off my mask
Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash
Mobbing I mash out, you ass out
Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse
Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm
Down for thefetty
Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and deadly

I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith
And Wesson

One time for your mind
Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers
All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters
Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ?
Drug dealers peep the shit that I kick
Hustling, busting down zips making chips
If we ain't making it we taking shit
To the extreme hit the scenery with machine
Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream
Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ? nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts
Caps at your house
Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth
About to L-U, didn't they tell you
I'm a youngster trying to have something like my
Nigga L-Q

Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never get your dividends
Balling til I die, until I die I'll be a baller
Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shot-caller
Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay them forever
Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow stripe
But pull me back, because they cowards and shit

Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga

And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
? my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
? chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P

When you get to flossin up in that Lexus potna
Look what the tied washed in

Straight out the water
Finna wet you up and leave your body soaked with some of that redrum
So come on, come one and come on dem all 
And watch them bodies fall

Smile in your face all the while they want to take your place
I was strapped with a gun case 
But now I'm back out on the paper chase
Spittin' ?'em game 
And I'm usin' my mouth piece like Ron O'Neil
The G from back in the day 
They always say I spit the real
Keepin' these haters out of my pockets
And always watchin' my spine
The role of a playa is force and still looks out for mine

But if you cross game then I'm gone carry ya
Up out the gangsta party quicker than you can think
Rolexes upon the wrist and diamonds on the pinky playa
Poppin' the cork on champagne 
Hundred dollars a bottle
We roll in benzes and coups as if we won Lotto
Don't let me hear you talk bad about a playa name 
'cause if you get your scratch on haters gone do the same

South Central nigga what? 
The representer, damn your girl seen me comin' and ran 
Young enough to be my daughter

To state to my man for man slaughter

Fell in the relapse besides I'm a trauma a nigga 
Look in the eyes and when you see me I be hardcore 
What the fuck a real nigga gotta lie to kick it for? 
I'm tired of these bubblegum ass niggas 
Throwin' monkey wrenches into the game

Spice 1,"Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone 
You can tell that the East Bay was his home
More mail than the rest of the pushers, 
'cause he's got a tech nine in the bushes 

And that's how the shit was handled, 
First name Jack, last name Daniels
Had two boys named E and J, 
E had the nine and J the AK
Clocked on a street called Hennessey, 
Robs with a mother fucker named O.E.
E had a bitch and her name was Gin, 
Had a nigga named Juice doin' time in the pen
You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though, 
'cause she was fuckin' some nigga named Cisco
E and J knew tonight they'd come 
With two fat niggas named Bacardi and rum
The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary, 
The bitch was all bloody and her name was Mary
Officer Martini wiped up the body, 
And all fingers pointed at Rum and Bacardi 
E and J told Jack the hotel, 
So Jack tried to bail Juice out of the jail
But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout, 
So Jack shot the judge up and rolled Juice out
Now everybody's talking 'bout Gin and Juice, 
Juice shot Gin 'cause the bitch was loose
Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me, 
I'll round up the posse and call up Mickey 
Mickey was big, he only sold 8 balls, 
Had ninety nine niggas up against the wall 
E and J found out he made the call 
So E and J and Jack and Juice nined them all
They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill, 
Got the money from the bitch reckless Strawberry Hill
Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive, 
But Mickey was slick he had a Colt forty five 
And now he's wonderin' how he got the word, 
It was the neighborhood wino Thunderbird
You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice, 
It was a hundred and eighty-seven proof, 
Check it out

Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird, 
Time for the Hurricane he said word
Thunderbird in an alley waitin', 
Wearin' a beanie, tryin' to get a sip from the cop Mr Martini
St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird?s top, 
Spilled his drank and gave a swig to the cop
But it's too late Martini knows it all, 
Mickey and his boy OD were slangin' 8 balls
Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill, 
So when he asked for Juice he got a quick fill 
Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks, 
The murderous cop killer Mr Peppermint Schnapps
Mickey had this thing about nosey cops 
And it made Mr Peppermint lose his top
Martini off duty waitin' for the Night Train, 
Didn't know his wife Champagne would never see him again
Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45, 
Gotta peel his cap before the train arrives
Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train 
All the boys said the engineers Bartles and Jaymes
There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast, 
Martini fell on the ground there was a big splash
Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him, 
St. Ides and Mickey in a 'vette ready in front of the station
But you know Jack and Juice was undercover, 
And Jack was mad be 'cause Mickey shot his lover 
There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced, 
He couldn't hang with the 1-8-7 proof
Juice was splattered and St. Ides had took a fall, 
And then Endo smoked 'em all
Check it out!",187 Proof

Used to hang out with killers slang Ice and Speed
Speed had a little bitch named Mary Jane
Who had a brother named Coke and he carried a cane
Coke and Endo two big macks
Coke had a grenade, told Endo catch
Doin' it just for fun best friends don't gank
You catch 'em kickin' it at the park a lot fuckin' with Dank
Dank was real just a hardcore nigga
Shot his bitch up 'cause she drank all the liquor
Seen him at the park drinkin' 40's last week
Did a drive-by on some niggas in a Jeep
He shot up Heroin and P.C.P.
Some niggas from a clique called L.S.D.
These niggas wasn't playin' they got straight to the point
Shot up his mothers house col' smoked the joint
All he left was two brothers by the last name Doobie
Two midget ass gangsters both strapped both nuttey
One had the nine and the other had the 4-5
When they did a ht it took 'em both to drive
Didn't use nothin' fast like a Vette or a Jag
Did a drive-by in the mothafuckin' drop top Zig-Zag
Coke and his sister Mary Jane
On Marijuana block drinkin' 40's to the brain
And wadn't trippin' off the gunshots
Cause on Marijuana block no one calls the cops

And got paid green at midnight

So the cops had ta roll up Sess. for me 
Officer Taylor with the high beams
Talkin' that gang shit strapped with a dope screen
Ran up on Coke and Jane
Fucked up Coke and beat him down with his own cane
Said you better quite fuckin' with Dank
Cause if you don't I'll turn your ass to crank
And smashed off on a speedball
Cause he just got the Doobie brothers drive-by call
Dank hit the corner something caught his eye
That sexy ass black bitch Chocolate Tye
She was thick and rich, bitch couldn't be cuter
Had nice brown eyes and a big round budda
Took her to the 'tel didn't pull no stunts
Told the bitch he was fuckin', the nigga was quite blunt

Pullin up a 500 with the 20-inch D's
A muthafucka better freeze
When he see me cockin these
Two glocks, bust off a few shots
Catch a muthafuckin case like 2Pac
A real nigga gotta have balls and brains
To maintain in the game
Livin in the city with the killers and thugs
And might be dealin some drugs
A nigga either show love
Or bust slugs in mugs
Time tickin on my Rolex
Niggas be watchin me dippin and trippin if I'm heated
Cause I leave they ass deleted, erased
I seen the bitch in his face
When I was pullin on the trigger
One less nigga
Enemies stallin, I be killin em all
Cause I got the brains and balls
And I don't beckon for no bitches or no niggas at all
It's r.i.p. on the wall
I be the last nigga standin tall

To maintain in the game

A baller fiend for cream
I weigh my muthafuckin life on a triple beam

Don't let your mouth write a check that your balls can't cash
Or put your Uzi where you mouth is, nigga, we on a mash
Ain't no rules to the game, muthafuckas run up and blast
Drive the car in a alley, throw the body up in the trash
If it wasn't for rappin I'd be jackin you muthafuckas
With the fully automatic, we killers, you can't touch us
Tell me how you gon' deal with the niggas that feed
When they're comin from the city where the murderers bleed
Keep a strap on the side, a A.K., Mac-10
Watchin all my enemies and all my friends
Rollin up on niggas with the Tec in a Benz
Might need checkin my ends, money and power'll win
And when the enemies see me, I'ma dip in the cut
Pull out my Uzi and tear his muthafuckin ass up
Mob shit, dumpin and jump in a drive-by bucket
Screamin out 'fuck it'!

When I'm dead throw a blunt in my casket if I didn't die high
My niggas go to war for me in gee rides
Skip the killas, real niggas pack Uzis up in the pillows

Puttin niggas in comas if he ain't dead from the blast
Get to hospital, stick a knife in his ass
Mob into the hooptie, put the foot to the gas
Forget wearin a mask and stick and move real fast
Got the morgue on my pager
Niggas be talkin 'bout killin me while I'm sleepin in my bed alone
And when I'm headin home they want to follow me on
Until I tap em with the strap and get to bustin the chrome

A nigga didn't have brains 'cause he smoked since
Or sess, or whatever you want to call it
He got the task on his ass, better haul it
Fiends suckin' up the crack in the backyard
Dropped a pebble on the ground, now he's lookin' hard
Will he keep searchin' or will he cease and just forget the hit?
Or pull a jack move and let the nine click
I'm in the cut, late night, about 12 o'clock
I see some brothers bustin' caps in a parking lot
There go my homies rollin' up in a black 'Vette

""Another day, another dead up in the alleyway""

Or two or three or four
Cause every brother in my hood is hardcore
Boom-boom! to the death of a cop
Pop-pop-pop!, see another one drop
Crazy-ass nigga off the peppermint schnapps
And now you wonder why young niggas sling hop?
Never woulda thought I'd be a dealer of dope
Niggas slingin' and bangin' and breakin' necks and throats
The spot, it was poppin', but yet the fuzz kept ridin' my jock
Tick-tock, I watch the clock, they flock
See a undercover cop raise off the block
That's how it is in the game of slingin' rocks

I see a dope fiend yellin' he's a O.G.
He scratched his head and started starin' like he knows me
I say, ""What up, old man, I seen your face before""
It was my homie's pops, shirt dirty, pants tore
He had a 40 in his hand, left a little swallow
He said, ""Young-ass nigga,"" and then he threw the bottle
I ducked down, and I had to duck real fast
Stepped two feet back, and then I banked his ass
I started kickin' and stompin' my nigga's brains out
I heard a bitch yell ""freeze!"" and runnin' out the house
It was his wife, and the bitch started bustin' at me
I can't believe this shit, this bitch is trigger-happy
Pull out my nine, bust the bitch in the left titty
That's how it is in a burned-out dopefiend city

Life's too sweet to pass by
Lookin at the hourglass, I
See how fast time fly
I keep a strong will to live
I be a old man with a lotta game to give
I'll make the kids do somethin more positive
Instead of bein like me, a thug or gee
Tryin to stay up out the penitentiary
I got a whole army, some r.i.p.
Some stuck in a cell, some out on bail
Some doin major fed time in jail
I'm lookin at the world with hungry eyes
Inner city full of jealousy and lies
Hopin that the Lord'll hear my cries
Help a young black male rise
Enemies pose as friends
Player never know when his life'll end
Can't trust too many, can't cross the game
Walk with my head down in the rain
Think about greed, some disease
Cause everybody rappin still gettin cheese
Some think about the pain that they inflict
And some don't think, just stack the chips

Everyone wan to go to heaven
But nobody wan to die

Everyone want a million dollar
But nobody want to work

Everybody want a million
More jails, less schools for the children
Invest in a penitentiary
Makin money off niggas like you and me
My God, it's the turn of the century
I wonder what the game got in store for me
Will it be a lotta seeds, my gees be free
Or be six feet deep on the day of release?
I can't stand it, lost in the game again
Will I win? Nobody knows in the end
I keep strugglin, pullin on the game of life
Try to stay on my toes, up on the edge of knife
I'm wakin up from the nightmares, who cares?
God, I heard death comin up the stairs
I got the past still hauntin me
Still knowin how my enemies want me
You never know when it's time to go
The blind lead the blind
If you don't know the game, get left behind
No love, hold up, what you thinkin of?
Youngsters on the corner goin dub for dub
You can't tell em, cause ain't nobody payin em mo'
Lost in the thug life, gone for sho'
Too many young players six feet in the flo'
As another one goes as modern-day hero

[ CHORUS ]

To other rappers that rose out the concrete, stay strong
Have faith in God, it won't be too long, hold on
Never lose faith in dreams
Watch the next people, they canive and scheme
A cold world, ghetto kids born to die
Some fall in the game without a chance to fly
In too deep, can't escape the drama
Too much drama for a young player, young timer
Pushed in the game at the age of 12
Hangin on the block, all about the mail
It's hard livin, somebody gotta lace the young
Before they get enough rope to leave theyself hung
Hardcore livin in the projects (projects)
Hustlers schemin for the profit (profit)
Mo' cash comes in and go fast
Toe-tags, dead homies in bodybags
Where it stops, nobody knows
I'm paranoid, is these enemies or foes?
Can't call it, sleep with a open eye
This world'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry
Stay real, keep a strong mind and strive
Cause what it boils down to is stayin alive

Since you was babies
And the world is yours, nigga you can have it all
But if you talk bad on this G ass nigga you'll take a fall, blaow
How many hoes want a nigga that get his ass kicked 
Car took, whupped and jacked ain't got no get back
I ain't the type to let no nigga jack me
Baby we cool if they run up on the Caddy

[Chorus: x2]

I'm off the Hennessy, when it's me she's callin' right back
I'm up in the Benzo on the mobile spittin' the game off the yack
I'm strapped with two blacks, 'cause I ain't the baller
Who be out there slippin'
She understands niggas be playa hatin' so she ain't trippin'
Saggy pants G-braids but nigga still out to get paid
I'm keepin' my mind up on my money and all my money is made
Shadetree niggas be tryin' to get in my mix
Conflicts, forty caliber cliques when I be burying tricks
She seen me knock niggas out now I do walk bys
Now I put faulty ass niggas between them chalk lines
See everybody be lookin' when I be bailin', trailin' indo smoke
See it ain't nothing but the smooth sailin'
And now I kick back and enjoy my riches on a sunny day
But sucka ass niggas be all up in my way
You're secure don't you worry bout a thang
I got these two twin glocks and when they cocked this is what they say

[Chorus: x2]",The Thug in Me
Spice 1,"[Chorus: x2]
So you want to be a playa 
So you want to be a G
So you want to be a gangsta (2nd time: player)
But you don't want to fuck with me

Diamonds up on the pinky rolexes up on the wrist
Take a good look at this old pimpin' ass 
Nigga you ain't never seen a Mack like this
It's the Thug in me 
Niggas be walkin' round muggin' me ruggin' me 
Tell your bitch to give me my dick back 
She pullin' me and tuggin' me
Can't be fuckin' round with you cluck head bitches 
Don't need no fixin' rubbers
Just like my timin' ass partner (E-)40 say 
Punk bitch y'all burn rubber
If that bitch can't swim then nigga she bound to drown
What's up with you old ratched mouth ass bitches 
Tryna talk down on me and the town
You bitches better recognize this is 187 proofer
Mobbin' out the cut with a fat A.K. and a black on black Lex Luther
Ain't no ? up in this ? just shut em down crush nasty
Right now I'm kickin' this pimp shit but you ho's know I'm the last G
In sticky situations will have bust with no hesitation
You punk ass niggas don't know my background 
You just stuck on that player hation
Why a nigga want to talk bad on a timer who been down from the Get Go
I can smoke a blunt up in my hot tub don't be trippin' off that old shit though

[Chorus: x2]

You niggas ain't never seen me in person tryna assassinate my character
Talkin' bout Spice ain't got no paper 
Bitch I'm a nightmare livin' in America
Ain't no paperbag ass nigga hoe I done been through some shit
Niggas walkin' round out here I want to kill 
Want to kill me too that's real
Punk ass niggas they know who they is runnin' round talkin' shit
Oh, fuck that punk ass nigga 
Spice 1 he ain't nothin but a bitch
But one of these days 
I'ma have your ass chopped up in the back of my Benzo
Mobbin' to this old gangsta shit right here smokin' on some of that Indo
Too many fuck you bitches up in the game niggas be puttin' too much on it
Born and bred to be a Thug ass nigga 
2 fingers on two twin Glock triggers
I know the game ain't got no rules and they got been laced
Damn, if so many muthafuckas didn't know my face
I would've been offin' you playa hatin' ass niggas a long time ago
Would've seen you filled up with slugs would've seen you dyin' real slow
But you know what I ain't trippin' off that old shit 
Cause y'all niggas ain't worth my riches
Go head and sit around and chatter my name out 
I lace more punk ass bitches

Spice 1,"Welcome to the ghetto

Livin' day by day in my hood on the spot
See the same old things:same dope fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner 
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been life this fo' years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5 
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin' each other's lives
And goin' to REST IN PEACE
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto 
My cousin died last year 
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein' dope fiends livin' off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""
But I don't slang or either gang-bang
And though my old school homies do the same thang
I still got love 'cause you gotta live
So you can give
And raise a family G
But you gotta do your best slangin D-O-P-E
So keep a grip on yourself and stay mellow
And welcome to the ghetto
(welcome hard up with it to my life) ?? 

[Chorus: x4]
Welcome to the ghetto 
(welcome hard up with it to my life) 

From across the seas comes cocaine
But you never seen a black man fly the plane
Look at the news:a young black death
Was it drug related,take a guess
I flash when I look in the mirror black
Cause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat 
I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody back stabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin'
Death gives a shit about your color
But yet I see mo dead young brothas
I'm goin' crazy out here
Seein' 24 brothas die by the end of the year
And I still gotta deal with the 5-0
And I stopped sellin' dope in 9-0
But if I came to it 
I probably still do it
Put a Nine in my draws get straight to it 
I hope that I never see the day  
That I get 20 years for a cake 
B-K-A as a key
So open up the door for the mo money
But I ain't gotta do that G
Cause I'm down with the F-A to the see to the you to the L-T-why
 G-nut X-tra Large and S-P-I-see-E make niggas feel like jello  
And welcome to the ghetto
(Welcome hard up with it to my life)

Spice 1,"Damn!
Standing here brings back a gang of memories, man
Sitting on this old block
All the violence and drugs you know
But I lived through it
Get this shit on, yeah nigga, you and them
Motherfuckers
Rest in player pieces my niggas
Blaaow!

Innocent bystanders be laying up in the streets
In the concrete jungle where real niggas be packing heat
Leaving your insides exposed to the witnesses walking by
Here today and gone tomorrow my nigga, we born to die
Keep your eyes open partner, ain't no rules in this shit
My nigga died with three kids and a wife, ain't that a bitch
I can't go clubbing because I'm thugging with some G's for real
I see some niggas at the party, then I'm subject to kill
Keep my head over the water, uzi in the stash
Niggas try to wet me up that's why I dumped on they ass
I had a homey named ?Money' now he's R.I.P
Niggas set him and killed him for some key's and g's
I don't know why they fuck did it, niggas plotting and scheme
That's why you can never be blind to a broke man's dream
Because see I'm losing it. I can't take it. I miss my peers 
Talk to my nigga, Makaveli. He's been dead for two years
Episodes of divine intervention, invade my mind
Got me thinking, damn I could've been dead, a couple times
Killer pits and extra clips, around my bed when I sleep
Stash my glock under my pillow, twenty gauge by my feet
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
For my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind

[Chorus: x2]
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
Put the fire to the blunt, take a sip of the Hen
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
On my homies dead, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

Too many niggas smile in my face and back stab
I'm left throwing niggas in the trunk and kidnap
Thugging and loving bitches obsessed with this mob shit
Niggas thinking they moving 
And bailing out the cut with the quickness
Suckers be blind to this real shit, we bring the pain
Bossalini, Fetty Chico, Shiznilti still in the game
Immortalized forever, having my homies up in the grave
Thinking back on when I used to drank yac in my younger days
Bust the twelve gauge shotty, too young to buy liquor
Little bad ass niggas grew up to be mob figures
Living life on a razor; cars, money and bitches
Niggas plotting to kill us, coming in coupes in a milli's
We go to war ?til they feel us, bury they ass on the realest
(not sure what is said) eliminate you for scrilla
Niggas dying on the frontline
Spending most of they life ducking the one time, no sunshine
In the world of sin, from the gutter to the pen
Got me swimming in the game with a brim on my shark's fin
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
For my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind

[Chorus]

I ain't no bitch but if you bone me I'm coming 
Running double trying to murder something
Eyes red and heart pumping
Serving niggas out the back of the Caddy 
Hitting corners, 
Ain't no love for you snitch ass niggas in California
Ducking suckers and shady bitches, scheming to gaffle riches
Niggas living fictitious, running game and selling fishes
Paranoia of surveillance vans watching me close
Nigga ? dreams died back in '94
Suckers laid down my homey, I just had to get off
Can't be acting like no bitch nigga, because war is raw
They say nice guys finish last and the good die young
Too many real niggas put to death by the hand of the gun
Sitting on my old block reminiscing again
On my homies dead and gone in the wind
Gone with the wind, Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind, gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

How many ballers you know that you makin' scrill with?
Haters be actin' like the game is gone

It's like Newport to G.P.C.
Generic haters get smoked quick up because they cheep
We yay deep like a shark I pull you under the water
Get you caught up in some thug (Shhhh)
Steady mobbin' and stackin' chips in the dirty Bay
Suit angles and hittin' switches thugs ain't your average
Marks just give up all they cabbage
See the big fish eat up the guppies
It's like real big dogs to little pound puppies
.22 to a .50 cal.(iber) got 'em curious

Robbin' banks when I was juvenile
I told my P.O. (parole officer) I wouldn't give him no drama

You can distract 'em with your cleavage

Kick on back with Spice 1 (spice 1)
Baby, you can ride shotgun (shotgun)
Little rings around your titty-nipples
While I'm puffin' on my blunt (my blunt)
Just some gangsta shit that I do (I do)
When I ride with me and you (me and you)
We alone in the middle of the night
Rubbin' my .44 between your thighs
You ain't scared it's the thug in me
Got your lips on my neck and you're huggin' me
Tinted bulletproof window so they can't see
Just a down-ass bitch and a hard-ass G
Ha ha ha ha

Feelin' on your ass while you're bustin' out the roof
Yellin' 187 out the stolen coupe (coupe)
Baby come and go on this lick with me
Born killers like ""Mickey"" and ""Malorie""
You in love with a fugitive
Po-po lookin' for me where I used to live
Ain't got no more jail time to give
B-a-B-a bomb first my prerogative
When I see your G-string in a hot tub
Clips and gats all around makin' hot love
And you're always down for a lil' sex , money and murder
Laids up with a reload the gun won't me to serve ya
Got you lost in a thug world 
Fully loaded magazine playin' with your pearl
Crystal kinda ? by the pool-side
Got two twin-Glocks, hers and his nines
Other hoes is fakin' you're the realest
When it come to nanana you got the illest
Got a nigga hittin' switches in the king-size
Me and you get dressed and goin' Hoo-ride
That's how we do it 
Some haters ?
Me and my bitch got you mark-ass niggas scared
If you don't comin' with the money she gon empty lead
Leave a nigga in a hooptie with a half-head

Whoever try to buy a new Benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? A big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the A, straight from the Bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin' half on my business, keep gettin' paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks

Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! poppin' Crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass
This's for my nigga Roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin

Now the taste of Crystal is fillin' up my bladder
What's the time on the rolie? It don't matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was tryin' to sort
To make a long story short,
Ran into this girl named Sally
Knew her from the backseat of my homeboy's Navi
She said what's up, yeah, what's the deal?
Check the nappy weave, of course it ain't real
Then I looked down, she was fat in the front
I asked how long, she said, ""About 6 months""
""Oh, how time flies when you're havin fun""
She said, ""Yeah, but the damage is done""
""Where you been?"" ""On a little vacation""
""Oh, by the way, congratulations
Who's the lucky man?"" She said, ""I got him on file""
Then she said, ""It's Spice 1"", and smiled
I dropped my stout, then everything went blank
""Had a baby by you, the neighborhood skank?""
She said, ""Yeah, don't you remember that day?""
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said, ""Damn, are you sure it's mine?
My homies did the Soultrain on ya plenty of times""
She said, ""That day, nah, I was whorin'
And your ass is mine"", that's when the sweat started pourin
Cause all I seen was Spice 1 up in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about givin up the fetti
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the belly
Nah, 'cause then I'd really be faded
That's murder one, 'cause it was premeditated
What should I do? Kidnap the bitch and flee?
How many months left? Damn, only 3
I'm gettin' faded

Goddamn, what the fuck I done got myself into?
This shit is dense

Damn, I'm gettin' faded

Muthafuckas tryin to take my driver's license and shit

Bitch, you can't fade me

This bitch got a grip on my mothafuckin' nuts, mayn

Damn, I'm gettin' faded

But you know?
I ain't finna go out

It's crazy, because before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge to try to creep with her
See, the booty in the front was all in place
But the girl had a pitbull face
So I ran, jumped, drove, swam, crawled, hid
Oh Lord, God forbid
The homies see me at the hotel
Cause I know they would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows you're nasty
Elbows and knees and feet was hella ashy
So hold the big fat butt steady
Cause yo, bitch, I got the three rubbers ready
She started gruntin and squeelin' like a wild bore
I hit the ass from Cali to Singapore
I dropped her off, man, and now I'm knowin'
That I'ma hate myself in the mornin'
I got drunk to help me forget
Damn, another day, another hit
Shit, I'm gettin' faded

No cigars, nigga

Damn, you can't fade me

You better fire up a mothafuckin' blunt and get some Hen-dog

9 months later she's ready to drop the load
And all the partners in the hood already know
That it's 'posed to be mine, and they laughin' at me
You know Spice 1 can't be havin' that, gee
thinkin' to myself: why did I bang her?
Now I'm in the closet lookin' for the hanger
Kaos, Vic Rock and ? won't let up
They won't shut up, I'm gettin' fed up
Cause I know, you're tryin to break me
And if I find out you're tryin to fade me
I'ma clock yo ass with my shoe
Beat you down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is gettin' kinda major
The baby came out, damn, it was a life saver
lookin' like my next-door neighbor
She said it was mine, that was her best guess
But let's check the results of the blood test
I started smilin, yeah, 'cause it read 'negative'
Damn, why did I let her live?
After that I shoula got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no, I just told the hoe who laid me
""Excuse me, bitch, it's a switch, you can't fade me""

Nah, bitch, it ain't even finna go down like that
A nigga like me ain't finna go for the okey-doke
The bitch out here thinkin' she get a muthafucka for his cash and shit
Playin' a muthafucka for some type of bitch-ass nigga

[ verse 1: too $hort ]
Whoever try to buy a new benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? a big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the a, straight from the bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin half on my business, keep gettin paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks
Let these gold-diggin bitches count my spokes

Havin ménage-? trois, x-ed out on the celly with todd
""short dog, what's up? "" he told me roger troutman passed
I hollered, my shit about to crash
Copped a block of hash, an ounce of grass
Damn! poppin crystal, poured me a glass
Then poured the whole rest of the bottle out on the flo' for yo' ass
This's for my nigga roger, the godfather of futuristic funk
Here's the ganja, get it crunk
Twist the skunk, hit it once
And keep that shit movin and
Thug niggas do what they want to, and busta niggas do what you're doin
I went from rags to riches, bagged bitches, jags and 6's
To droppin a solo album that's sellin more than the last shit did

I never knew you really comin' to this
You on my hit list, snug as a bug in the rug yo I lift this
Snicthin', bitchin' gave you everything I could
And just to think we grew up in the hood
It's all bad, you the only one who knew where the dope was stashed
Can't wait to see you motherfucker I'ma smoke your ass
Want to get the grain but the head to fetch ya
Payback is a mother motherfucker I bet'cha
You paid for the lock down subquantant facilities
Saw the homies who got snitched on
I know you feelin' me

Chrome dubs, only showin' love for thugs
Finger fuckin' my fo' five watchin' sparks from slugs
I'm a ill motherfucker, meanin' I'm sick in the game
I got the thug disease, fetty chico the name
When you can play in the dirty bay
But you better know how to swim (swim)
And get your ass ate the fuck up by the shark with the brim

Like gang writin' on the wall I'm x-ed the fuck out
Extra doubt, which niggas is next to check out?
I got a fo' five, ar and a couple of grenades
Twist ya ass up quick like french braids
It's the b and to the o and the s and to the s
And the I and to the l and the l and to the I
And the n and to the I, born to die
Four tay we ain't playin', let 'em know how we ride
Startin' with him, what you niggas think it's a joke?
I ain't cheech and four tay ain't chong
But you gettin' smoked

Blaow, how you like me now I'm on a rampage
Fully loaded mack 11, black twelve gauge
Live fo', bustin' at a swift tempo
Tried to told ya, leave your ass and limbo
Remember those crutches left at the phone nigga
Now it's on nigga (cause you a gone nigga)

[Chorus]

Leave you hollow or with flash or die from the gun blast
They can't see me in the beany or black ski mask
Body bags dumped in trash I'm like sideways
Yellow tape on the scene to the slaughter on the highway
My way or no way at all, it's like a pimp's ball
Thought I want it all, got a problem we can brawl
Cops bigger, did he figure he ready to war
Buck! one, two, three niggas on the (floor)

Gang draw, echo three blocks and four
Heard the motherfuckin' blast like it was right next door
Boom! fall out nigga you though you was hit
Take a puff of the blunt say mobb life's the shit
You see a nigga smash off in are-grey and a black six
It's the infamous fetty chico from the bay bitch

I makes the money, I don't let the money make me,
Business as good as usual 'cause it's a great street,
My life is like a see-saw, I had some good times and had some bad times

I slept in a pissy hallway til' my people came and got me,
Now a nigga ballin' and none of why'all won't top it,

Nigga you muthafuckin' right my 99 you could type,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I'm bout to paint it with stripes,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right it's see-M-are for life,
Nigga you muthafuckin' right I slit your throat with a knife,

What you really needs to be doin' is peepin' out my background,
Before I stop you from playin', with this blat-blat sound,
Nigga what's happenin' with you, what's up with your boys?
Tell them lil' muthafuckas to stop talkin' that noise,

When a nigga came bustin' at me and runnin' with that nine,

And if I bust back and cause casualties then it'll be sweet,

Been in this for four years,

And ain't no nigga up in this city that can tell me bout mine,
See you blind bruh, talkin' about these diamonds I'm bout to get,

But what I'm bouts to get, 
ain't got a DAMNED thing to do with this shit,
See I live here, you live there, we all live fair,
Talkin' about that Sharp clique, and Ca$h Money,

See you done bought you some fight, 
and you done made it most of the night,
So the next thing, you gonna come around here and murder me tonight?

They got they muthafuckin' mind on me, they tryin' to be,

The one and only, mutherfucker to stop,
This here, what I'm doin', I ain't never had shit,
So I ain't gone let you ruin,

And nigga ain't talkin' bout nothin' bitch what the fuck you mean?

Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just because it is the season 
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left from last year 
World tour, aeroplanes and babies. 
Met some guys but never the time 
Most of 98 was along those lines. 

So deck the halls and trim those trees
Raise up the cups of christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath 
Christmas with my mates this year

Calendar picture
Frozen landscape
Chill this room for twentyfour days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back to spring time, 
Sunny again
Would have been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree when we were both free 
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch, 
We didn't of course till the summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him 
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
And of course I am excited
Tonights the night but I've set my mind 
Not to do too much about it.

Merry Christmas Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year

But I think I'll miss this one this year

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight 
Last minutes have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls 
Because it's are S V P 
No thanks, no party lads 
It's christmas eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites 
Last fall I had a night to myself
Some guy called halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go 
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late 
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quite way I unwind, 
Doing christmas right this time 

Merry Christmas Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas
But I think I'll miss this one this year

Tesco has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot 
So it's on with the boots back out in the snow 
To the army all night garage but when to my wondering eyes should appear 
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
Spending this one alone he said
Give me a break this years been crazy 
I said me too, but why are you... 
You mean you forgot the papers too 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening
Christmas magic's brought this down to a very happy en-ending.

Do you still remember, how we used to be
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun
Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes I still remember, every whispered word
The touch of your skin, giving life from within
Like a love song that I'd heard
Slippin' through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
Has reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

And the secret's safe with me

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

His eyes would undress ev'ry maid in the house
Perhaps he is better described as a louse
But still people came just the same
He'd smile on the bar to the people below

While she spent her time the with the circuses freaks
The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
Alas and alack and Alaska
I went to this fellow the blackguard and said 
I'll see that you get your deserts
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer  
He sneered once again and said ""Nortz"" Oh!
 
He floats thro' the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
One night to his tent he invited her in 
Filled her with compliments and kisses and gin
That started her off on the road to ruin 
She made the supreme sacrifice
But even tho' I loved her I said ""Take my name  
I'll gladly forgive and forget!""
She rustled her bustle and then without shame she said
""Maybe later , not yet""!  Oh!

And my love he has stolen away
 
One night I as usual went to her dear home
Found there her father and mother alone 
I asked for my love and soon t'was made known
To my horror that she'd run away
Without any trousseau she fled in the night 
With him with the greatest of ease
From two stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze!
 
He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
The daring young man on the flying trapeze
His actions are graceful, all girls he does please 
And my love he has stolen away
 
Some months after that I went into the hall 
To my surprise I found there on the wall
A bill in red letters which did my heart gall 
That she was appearing with him
He'd taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights 
To help him to live at his ease
He'd made her assume a masculine name 
And now she goes on the trapeze!
 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease

That same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine.

That same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride.
Down and down I go.
Round and round I go.
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.

I stay away. Oh what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame.
A flame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire. 

For you're the lover I've been waiting for.
The mate that fate had me created for.
And every time your lips meet mine

Round and round I go.

Watch it count down to the end of the day

And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so

Hear the voice that makes me whole

While I will wait, she was early
Was her God there to let her know
She can hear me
It burns my eyes

She can hear me hush, hush
She can hear me
Nothing dies
She can hear me hush, hush

Closed her eyes, looked like morning
Silver hair and darkened smile
She loved with her eyes, left without warning
Had I known, I'd have said goodbye

She can hear me
Burns my eyes
She can hear me hush, hush
She can hear me, nothing dies

Spirit of the West,"I was tired of being put right down
By myself for not being what you
Thought you had found
Pulled hard in two directions by a
Desire to learn
And my old affections

When I tried to share my world with you
You could not seem to tolerate
The people I had grown to love
They shrank under your scrutiny,
Became the ones you'd hate

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?

I was feeling a little underwhelmed
About hanging around with you and
Feeling over cautious
Every word, every little look, every little sigh
Every little phrase
Put me deeper in your doghouse

You'd let me out to run across your world
I ran into a wall you told me I built it
Then you'd reel me in, ream me out, pick me up
Push me out again
And then repeat it

Why did everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything with you and me was

Too busy tripping on my tongue
To try and stand my ground
And I can still see myself crying in your lap
Asking you, are you happy with the man you have found?

I'm grateful for what you did for me
I can see things now I never would have seen
And today I thought about what could have been
But could never be for you and me

'Cause everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me had to be so political
Everything, every little thing
Every little thing
With you and me have to be so political?
Everything, everything
With you and me was so political

Spirit of the West,"I was sitting in Bazil's with a friend and coffee
Thinking the world a fine place to be
When the man on my right got up to leave
And left a piece of his mind with me

He said, ""faggots like you should be put in asylums""
Tell me, who takes the blame
For his being scared, so unaware
That he'd fire his fear without an ounce of shame

Whatever happened to love thy neighbor?
Nothing more than a worn out cliché
Are all men created equal or has this too become passé?
You don't need to open your mouth for me to read your lips
I can follow the language displayed on your finger tip

They don't look before they leap
And they don't think before they speak
They just sharpen their tongues on you and me
Spit poison darts between perfect teeth

You've got to take it from the source
And look at where it's coming from
You're got to take it from the source
They're only wasted words on me

I guess I just don't measure up
Strayed from the straight and narrow road
So you lock me up, throw away the key
'Cause I don't live by your dress code

Well that's okay, I've heard it before
You can open the wound I feel no pain
I don't need an armor suit
'Cause you're the one with the ball and chain

And they don't look before they leap
And they don't think before they speak
They just sharpen their tongues on you and me
Spit poison darts between perfect teeth

You've got to take it from the source
And look at where it's coming from

Spirit of the West,"Well, we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well it all began one afternoon on the shores of Ambleside,
We were sittin' there quite peacefully with the rising of the tide;
When an idea it came to mind for to usher in the Fall,
And we all agreed next Friday night we'd go out on the crawl

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well we planned to have a gay old time, the cash we did not spare,
We left all the cars at home and paid the taxi fare;
I got out to Horseshoe Bay a little after five,
From a table in the corner I heard familiar voices rise

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Well spirits they ran high that night, old stories we did share,
Of the days when we were younger men and never had a care;
And the beer flowed like a river and we drank the keg near dry,
So we drained down all our glasses and were thirsty by-and-by

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

Park Royal Hotel, The Rusty Gull, Square-Rigger and Queen's Cross,
We'd started out with eight good boys but half had gotten lost;
And you'll never keep the lads together when their eyes begin to rove,
And there was just the three of us that made it to Deep Cove

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

We arrived out at The Raven just in time for the last call,
The final destination of this the first annual crawl;
We dug deep into our pockets there was no money to be found,
Nine miles home and for walking we are bound

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,
Drinkers and carousers the likes you've never seen;
And this night, by God! We drank till there was no more,
From the Troller to the Raven with all stops in between

And we're good old boys, we come from the North Shore,

In the strangest places
Behind the door, on the floor
A cabinet full of empty faces

Running through the ranks
Loss of faith, loss of face
Captain will you walk the plank
Let's give him a push this time
Give him a push this time
It's hard to care who's clinging to the reins
When the horse keeps pulling lame
Pulling lame pulling lame
Pulling figures from your sleeve

Spirit of the West,"Jesus hangs behind the glass
Above Venetian doors
His window box boasts crimson flowers
Fresh cut the day before

And you couldn't find a smile
If you nailed it to his face
But Jesus Christ hangs his head with grace

And if Venice is sinking
I'm going under
'Cause beauty's religion
And its Christened me with wonder

They come in bent-backed
Creaking 'cross the floor all dressed in black
Candles, thick as pillars
You can buy one off the floor
And the ceiling's painted gold
Mary's hair is red
The old come here to kiss their dead

And if Venice is sinking
I'm going under
'Cause beauty's religion
And its Christened me with wonder

We made love upon a bed
That sagged down to the floor
In a room that had a postcard on the door
Of Marini's Little Man
With an erection on a horse
It always leaves me laughing
Leaves me feeling that of course if

Venice is sinking
I'm going under
'Cause beauty's religion
And its Christened me with wonder

Are the hands that once caressed me

Or beg for mercy from above

But he never left his bed
On his birthday after brandy
He chose angel choirs instead

In a rocking chair with a cigarette

Spirit of the West,"In the shadow of Modigliani
The German punkers lie
Each with a dog, on a bit of string
And filling half the sky
The Koln Cathedral offers calm
And quiet expectations
And then Elvis lit a candle on my day of revelations

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down on Ascension day

Didn't know how many steps, enough to make me sweat
I pressed my face against the screen
To be closer to the wind
The climb left stone, for iron stairs
That ended short of heaven
And it seemed the perfect place for prayer
On the day of my ascension

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in, pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down on Ascension day, Ascension day

Drifted through a door
To a room reserved for prayer
Grateful for the silence
I turned my thoughts to you
And they landed on your body
As they very often do
Wingtips fanned and stretched
For the guilding on the dome
I lit a prayer on borrowed flame
And sent my love back home, home

Threw out a wish on a long piece of string
Felt a gentle tug and then pulled it in, pulled it in
Kept it in my hand 'til I reached the ground
Climbed up, brought it down

Drunk on your own reflection
Propped up with desks and flags,
Eight chairs short of perfection

Shat on you're beyond defeated

Then treat you roughly once they're seated

Your pen in one, the sword in the other
Satisfied the blessing is given
In God they trust only their way one way
Afraid of the other isms

Not what God had made a child of His to be

I'm afraid that he'll amount to all of nothing
The joy of reading Yates he'll never know
And in the rat race twirl of our computer guided world
He stands no chance of winning let alone to place or show

Two peas in a pod
Two of a kind
They'd never have to ask each other, ""What is on your mind?""

It seemed a simple way to make him happy
And happy's such a simple way to be

Far enough to make excuses

And we can all be happy here in ours
And we can still help out
Even go as far as to stop off at the Safeway drop some pennies in the jar

So lock her up

Mrs. Jones is not like you or me
Lock her up, tight

Show us that we're wrong and that's the one thing we can't be

I'd bite the hand that slaps me senseless
But my patience is too relentless
I am far too Canadian
I am far too Canadian
I am the face of my country
Experssionless and small
Weak at the knees, shaking badly
Can't straighten up at all
I watch the spine of my country bend and break
I'm a sorry state
I scratch the walls, to mark the days
With my coup d e (tête), I'm locked away
With Mother Jones, pots of tea
The kitchen poster, anarchy
I never march in demonstrations
I hold my breath for arbitration
I am far too Canadian
I am the face of my country
Experssionless and small
Weak at the knees, shaking badly
Can't straighten up at all
I watch the spine of my country bend and break
I'm a sorry state

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.

I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

Seems so strange to waste your life that could bring so much
Blinded by fake you rush right into the failiure trap
Bitter blood reveals
You keep kissing the strings of hope
You pray to keep them warm
But somehow you always wake up cold
I know its hard to breake away from here
But you've got to lean on dreams to make them real
Money ain't all that counts when the day is done
Harmony is not something you buy
But keep on raping yourself you fake
You ain't got the guts to change
Poison yourself 'cause you're scared to loose, what!
",Picking from the Box
Spiritual Beggars,"When the day is over
And I've fed my kama
When ""...the wind cries Mary""
...Lingers on
Feels like I'm walking in water
Anguished water
With twisted emotions
I drink my wine
When th eday is over
I feel confused mum
Wish I could be happy
Wish I could put trust in love
Red wine on my tongue
Good feelings linger on
I kiss the naked wind of love
With sour stains on my heart
When the day is over
And I've fed my kama
Fear sneaks up on me
Wondering who am I
",Sour Stains
Spiritual Beggars,"Bad karma, bad life
Magic wonders is a horse without a head
No sign of hope, my soul miss home
Pills and booze become my lullaby
I'm singing to you
Don't give me your truth
Divine woman, blackhearted lady
Tenderness turns to a holy mess
Sense of chaos, a broken song
Find myself in the worse mess I've been
Bad karma, bad life
Magic wonders ain't made for you and me
But inside charmers make me breathe
They tell me stories of why I have to bleed
",Bad Karma
Spiritual Beggars,"Echos from a sweating sky
My fingers dancing 'cause I'm a liar
Beyond the mountains I gaze a jewel
Behind my eyes its June
Broken morning tears drop cold
My throat kiss pills of gold
Sad sun watch clouds make love
Sad soul watch me get stoned
",Broken Morning
Spiritual Beggars,"Power up the electric lady
Lick her spasmic skin
Stick one finger into her mouth
Wet her up for a carneval
Let luna set fire to our souls
Red wine won't escape our tounges
Kiss scars of yesterday goodbye
Let the romance kick off
Our minds are cristal clear
Don't mind the silver lace
There's no limit for souls in love
Cosmic romance kick off
",Cosmic Romance
Spiritual Beggars,"The sun is high and so am I
The plant in the hole starts to rise
Thoughts of the moon rotating in the room
I'm floating down a river without you
Smoke me baby, boil my soul
Let your wet pieces warm my bones
Ocean wide smell of freedom
Ocean wide taste of joy
I'm thirsting for euphoria
I'm drowning in this ocean of doubts
I'm fighting with my phobia
I'm thirsting for euphoria
Planets circulate around our heads
Listen carefully and you hear them say
Life is love and together we are God
Hold me tight, warm my bones, take me home
",Euphoria
Spiritual Beggars,"Someone bring me the wine!
Well you know, know what you came for
Are you still blinded by hate
Well I try and I do understand you
Never met a woman that hasn't betrayed me
You sit and you wait by the phone
You sure gonna gun down that whore
Well I try and I do understand you
Never me a woman that hasn't betrayed me
Someone bring me the wine!
Well you did, you did what you came for
Said it was a voice in your head
Well I try and I do understand you
But can't you tell a demon from a friend
",Homage to the Betrayed
Spiritual Beggars,"You see me as a looser
You see me as a clown
You see me as a drinker
Well I see you as a whore
She runs after signs
She runs with a lie
She said she needed space
But that was just an excuse to run away
I had swallowed too much pain
I had to ventilate some hate
Amongst sissy pop-rock stars
My fist started to talk
",Lack of Prozac
Spiritual Beggars,"I've ended the vision of being sane
Tucked the image into bed
I'm sweating denials from the tip of my tongue
You wouldn't belive this nation of pills
Shaking water, my head in a haze
Taste me baby, but you can't save my head
Bring a cup of mushroom tea
Take a swim inside of me
",Mushroom Tea Girl
Spiritual Beggars,"Fine woman won't you buy me another drink
I'm broke but not tired
You can pour all your problems on me
Smoke queen mama kiss me so sweet
Licker King papa make me feel free
Take me away baby
Let us loose ourselves
Fine Lady will you sail away with me
Let's climb to the top of my magic tree
We're getting bye baby
Just buy me another pint of hell
Take my hand baby
We'll find a better way
You're such a sad looking Lady
Come onboard, join the show
",Sad Queen Boogie
Spiritual Beggars,"Nominate myself for what I want to achieve
Form my surroundings in relation to the seed
Smiles swims in a muddy breath
Thirsting pulsating blood
What else can I do, than to feed me with a bigger thirst
But I wonder why tears run dry
Mind control
Well I think I've lost mine
Let's climb the holy mountain
And eat the stars
Under the wisdom tree
We'll drink the weeping grass
I need my fire drug
To feel the flood
I'm selfdestructive baby
But a friendly one
You better leave me here alone
I need this night to heal my world
Send me a smile and I'll get bye
But let me drink my wine tonight
Too late to turn back pages
Ambush, a part of my life
Nowdays the sun won't shine
'cause like my head, its lost in a cloud
My heart is broken baby
But still it's pounding
Too long with pills and booze
My short-memory ain't what it should
",Send Me A Smile
Spiritual Beggars,"[Instrumental]



",Superbossanova
Spiritual Beggars,"She shone like the sun in those days
Whispered things into my head
Now I lie cold in my cell
Kissing pils to keep me sane

Angel of betrayal
Nowadays I like to meditate
With a couple of drinks
Sitting on my sofa

Watching a dumb TV
Gin and Tonic rules
Blood on the floor
Burn marks from cigarettes

My throat pleads for more
I tried to put my tongue into the cave
I prayed that
I was insured

I tried to put my tongue into the cave
But she led my mind astray
Angel of betrayl
I ought to kill the bitch

To clean out of my head
Letting off some steam
If you know what I mean
Gin and Tonic rules

Blood on the floor
Burn marks and everything
Her soul leaves for home",Angel of Betrayal
Spiritual Beggars,"Loaded as the sun above
I dig myself
Drinking washes the gray away
It kissed my brain
Smoking makes me catch my breath
I feel alone
Now I feel my inner self
Incarnation of Christ
Now the lungs of the universe
Are the lungs of my soul
I can feel it
I can sense it
Hallelujah Bless my soul
Monday morning you enter hell
Not me I'm not a fool, no I'm not a whore
Haven't sold my soul
Monday morning I open a beer
And light a cigarr
Put my pen to paper and write I hate you all



",Blessed
Spiritual Beggars,"He took me away
He showed me a way
The rivers where running too slow
The wizard said ""This is your name
Eternal Gladiator, my friend""
Higher and higher and higher I fly
Escaping the circle of clowns
With magic wisdom
With magic eyes
I'm eating the stars and the Moons
I'm going home
And guess what?
I'm not dead
Yes, I'm going home
Freedom is the name of my soul
Faster and faster and faster
I speed I'm beating the light
With my eyes I find thousands of universes
Inside every single atom



",Escaping the Fools
Spiritual Beggars,"Said she's from another world
I said, ""I know what you mean""
I gave her a little more red wine
Our dreams came up for air
Messengers from beyond
Future plans and history
I caught a little cloud
My semen took off
Yeah Baby!
You make me high, make me fly
Make me king of life
You shake the earth, shake the dirt
And we dance into the sun
Sacred words appear
Questions solved and we are gods
The goddess is for real



",The Goddess
Spiritual Beggars,"He's never been arrested once
In his life
Never received a letter from the law
Quite insane
Never felt the demon riding his back
He is safe from harm
Never got hallucinations after
Being too long on the booze
Logical thinking
Turns to Stupidity
Never had longer relations
With the female sex
Never been quite all alone
Poor little boy
Never had suicidal thoughts
Never quite understood
The true meaning of the word life



",Left Brain Ambassadors
Spiritual Beggars,"Talk Into the blind zone - hiding
Cold as the moon now - freezing
We live in the shadows - with blindfolds
We die in the shadows - regretting
We didn't take the chance
Into the blind zone - bleeding
Cold as the moon now - we are freezing
While fire burns away
Take a trip into your magic soul
You'll find you've lived a thousand times
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt into the sun
Gaze into the centre of yourself
Left brain people never find this path
They stand there wondering
How anyone can be so naive
To search with
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Gaze into the centre of your dream
Fell the magic rhythm take you away
Let the magic talk and ride away
With no feeling of doubt into the sun
Over and over
Breathe magic rhythm
Over and over
Let the magic talk



",Let the Magic Talk
Spiritual Beggars,"I've been down so long
Nothing ever changes
No matter how much I try
Got neighbours in my head
They're constantly arguing
About each step I take
My hands move like rattlesnakes
And my fingers fumble
Like they've just been invented
I bleed through the faking truth
I don't understand
All you fools
I keep drinking wine
Alone in the dark
You know the last drink
Is always the saddest
I have enough pills
To take me home
'cause this neighbour's song is doing it too slow



",Mantra
Spiritual Beggars,"On dark rivers we float
Never to meet the releasing sea
Our souls hide
Deep inside our bodies
We got to feed our dreams
Nurse our dreams
Sounds of words that are spoken
Merely flirting with the truth
But we never find it
Never can we put the finger on it
Under a bad moon
We try to figure out
Which way to fall In this masquerading boat
You've got to wonder
Why most of us
Choose to stay



",On Dark Rivers
Spiritual Beggars,"Looking up from an icy spot
Praying for the re-birth of the sun
If everything would explode
Would you breathe in or out?
Bring me a dog or a loaded gun
I'm fed up with all the people around
Most of them are to me
Like crisp breadcrumbs in my bed
And all I can say to you Is to fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you is try!
Passive thinking, stuck in the game
Souls hide in infected cells
If everything would explode
Would they breathe in or out?
Stranded, deep in civilisation
People I thought were like myself
Have turned into what we all once said
We hated so much
And all I can say to you
Is that fly with the riddle
To touch the moon
All I can say to you
Is that I try



",Per Aspera Ad Astra
Spiritual Beggars,"Let me sing for pleasure
Let me drink my treasure
Up to the mountain of faith
Hit me again
While you kiss your left brain
You oppress you right brain
Ice-pops up in your arse
You run with the flock
Our presence is a saga
A shore beyond
The horizon
Save Your Soul
When I read Bukowski
And when I read Martinus
I feel magic in my soul
Boiling me warm
Do you dream of freedom?
Or do the demons tell you?
There is nothing you can loose
If you run with the flock
I'm too cool
To be a fool



",Save Your Soul
Spiritual Beggars,"Sedated every night
I had my wine and my joints
A couple of sleeping pills
Tears of tiredness dripping down
But after a while
I began to lose my song
After a while It wasn't fun no more
Sedated when morning comes
Sitting with a troubled head
Sedated but the sun don't shine
Await my suicide



",Sedated
Spiritual Beggars,"Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I've been
I'm back in the hazy woods
I hear the mountains bark
Until the morning comes
I'll rest my head in my arms
Until the morning line I stay awake
I see no point in
Staying sane I sell my days to keep
My demons in control
I'm galloping towards death
I'm not apologising, not begging
When you reach knowledge
You will understand



",Until the Morning
