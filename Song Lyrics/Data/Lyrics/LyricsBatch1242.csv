The Springfields,"A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.",The Green Leaves of Summer
The Springfields,"Breakaway, my heart is cryin' 
Breakaway, the time is flyin'

I'll take me round from town to town 
I'll see the friends I knew 
I left 'em by the wayside

Far away over the sea
Those far away places with the strange sounding names are
Calling
Calling me
Goin' to China or maybe Siam
I wanna see for myself 
Those far away places I've been reading about in a 
Book that I took from a shelf
I start getting' restless whenever I hear the whistle of a train

As we lay where no one saw us
On and on our lips together
Each one hoping that the other felt the same

Though now you're gone and summer's passed
The echoes of our love will last
Seasons change and time erases
Other people, other places, you remain

Our days were days of love and laughter
Keeping joyful memories after
You had gone and laughed no longer
Love was strong but time was stronger, so it seems

The secret places that we discovered
Now when winter's rains have covered
Still I find my heart will free you
As I lay to sleep I see you in my dreams

He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night

They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them

North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know

And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I'll run away with thee

No I'll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best

And I have no wings to fly
I'll just get some blue-eyed boatman

I'll help someone in time of need
And journey on with rapid speed

There's where I roamed for many long years
There's where my heart's been tending most ever
That's where the first step of misfortune I made

I was about thirty years when I courted and married
Amanda Gilbraith I then called my wife
But her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three months later I'd taken Tom's life

For twenty five years this whole world I rambled
I went to old England to France and to Spain
But I thought of my home way back in Roan Country
I boarded a steamer and came back again

I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in the county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next morning
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard

When the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin
And sister she sat alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was Willie God bless you
Was Willie God bless you, God bless you, good bye

Sweet Martha was grave but Corey was better
There's better and worse, although you can see
Boys when you write home from the prison in Nashville
Place one of my songs in your letter for me

Our hearts were gay and happy then 
You whispered to me as I held your close 
You hoped this night would never end

I wouldn't let my dear Savior in

The Stanley Brothers,"Oh it's raining, raining, raining here this morning
As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name

Many a little raindrops are falling close to me
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be
It's raining, raining, raining here this morning
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea

How I wish that I could see my little darling
And hold her in my arms just as before
I used to tell her every day I loved her
But now she doesn't love me anymore

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime
And said that she'd be waiting there for me
But she has found somewhere else to wander
Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning
And I am just as weary as can be
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea

But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty
So I will have to suffer all the shame
Go and tell her for me little raindrops
That they've given me a number for my name

Take Jesus as your daily guide

At the ending of your pilgrim way

You'll surely need him on that day

And in his precious love abide

Never ever let it stray

I often hang my head and cry

Makes me wish that I could die.

With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
She's a courting some other man

Oh how can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
A shining in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

Last time a saw little Maggie
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

When a voice from the tomb seemed to say

Seemed to say in a low gentle tone
Oh how sweet (oh how sweet) is the rest (is the rest)

And I thought as I looked on those cold marble slabs

And in silence I stood by her tomb
And her voice seemed to say in a low gentle tone

The Stanley Brothers,"Friends this is a true story that happened in the hills of western North Carolina in the year 1928.  This tragedy occured near the little town of Danburry in Stokes county in the state of North Carolina.  It's absolutely true.  This man murdered his family, his wife, and himself.  His name was Charlie Lawson, and this song is entitled, ""The Story of the Lawson Family.""

It was long last Christmas evening
The snow was on the ground
At his home in North Carolina
The murderer, he was found

His name was Charlie Lawson
And he had a loving wife
But they never knew what caused him
To take his family's life

They say he killed his wife at first
While the little one did cry
Please papa won't you spare us
How it is so hard to die

But the raging man could not be stopped
He would not heed their call
He kept on firing fatal shots
And there he killed them off

They say he killed his wife at first
While the little ones did cry
Please papa won't you spare us
How it is so hard to die

They did not carry him to jail
No lawyers would be paid
They'll have his trial in another land
On the final judgement day

They all were all buried in a crowded grave
While the angels watched from above
Come home, come home my little ones
To the land of peace and God

And... farewell ...
I'll see you there no more
But when we meet in another land
Our trouble will be gone

With pearly blue eyes and with chestnut brown hair
She promised to love and said she's be mine
But I went away leaving her there behind

I'll tell you the reason why I left her there
To roam this old world with its sorrow and cares
I saw her one night in the arms of a man
Hugging and kissing as true lovers can

I went to my home with a heart full of woe
Packed my belongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam
With thoughts of my sweetheart my darling my own

While dining one day in a little country town
A stranger came in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine

Now I am the man who you saw that fateful night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She waited so long for the day you'd return
And why you had left her she never did learn

She loved you so dearly but you broke her heart

And I destroyed that poor boy's soul

And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl's neck

So put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that freight car gate

No-one for to go my bail

So pass around that old long necked bottle
And we'll all go on a spree

There's sorrow in my heart
I hate to say goodbye my dear

Won't you let me be your friend

Does your mind wander back to the past?
Do you think of the love you've forsaken?
Darlin' true love is too sweet to last

Do you realize the heartache you've caused me
You should know that my love was so true

Does your mind wander back to the past?
Do you think of the love you've forsaken?

To the times when I was free
As I played before the fireside
'Round my darling, mother's knee

There's a blessed home up yonder
Where my loved ones wait for me
I saw mother in a vision
Kneeling there to pray for me

Then one day our mother left us
Daddy said she'd gone to rest
I remember how she loved me
As she clutched me to her breast

There's a blessed home up yonder
Where my loved ones wait for me
I saw mother in a vision
Kneeling there to pray for me

Oh, bring back to me, my wandering boy
For there is no other that's left to give me joy
Tell him his mother with faded cheeks and hair
Is at the old home, awaiting him there

Out in the hallway there stands a vacant chair
Had an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty now the cradle, he used to love so well
Oh, how I love him, no tongue can tell

Oh, bring back to me, my wandering boy
For there is no other that's left to give me joy
Tell him his mother with faded cheeks and hair
Is at the old home, awaiting him there

Are you the girl I used to know?

Like a wild rose on the hill

Far across this barren land
Thinking of that peaceful village
Where we once strolled hand in hand

When our journey here has ended
And this life on earth is done

Saw a young man kneeling there
In his hand there were some roses 
On his lips there was a prayer
On a stone these words were written

When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet, my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
chorus
If I could only hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her, tender voice as then
How happy I would be, ?would mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again

Within the old home place, her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear

She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting in His love I seek that home above.
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day.

Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she is now at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me
To that eternal home of peace and love

but I've heard enough lies and you're dying to get caught. 
I'll let you go call all your friends. 
""Oh my god! Let me describe to you this guy,
his name is Ken, he's in this band that writes such, 
awful songs about me all the time.""

Fine, just let me lie here for a while,
'Cause I'll be staying up, yeah hanging up all night.
Oh, I'm spent with all intentions (of your bit?).
To a hopeless case, to a sharp headache, to a choice you make
To the reason why I, to the reason why I say.

[Chorus:]
I'll be your friend in hell, until then I despise you. 
And I probably always will. 
I can't afford to make another mistake like you.

About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansions waiting on the hills with crystal chandeliers
Then there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me

Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own I never had a home
And a eighteen year old boy has got to eat
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose
This bed of Rose's that I lay on where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living is the only kind of life I'll understand

She was a handsome woman just thirty-five who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business like most of the town wished they could do
I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of I suppose
She died knowing someone really loved her from life's bramble bush I picked a rose

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans

Pulled my ol' har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
Blowed it low while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whipers slapping time and Bobby clapping hands
We finally sang up every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free, so free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Body that was good enough for me, good enough for me and Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Searching for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' her body close to mine

The Statler Brothers,"Everything that I see since I moved far away
Only serves to upset and remind me
Of a beautiful girl in a part of the world
That I tried to leave far behind me

Like the girl on the street that I happened to meet
As I was about to walk past her
She looked just like her and my heart felt a stir
So I stopped her and proceeded to ask her

What are you doin' in this part of the world
Oh, forgive me but I thought you were someone else
For a moment you looked like a girl
That I came here to forget but you see I haven't yet
And I won't in this part of the world

Every car on the road's like the one that she drove
Makes me think that she's come to meet me
In this part of the world, just the sight of that girl
Would relieve me and cure me completely

And it happened today in the very same way
When a car just like her's pulled beside me
With a beautiful girl, so I called out to her
""Hello dear, how on earth did you find me?""

What are you doin' in this part of the world
Oh, forgive me but I thought you were someone else
For a moment you looked like a girl
That I came here to forget but you see I haven't yet
And I won't in this part of the world

The Statler Brothers,"We walked the warm streets of Florida with sand in our pockets lots of times
Worked the cold streets of New York with four guitars and a tin cup just for dimes
We spent one night in Winnipeg a summer in Mississippi sun
Had some trouble once in Fargo some bad times in Enceno but we had fun

We made the papers once in Phoenix when we stopped and tried to break up a fight
We hit keno in Reno and lost it all in Vegas the very next night
We hopped a train in Chicago and skinny dipped in San Francisco bay
We checked it all in the big hotels then used the fire escape to get away

And we wouldn't trade it all for the world and all of its gold
It's the past that makes the future worth livin'
Mother Luck's been good to us and we will praise her in our songs
For the good times and the good things she has given

We flew into Kansas City early April 24th without a plane
We got stranded in a snow storm with some girls from Salt Lake City on a train
We spent a week one night in LA looking for a doctor's daughter on the strip
Then we wound up in Nashville pitchin' songs and waitin' tables for a tip
And we wouldn't trade it all...

I wonder if they pray for the boy who went away

You could almost see the fields of blue grass green
You could almost hear them cry as they kiss their boy goodbye

The Statler Brothers,"It was in the high school yearbook dated may of '55
We were voted the couple most likely to survive
Even teachers never doubted we were more than just friends
But your mama had some second thoughts back then

When you went off to nursing school I kept my job in town
To show your folks that I was old enough to settle down
When you came home for holidays we were happy without sin
But your mama had some second thoughts again

Does your mama know I'm rich and happy well almost that is
Has she ever said that maybe she was wrong
All she ever really wanted was to have the best in you
And that's all I ever really wanted too.

Thanks to her she made me want to prove I could succeed
But thanks to her I'll never have the one thing that I need
And If she reads the papers and remembers who I am
She's probably having seconds again

Does your mama know I'm rich and happy well almost that is

But how long will it stay there will that love light grow dim
You can just see the happiness you can't see the tears
It's true cause you're living in your tender years
If I can't be your first love I'll wait and be your last

Taught me how to swim and fish and tell the difference between bass and carp
Taught me how to snap my fingers whistle through my teeth oh Uncle Roy
He sure took time to make times good for a little pesty half grown boy
Aunt Kathleen would wash my clothes and blow my nose whenever nature called
Darn my socks and damn the pox but kept me out of school from fall to fall
Gave me movie money though I never did my chores the way I should
To a nasty little nephew Kathleen you sure made aunthood awful good
And Freddy used to laughed to me whenever something valuable got broke
He taught me how to climb a tree about birds and bees and taught me how to smoke
He took me on a first date I was scared to death but he said you'll do fine
Good buddy you're my cousin but you seem more like a brother of mine
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Roy's all crippled up now Kathleen can hardly see
Freddy's off somewhere to fight a war
But you can't go home to the good times you can't go home anymore
Everything has changed and who were there to blame
Gone far that you just can't go home

Looking back I'd say I had the best childhood that money just can't buy
And I owe it all to free good folks who took me in when mom began to die
They always told me son just do what's right and you'll be proud just wait and see
Well Roy and Kathleen I'm only proud that you're the ones who's proud of me

He did were never done for show
His name was never printed in the paper
Until about two days ago

He only filed a short form for his taxes
No one asked him how he felt about the war
He always had a good word for his neighbor
Now his good words won't be heard anymore

And through the rain, I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee

His table was never full of plenty
His silverware was never the real thing
But the tears on the faces of his family
Were just as real as if he been a king

Preacher said, he'd always been a good man
But preachers always throw that phrase around
But the tears I tasted gave his words new meaning
Watching old friends puttin' daddy in the ground

And through the rain, I heard the choir singing
""Nearer my God to Thee""
Through the mist I saw some children crying
And I felt nearer my God to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee

Took the good, good life for granted
Thought the better things were handed out for free

Does require a bit of giving
And some things that I'd been missing now I see

To lend a helping hand
I'm not perfect
But I've learned a lot since then

There were times when I thought surely
I'd find riches in a hurry
And become the judge and jury of my time
And the life I thought so splendid
Turned before me to be mended
Placing realms where I intended not to climb

And the world that used to fall in step
Beneath my guiding hands
Is still turning

To make people want to stop all this fussing and fighting
Long enough to sing along

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

Music is love and love is music if you know what I mean
People who believe in music are the happiest people I've ever seen
So clap your hands and stomp your feet and shake those tambourines
Lift your voices to the sky tell me what you see.

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

Music is the universal language, and love is the key
To peace hope and understanding, and living in harmony
So take your brother by the hand and come along with me
Lift your voices to the sky, tell me what you see

I believe in music
I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in love

WRITER LEW DeWITT

I wanna carry your sweet memories to my grave. At last I've broken off the chain Now just a few shoppin' marts from Maine Now and then a little jolt of sorrow hit my mind But after a while I soon forget the pain. And go on with sweet memories of you And find that I can live my life anew And I erase each thought that I might want you back again And I remember all you put me through. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave. And now I'm free of most the pain And I don't wanna' hurt that way again If I catch me longin' for the way things used to be I just pick up a piece of broken chain. That chain recalls a lot for me I'm reminded how things used to be There's just some things I'd rather not remember about you I just wanna' have sweet memories. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave. I don't wanna' be your servant anymore I don't wanna' be your slave I just wanna' remember all the good times that we shared And carry those sweet memories to my grave...

A little bit tired of it all, she unlocks the doors
And does so much more than what she gets credit for
She opens the mail straightens up without fail

Last Friday evening's mess, she makes brand new coffee
Though her head's hurtin' awfully, by nine she's looking her best
And Monday comes dawning the world wakes up yawning
And Friday seems so far away

But there bright and early Monday morning secretary
You sure do look pretty today, at ten there's a break
She don't always take, just time for a powder and smoke
A salesman comes in, looks her over end to end

And tells her a new dirty joke, she laughs off his pass
Like she's done in the past, she knows all those lines so well
Then at five she goes home to her cat and two rooms
And cries 'cause she's lonely as hell

And Friday seems so far away

There's too many rivers to cross babe too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights I've turned and I've tossed
And there's too many rivers to cross

She gave her heart and soul to me and more I wanted
She left home and gave her life to me alone and I had no right to
Treat her like I treated those before but she loved it and wanted more
Sometimes I lied to make her happy
Sometimes she'd lie to see if I would lie some more

I hear now she's a mother North Carolina with her lover
And I'll bet she daily causes me and she's got reason for it

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

The Statler Brothers,"Perhaps the semi darkness of this room has me confused
You say that you're an old, old friend of mine
And if I'm wrong about you then I beg to be excused
It's just that I have not seen you in quite a long, long time

Or could it be the bottle that you're holding in your hand
The girl I knew could never be that kind
Please be patient with me, I will place you if I can
It's just that I have not seen you in quite a long, long time

The dimple in your cheek is familiar I'll admit
And the smile does resemble one I've known
And the color of your hair does remind me quite a bit
Of someone within the shade of blonde is not just like her own

Now I must go, it's getting late and I do wish you well
And please go kind of easy on the wine
It's possible I know you but it's really hard to tell
It's just that I have not seen you in quite a long, long time

When she combed those last pigtails from her hair
When she wore her sister's dress to the prom I must confess

When she broke her first heart I was there

When she walked down the aisle I was there
When she took the vows to always love and care
With dignity and grace I quietly took my place
With the friends of the bride I was there

When they had their first fight and she called in the night
Though I knew it wasn't right I was there
And when he left her again and she needed a friend

Nothin' but fightin' since creation day
I'll send a little water and I'll wash'em all away

Get a hands have and shave that and build yourself a boat

Noah said Lord I don't believe I could

Ya never know what you can do till you try
Build it 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high

We ain't movin' Lord where are we at
The Lord said you're sittin' on a mountain Ararat

Noah said Lord it's gettin' mighty dry

The Statler Brothers,"Oh Samson it's been said you were a mighty man
I've heard it said you killed a lion with your hands
And when the people of Phillistia raised your ire
Ain't you the man who set their fields on fire

You faced an army of Phillistines all alone
And didn't you tear at their flesh with just a bone
So tell me Samson if these things I hear are true
How could you let a woman get the best of you 

I've heard it said you were the best of many men
That you could tear a city gate right off it's hinge
And that the strongest rope just could not hold you bound
And you completely tore one temple down

How could you let yourself get caught in such disgrace
You got the best of every man you ever faced
And after all the mighty enemies you slew
How could you let a women get the best of you

You've battled many a man till he has turned and fled
Then turned around and let a woman turn your head
You loved the best, my man, but you were bound to fall
By the very thing that you loved best of all

Oh Samson it's been said you were a mighty man
And women were your weakness this I understand
But after all the mighty armies you went through
How could you let a woman get the best of you

Oh Samson it's been said you were a mighty man
And women were your weakness this I understand

Shepherd to his fathers sheep
Played the harp when Saul got weary
Rocked the giant till he was fast asleep

People prayed when Saul killed thousands
When David killed ten thousand they cheered
And all that noise they saw angry
And the shepherd was on the lamb for years

David was a man down in Israel
Fighter, lover, shepherd, king, outlaw
And through it all God loved him and forgave him

Took a bath under David's watchful eye
He fell in love and took her body

Is a man after my own heart

The Statler Brothers,"The Lord appeared to Solomon 
And asked him in his dream
Just what would you want
If I would grant you anything

King Solomon said to the Lord
On riches I won't dwell
Just grant to me the wisdom Lord
To lead Your people well

When he woke the Lord had blessed
The Throne on which he sat
And nobody ever caught him 
Sleepin' after that

People heard about him
And came from far and wide
He'd lay his words of wisdom on
And open up their eyes

And didn't Solomon have it all together
Didn't Solomon lead his people well
Didn't Solomon have all together

Both had given birth
I'm troubled though dear kindly king
Please help me set the birth

One night while I lay sleeping
This womans baby died
She laid it's body on my bosom
Trading it for mine

The other woman said to him 
That it was not true
An' Solomon said bring the child
I'll tell you what we'll do

We'll divide him with a sword
And half to each disperse
The real mother cried oh no
Just give the child to her

And those that bear the cross of right will have reward

Though it's hard to take if it's for My sake
You will have reward by and by

The Statler Brothers,"Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he stopped each day and looked to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey My rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heavens doors and then He guided Moses hand
And said go and tell My children these are My Commands

Go and climb that mountain Moses 
Climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us 
What our Lord has had to say 

Thou shall have no gods before Me is My first Command
And thou shall not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take My name in vain and thou wilt guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the Sabbath day alone for Me
Honor thy father and thy mother and Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not commit adultery and Thou shall not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace 
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his

Go and climb that mountain Moses 
Climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us 
What our Lord has had to say 

Moses showed these words of God to all the children there
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the Promised Land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried as we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do

The Statler Brothers,"What is a miracle? A miracle is an extraordinary event
Showing evidence of a supernatural work of God
While He was on Earth, He performed a lot of miracles
And He performs a lot of miracles today

There's a man in here who turns water to wine
And He walks on the water and gives sight to the blind
And He gives back life to the one's that's dead
And He fed four thousand with seven loaves of bread

Who makes cripples walk and He's chosen even me
For He lives in my heart and I have no fear
I'm a better man, 'cause there's a man in here

""There's a man in here that I'm lookin' for""
Cries a man who could find no room at the door
So they lowered him down on a stretcher bed
And Jesus looked at him and said

""All your sins are all now gone this day
Take up your bed and go your way""
And as he walked through the crowd they heard him declare
I can tell you all there's a man in there

""There's a man in here"" the disciples cried
When the ship was tossed from side to side
So they woke Him up as the waves blew high
And said, ""Don't You care that we're about to die""

And He said, ""Peace be still"" and when the wind had laid
He said, ""Where's your faith, why were you so afraid?""
And when they saw that the sea was smooth and clear
They said, ""Thank you God that the man's in here""

The Statler Brothers,"It started March of sixty-four
Many years ago
We were hired by Johnny Cash
To open up his show

Four boys, a worn out Cadillac
With a road map on the dash
For the next eight and one half years
We got paid by Cash

He took us down to Nashville
To Columbia studio
Not knowing where we came from
They told us where to go

But Johnny said, ""I like 'em
Don't you give them no trash""
You see, we were Johnny's little boys
And we got paid by Cash

We were there when June became
Johnny's lovin' bride
And we sang to him that mornin'
Our buddy Luther died

And we were there when the son was born
That filled them both with pride
And we were there when John remembered
God was on his side

We watched him on the concert stage
We watched him write his songs
And saw the things we had to do
And the things that could go wrong

And if we had to start again
We'd do it in a flash
'Cause we learned more than we earned
When we got paid by Cash

Then came the time when our career
Demanded that we go
And through some tears we all shook hands
That last and final show

All those years we never had
A contract or a clash
Whatever we may be today
We owe it all to Cash

We were there when June became
Johnny's lovin' bride,
And we sang to him that mornin'

That filled them both with pride

Now John will tell you there were years
When times were good and bad
But we can tell you they were some
Of the best we ever had

And the Tennessee Three
We were one big happy family
And would have done it all for free

With nothin' on but the radio
Listenin' to the midnight man takin' telephone requests
Playin' songs that you and I used to know

Do you ever think of me and all the nights
That we wasted and can't get back again
But if we ever do, honey, I promise you
I'll even love you better than I did then

When you go for a walk in the leaves when it's cold
Or lay when it's warm in the sun
With time on your hands and memories on your mind
Or a long sleepless night has just begun

She asked so sweet and tenderly
""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine' 
And would you do it one more time for me"".

The Statler Brothers,"There’s questions we’re always hearing every where we go
Like how do I cut a record or get on a country show
Well, it takes more than just ambition and three chords on an old guitar
There’s a few more things you ought to learn to be a country star

You got to learn to sing like Waylon or pick like Jerry Reed
Yodel like Jeannie Shepard, write songs like Tom T
Put a cry in your voice like Haggard, learn Spanish like Johnny R
Whisper like Bill Anderson and you’ll be a country star

Play piano like Ronnie Mil sap or Gilly or Jerry Lee
Yo-yo like Roy Acuff or talk plain like Ralph Emery
Growl like Conway Twitty, get a red, white and blue guitar
Build a swimming pool like Webb did and you’ll be a country star

Be tall like Sonny James is, tell jokes like Minnie Pearl
Or be short like Jimmy Dickens or play five-string like Earl
Get a hip band like Willie, learn to stutter like M-Mel
Get a cap like Roy Clark wore or a voice like Barbara Mandrel

Be rich like Eddy Arnold, say you’re makin' more than you are
Get a gimmick like Charley Pride got and you’ll be a country star

But if you have no talent and you’re not a male
If you’re built somewhat like Dolly or have a face like Crystal Gayle
Come back stage and ask for Harold, Phil, Don or Lou
And we’ll see you get auditioned for the Statler Brothers Review

About the music and the bridesmaids
Huh, I’ll bet your daddy threw a fit
When he had to get dressed up in that tux and tie

And I noticed where your sister came home from Texas
I know you were glad to see her
And knowin’ your mama, she probably cried
But then so did I

The Statler Brothers,"I didn't come to kiss the bride
So don't seat me on either side
I just came by to see the show
I'm close enough I'll stay right here
I can see and I can hear 
Course I heard it all years ago

I hear the organ play a minor melody
Is that the one they call their song
Church bells always make love sound so easy
But ""as long as you live"" is so long

I didn't come to kiss the bride
Nor come to call the groom outside, No
I can't stay and say hello
That's not the reason I came by
I came today to say goodbye 
To somethin' that happened years ago

I hear the organ play a minor melody
Is that the one they call their song
What God's joined together let no man put asunder
But He sure put us under right or wrong

Give the bride and groom my best
And tell her mom and all the rest
That I was here but I really had to go
Reception line's too long outside

Of the virgin and the manger where He lay
Festive drinks and glasses klinks will not make Jesus

Through many dangers, toils and snares

It is Grace that brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise

It was a late hot summer evening
First time I felt a breeze
She danced by me, pretty as she pleased
There's someone here, a friend said, I'd like for you to meet
And we two stepped the night away in the August eve

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was dancing to the music
While I was falling in love

Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love
She was only dancing
While I was falling in love

A memory of a lifetime
A passing in the dark
Love is so one-sided
So it seems

Today she may be somewhere
In someone else's arms
But tonight I know
She's dancing in my dreams

But you'll shade it to make me look unfair
Then you'll lie outright to all the neighbors and tell you sister that I hate her

If some night in your sleep someone loves you tenderly
And when you wake up in the morning you've dreamed that it was me

That picture you gave me has helped me survive
I've passed by your house a million times outside of town
My mind let my heart stop and take a look around

It's pretty run down and there's ivy everywhere
No scent of your momma's flowers in the air
With no yellow paint the front porch looks plain and sad
That old swing made me smile bout the times that we had

I can't remember if it was your fault or mine
And you can't trust a memory when it's had too much time
I'm haunted by things like your smile and my pride
Like that haunted old house I'm empty inside
[ steel ]
Although it was quiet I swear I could hear
The record I bought you by the Platters that year
I walked up the front steps but stopped at the door
There's nothing for me in there anymore

I wiped a tear from your cheek the last time I saw you
And I've held it in my hand because well I just wanted to
But I lost it today in that lonesome old place
That tear I was saving wound up on my face

I can't remember if it was your fault or mine...

Writin' songs on napkins to keep from gettin' bored
Starving for some work and a little bite to eat
Countin' last night's money and wonderin' where we'd sleep

Wonderin' what she's doin' since the last time that I called
Cause she's alone in Virginia and I'm in Arkansas
Lord knows I love my music and she knows I love her too
She's a better man than I am to let me do the things I do

We like to pick and sing and it's not a nine to five
It may not be a real job but it keeps our dream alive
We've sung for more than many and sometimes quite a few
Either way it doesn't matter it's what we love to do

Each night is somethin' different cause we're learning more each day
We know now how the cards are dealt and we know now how to play
After weeks the days seem longer but at home not long at all
The sun shines warm at our house but out here it feels like fall

Backstage we say a small prayer then do what we do best
The band begins our music and we'll do all the rest
The ride home will be the long one as soon as the show is through
I know she'll be up waiting it's what we love to do

In your back yard the evening of graduation?

You wrote on the back, you wrote
Well you know what you wrote
Or maybe you don't but I do

I still go to the same theater we went to that summer
I always sit about tenth from the back on the right
You always got a headache if we sat any closer
And had to squint if we sat any farther back

You were a lot of trouble to me
Of course I see the same people
We saw that summer
None of them ever mention you

I guess they don't know
I still remember you like I do
Or maybe they do know
I still remember you like I do
Maybe that's why they don't mention you

And the places, the places are still there
Although most of them have changed
That narrow bumpy dirt road up to the knoll
Where we used to park has been paved
And a new housing development has gone in

Houses, cars, and people have invaded our place
Where your innocence became my guilt
People live daily as if nothing has ever happened
On that piece of ground

I've learned other songs on the piano
The fair doesn't come anymore
Until late September
And those songs make me
Sad now instead of happy

The pictures have gotten bent
And corners broken off
They've put on a new wide screen
And swinging chairs in the theater

The people have grown older
And the knoll is a pool of lights after dark
But the summers are still hot and that's the
'Bout the only thing that hasn't changed
Except that I still love you",That Summer

The Statler Brothers,"I sold the farm to take my woman
Where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee

I bought the one way tickets
She had often begged me for
That took us to
The streets of Baltimore

Her heart was filled with laughter
When she saw those city lights
She said, ""She prettiest place
On earth is Baltimore at night""

A man feels proud to give
His woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked

I ran an old machine
We bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene

But every night when I came home
With every muscle sore
She'd drag me through

They've been livin' it up
And layin' up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to kinda come around
But they still feel bad and they're down

And mad ‘cause they've got four more day
Before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feelin' fine again
And they're workin' like a dog and diggin' in

Tryin' to do everything they should
Puttin' 'em cars together good
And I got me a car that was made
On Wednesday, on Wednesday

If you're gonna buy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough
To get one made on Wednesday

On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week
That's the day they make lemons dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday
Friend, you'll soon be in the creek

’Cause it's payday and the loafin' has begun
Lord them Friday cars just hope you don't get one
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday

And my car was made
On Wednesday, on Wednesday

Tryin' hard to figure out my life and what it means
It's not the things I never got the chance to do that matter
It's the things I took the chance to do that matter most to me
I've had a good time had a good life had a good home had a good wife
Had a little rain had a little sun had a little sin I had a little fun
I've been up on cloud nine been down on my luck
Make a few friends made a few bucks
Been fell in love a couple of times I've had a good time
I've had a good time had a good ride sometimes I lost sometimes I won
Wrote a few songs that still get sung I didn't give up and I didn't die young
I've been up I've been down I've been to the wall
But I've been blessed Lord through it all
Even fell in love two or three more times I've had a good time

I've had a good time had a good ride sometimes I laughed sometimes I cried
Sometimes I looked sometimes I touched sometimes I took just a little too much

Standing here on the street like strangers when we meet
Oh God knows it's been too long ago

I won't try to lie to you cause time just won't let us
Play the games we once had the time to play
We're both a little older but Lord you don't look it
When you smile I feel eighteen again today
But it's been too long ago...

There are so many things I'd love to ask you
Where you live whatcha doin' your last name
And do you remember the things I remember
Cause a memory minus one is a shame

The Statler Brothers,"I knew she was the one the second I feel in love
Like a pocket on a shirt she fit me like a glove
There's nothing I wanted more than for her to be my wife
But it scared me to think of taking on another life
It was the longest night before our wedding day
I wasn't having second thoughts I just had more prayers to say
I sat there in the church alone asked my father man to man
Can I live up to the promise when I don't know if I can
Well I remember the first bike that I tried to ride
I couldn't ride it no matter how hard I tried
Then my dad told me the secret that I never will forget
He said it's not that you can't do it you just haven't I done it yet

After five good years of marriage my promise is still good
Now she wants to be a mother and I'm faced with fatherhood
So I prayed to my father I need some help once again
Do you think I'll do alright dad I don't know if I can
Well I remember the first bike...

The very next evening, they'll court another,
Leave you alone to pine and sigh""

He's got a chain five miles long,
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

And hope that she will be your wife,

Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard, an old time melody,

I loved to hear the music, I was only five,

I listened as his fingers made the banjo come alive.


Sometimes I?d wake up at night, and hear a distant tune,

The banjo would echo, ?round my childhood room,

I?d sneak down the back stairs, Daddy never knew.

I?d grab a broom and make believe, I was pickin?, too.

--Chorus--

One day Daddy put my fingers down upon his fist,

He picked it with his other hand, we made the banjo ring;


Now the music takes me back, cross the yellow day, 

Soon the summer?s with my Dad, and the tunes he made.

--Break--

But I?m just tellin? lyes ?bout the things I did,

See I?m that banjo player who never had a kid,

Now, I sit, beneath that yellow tree,

Hopin? that a kid somewhere, is listening to me.


Daddy played the banjo, ?neath the yellow tree,

It rang across the backyard and wove a spell on me,

Now the banjo takes me back, through the foggy haze,

With memories of what never was, become the good old days.

I give a fuck who's who
I chef the same when I'm preparing it
From bad kid to semi-rich middle-aged American
Rooted in my heritage, wounded for the derelicts
The root of every evil is the truth of all appearances
I crack the sound but the beat is still a barrier
And every fucking inch of every street around this area
The Venice carry us up like dough rises
Rap transit all city, no license
The city is beneath, I watch it from a bird's eye
Brain dead, two left, they shot me in my third eye
Shot out my eye like ? on a Christmas day
Reach for pistols as I watch the fuckin' Pistons play
I set the tone with the writings on the wall
The city cleans it up like we inviting 'em all
Evolution's all messed up now, chop the middleman
Stab the messenger, not the literal
I ran without a cause and was the best before I knew shit
Before I took a cruise ship, before I been to Houston
I ain't tying up loose ends I let 'em waiver
Pulling out these lavers and pounding out the pavement
Gone

I'm the lyrical gangsta

I be a young motherfucker of the rap camp
Style symbolizes my nastiness like a tramp stamp
Wamp wamp, where it's at
Fear fact, just let them legends die and I'll inherit that
I'm fit for the carry, weight of the world I carry on my back
With a fairer sack, inquisitions to the mirror
Exactly what niggas fearing, see the future in it's clearest
It is I, Doms, dropping lyrical pipe bombs
Until an icon, I choke your life like a python
I'm who the children look up, probably got 'em doing kush ups
Super high, call me Superfly, bitch I'm Jimmy Snuka
Got you feeling like you took a hit of heroin
And that's for veterans, the way I bury 'em, embarrassing
You know better than puttin' that fire near the kerosine
I said don't make me tell again like kids with speech impediments
They can't see where my head is, I'm ahead
Roll the credits, roll the medics
Getting high till I feel I'm copacetic

I'm the lyrical gangsta

Yo I've been trying to keep it silent, my tendency to violence
The suit and tie be fading, the truth about the shining
The sliding through the masses, smiling eyes through glasses
My style been altercated all the while to pile my cash in
But fuck that though, I want a ho that stay up late
My dirty bottom bitch to fuck with me until the wake
Mad illegal C.R.E.A.M, ain't no rules, that's the dream
In regal swimming pools prepping tools for future schemes
Laying low and creeping it, selling dope and sleeping it
Wrap the dough up in a rope, keep in what I'm sleeping in
Mattress fettucini, life's a flick and I'm Fellini
Pinky diamond rings above the rims of ice martinis
Trees throughout the day, hour focused in a haze
We living life the most, been comatosed all the way
The toast to hell that may, cause making bread legit's too real
So I'm folding on the stress of life to steal to catch a meal

Step on the gas and turbo jet pasture
And it's only begun like Jimmy Castor
Dumbin' out, coming out the ghetto blaster
We came here to blow your mind
Step Masters!

Beats like this
Make me bang my head and beat my fist
On the table, ropes thicker than them ski lift cables
Talk slick, I'll connect both of your lips with staples
Like a mummy rap, but this is straight dummy rap
Not Easter Bunny rap, don't sleep on the paper
Or take money naps, I race on the track like Ricky Bobby
Spit it sloppy, my profession's videography
I'm high definition, 1080p description
Flipping like things that flip
Don't read off a script, heavyweight, I make the needle skip
Crush 'em like a fuckin' Dorito chip, then move on to the next
Lava burns heavy on the decks
Middle finger stretch, triple X, words that I stretch
Make it impossible for me to catch a breath
Move faster, telecaster, coming out the ghetto blaster

Step master, step faster
Step on the gas and turbo jet pasture
And it's only begun like Jimmy Castor
Dumbin' out, coming out the ghetto blaster

The Step Brothers,"Yo, could it be I stayed away too long?
Lighting up to Cypress Hill I was the side of the bong
Catching arthritis my pen was the heaviest
Bars trapped in a cell, run on sentences
Cleanse my readiness, my pencil is deep
I might erase every beat until it sends me to sleep
Send for the heat without relational guns
Send for weed drinking Jamaican rum
I only run between the moon and New York city 
With a crew that get busy like Bizzie be winning
And in the night still pitching like I’m in the first inning
Curve spinning these curtains are swervining
Disturbing images I cover the scent another visual
I mask and still never repent
Event the tide from the pull of the moon
From where I currently reside where its currently June
And kind of worry how my currency views
Kind of murder don’t mind if I do

My grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire
My grandma told your grandma, ""I'm gonna set your will on fire""
Talking 'bout hey now

Cake is duffel the biscuits buttered
Placed in covered the steak is smothered
Monetary notes growing ropes homes on boats
That’s why every step I take is brothered
Step I fly off the handle to create my supper
As an OG told me a closed mouth doesn’t get fed
Push the level over the red
Pushes under my blankets they know to spread
Like butter and jelly over the bread
I’m on my alchensteam Toot-Toot!
Runaway train blowing his steam from out them things
That resemble a stove top kettle. Hot metal on schedule
I bust but your but macla rasto seco
Like the chamber make my vocals that go that go that go

From the moment that the ladies screamed me at the cheering
From the tone of the rain seemed so appealing
Did not invent the money printed but I’m getting it
Did not invent the wheel but motherfuckas spinning it
I’m not the paranoid searching for my calling yo
Straight out the barrio one baritone of audio
I carry on listen I carry on tradition
I took a toothbrush to old kids and pairs of blissen
So fuck this place and a staircase to sit in
In a city where you need a flashy car just to fit in
I never tried to make it I was only trying living
Claimed in on math but mothafuckas never give it…
Up sick of giving I got nothing to show
But ain't sick of being sick with it it’s the sickest you know

I don’t communicate with conversation
I stay up late nights in the basement
Charge extra for installation
Chop up loop like little bits of bacon
While I operate on a patient
Laboratory coats is what I’m draped in
More than the money notes my music is my motivation
Uh burn nicotine blow out Listerine
Lincoln to Michigan live from the coffee bean
And TV’s depiction is off bring in the green leaf
Too many Indians that want to be chief
I’m confident with my spot nobody can ounce me
As a youth my parents figured out they couldn't house me
Some even made me try to play the sideline and couch me
Now they stand at attention every time they announce me
Success is my revenge
You throwing pebbles in the wind
I send messengers with a pen
More medicine with the blend

Caps are what I never type
Bought when I’m stepping out
Stack till I get it right
Red state blue state politics bang
The day is new same shit different game
Been running ink to tunnel vision
Maybe it’s the night
So I’m waiting till the sun is risen
Some forgive some forget the summer debt
The summer time some will regret
Some of the bets win more then its less
I keep pressing till the vinyl breaks
Vital mistakes are at a viral rate
The eyes had it till they expand or dilate
I’m on the fire escape off the highest of flames
Debating science hearing sirens and things
I start my movement view to the stars
And start grooving pointing tools at mars
Licking shots from my union
I catch the plot when I clue in
I caught a permanent and never been removed since…
Bitch, bitch

The Stereo,"You know what I'm saying
It happened long ago
For reasons I don't want to know
The only thing I learned
I know you won't return
And I'm doomed to a life I don't wanna know
But I keep moving on
And hope I'm hanging on
Now I'm stuck here singing no I don't belong
But we were wrong
We were wrong to get involved
Now it's all our fault
It's turned into something we don't need
But I didn't know
What shame it was and it's all my fault
I know I said somethings that I don't mean
Let go
Tell me why cause I don't know
The reasons that you had to go
The reasons that you said goodbye
Come back
I may be down but I'm still intact
And holding on I can't look back
Does it make you wonder why
How could I be so blind?
I spent last summer waiting
Waiting for a chance
Last in line but I got no patience
The only thing I learned
I know you won't return
And I'm still stuck here singing no I won't be heard
Everyone is staring at me now
But it's not the same
I didn't know
It doesn't mean you have to go far away
I didn't know
It doesn't mean we have to throw it away
I didn't know
I can't believe it but I see it
And I can't change your mind
Cause I can't change your mind

The Stereo,"Everyone's so into you
But that's not what you're into
You're so confused you've lost your mind
You feel washed up you feel so left behind

Everyone's so into you
But that's not what you're into
Can anybody comprehend the risks involved

And the chance you take to pretend?
Does anybody truly see?
Does everybody know but me?

No longer will I sleep alone
Wasting my life by the phone
No longer will I cry another tear for you
Everyone's so into you

But that's not what you're into
You need not have to carry on
You can't let go or run home anymore
Everyone's so into you

It's hard to part but you make it so easy

I'm through missing you",So into You
The Stereo,"I'll wear my army coat
Cause that's all that I own
I won't forget about
The time spent so alone
You wear your navy shirt
And plaid skirt, no cell phone
Those were our better days
I'd die to be there today
In 1994 it seems so far away from 1998
We use to say that we would never let go
We use to say things were OK but now I don't know
I'm afraid to wake up so I won't
If you know any other way, I don't
Where were you before 1994?
Why did you walk away in 1998?
I can't take anymore cause 1994
It seems so far away from 1998
The songs we use to sing
The walks that we would talk
Forget about those days
A childish, nostalgic walk

The Stereo,"Your heart stopped beating on it's own
Forget that girl
Your lungs stopped breathing on their own
Forget that girl
Your eyes can't see behind your truth
Forget that girl
And your mind can't think, so what's the use
Forget that girl
It's a lame excuse for being rude
An all out snotty attitude
No rhyme, no reason, no remorse
Forget that girl
No matter which you think is worse
Forget that girl
This might hurt now, but give it time
Forget that girl
Take that first step and you'll be fine
Forget that girl
If you end up safe home tonight
You might have finally got it right
Sound off, take a stand
Sound off, baby, while you can
Sound off, safe at home
Sound off, maybe, I don't know
Sound off, no one knew
Sound off, baby, where are you?
You don't really mean it, do you know?
Forget that girl
And you might believe it, but can you show?
Forget that girl
It's the easy way of giving up
A real fast way to lose, then what?
Your heart stopped beating on it's own
Forget that girl
Your lungs stopped breathing on their own
Forget that girl



",Stop Breathing
The Stereo,"This is my last chance
Is this really what we want?
Now that you have gone away
You are far away from me
Thanks a lot
I've waited so long
Wanna get things straight
But now it's all too little
Too late
I won't sit, I can't resist
I don't mean to drag this out
One last kiss, one left to miss
I have failed to drown you out

The Stereo,"You want it, you need it
But always give up so easy
So what now? so be it
You always give up so easy
Alright, alright
Hangin on, holding out
A bitter end to all our doubts
Genius invention
Of clever misdirection
If it's the same every time
Then why can't I
Make my brain decide
I want to believe you
Anytime, anywhere
27, only halfway there
It's a miracle I've made it this far
But now my tires are running out of air
Take me to the wall
I'm breaking up
You're making my mistake
You better believe it
Cause this time is different I mean it
Game over, defeated
The end is all but completed
Alright, alright

The Stone Coyotes,"The last thing I remember
Before they brought me in
Was whispering through trembling lips
""Take a message to my kin""

After that the only
Recollection I have
Is tracing with my fingertips
A faded photograph

I was out on the Black Atlantic
Clinging to the mast
(Sails tattered on the mast)
Praying on the windswept deck
That this ship is built to last
Calling, Crying, Shouting out your name

They say that once you've been there
You are never quite the same
My nerves are shot to pieces
I've been waiting here in vain

A ghost got in the looking glass
Who is that I see?
A shock of recognition
That poor lost soul is me

Since that night out on the sea
No keepsakes do I have
Just the thought, the dream of you
And a salt-stained photograph

Now I walk these paper streets
And all the buildings sway
The tides that shift beneath my feet
Are going to carry me away",The Black Atlantic
The Stone Coyotes,"Bone tired, world-weary
Someday I'll lay my burden down
Then I'll walk where angels talk
And stand on sacred ground
All my life

Got my eyes on Eternity

I met a man, he was walking
Down this long and lonesome road
He said, ""I have a heavy pack upon my back
And no way to lighten the load

I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
I work all day and half the night
Get up and do it all again""

I saw a woman with her head bowed down
She had fallen to her knees
All alone in a church of stone
Begging, ""Lord, please

Have mercy, give me
The strength to carry on
'Cause sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Like I'm already dead and gone""",Bone Tired
The Stone Coyotes,"Through a field there ran a brook
From the hills beyond
Where a boy put down his book
And from me now is gone

I am reminded of him here
Where rain on heather falls
The pages scattered on the banks
Since first he heard the call

""Arise, arise, and come away
You are our pride and joy
The drums shall roll and the pipes shall play
For our highland boy""

He sailed on ships and loved a wife
Children played upon his knee
He read the story of his life
That told his destiny

And when in Death's cold eyes he looked
He bravely faced the foe
And through his heart there ran the brook
He followed long ago


And so we laid him to his rest
We laid him gently down
We heard Scotland's bonnie drums
And there was glory in the ground

The field shall be his blanket warm
The stars his diadem
The hills shall stand his honor guard
And the pipes his requiem",Highland Boy

The Stone Coyotes,"As I walked out in lower Manhattan
A girl I chanced to pass by
Something about her caught my attention
Something hard to identify

She carried a suitcase through the streets of the city
And shivered with cold in the thin coat she wore
She said, ""Look at my face - it used to be pretty
Now I'm old and I'm twenty-four.""

If you see the one who put the tears in my eyes
He's got a gold-tipped cane and a rose tattoo
Tell him I love him - Tell him goodbye
I would stay, but I'd be crazy to

At first it was romance just like in a movie
Romeo and Juliet when we began
But then it got dark and then it got ugly
He showed me affection with the back of his hand

He liked to mix his powders and potions
Bought in the alleys away from the light
He'd say, ""I'll fix you up - name your poison""
I watched him age ten years overnight

Blowing smoke rings that gave him a halo
He'd talk about his criminal mind
He'd say, ""Well, I guess it's just your fate to go
Falling in love with the dangerous kind.""",If You See the One
The Stone Coyotes,"Somebody must have said something

Waiting for the sky to fall

Do you hear the words we say?
Something might be comin' around the corner
This could be your lucky day

Saying how you can't go on

And while I'm not prone to displays of emotion
I find it hard to say goodbye to you

I ride along the great divide
Far from the world I have known
But my heart still sings and my horse has wings
To fly and carry me home

And I'd like to rise above it 
But I fear I've fallen prey
To the forces that I railed against 
In my angry young man days

At least that's how it feels tonight

In her gaudy dress and her bracelets of gold
Dangling from her withered arms

There were girls with dangling earrings on

The Stone Roses,"I've seen your severed head at a banquet for the dead
All dressed up for dinner, looked so fine
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered
With the finest military quick lime

Now try and picture this, as I gave you a kiss
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade
We laughed as we put away your wine

So raise your glasses, here's a toast to wasted lives
May all their ghost come back to haunt you
And tell you how they died

How do you sleep 
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay
How do you feel 
When you close your eyes and try and drift away
Does it feel any better now, does it mean any more
When the angel of death comes knock, knocking
And banging at your door

When all the fun was over, I put you on my shoulder
Took you home, away from it all
Shot down and claimed, mounted and framed
Tastefully hung up on my wall

Are my dreams your nightmares  
Get off your knees, the party's over
I'm coming home to you

How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay
How do you feel

The Stone Roses,"You should've been an angel, it would've suited you
My gold-leaf tryptic angel, she knows just what to do
In the half-light of morning, in a world between the sheets
I swear I saw her angel wing, my vision was complete

And I know I'll never want another lover, my sweet
Can there be more in this world than the joy of just watching ya sleep?
I don't know just what to feel
Won't someone tell me my love's real?

Are we etched in stone or just scratched in the sand
Waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land?
Will the sunshine all sweetness and light
Burn us to a cinder, our third stone satellite?

The Stone Roses,"Burst into heaven
Kiss in the cotton clouds
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat
I can't stop coming down
Your shrunken head
Looking down on me above
Send me home like an elephant stone
To smash my dream of love
Dreaming 'till the sun goes down
And night turns into day
Rooms are empty I've got plenty
You could move in right away
Seems like there's a hole in my dreams
In my dreams in my dreams
Down through the heavens
Choke in the cotton clouds
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat
I can't stop coming down
Your shrunken head
Looking down on me above
Send me home like an elephant stone
To smash my dream of love
Did your bed and bookshelf go
And run run run away
These four walls saw the rise and fall
And your midnight getaway
Seems like there's a hole in my dreams
Or so it seems
Yet nothing means anything anymore",Elephant Stone [Remastered]
The Stone Roses,"Down down, you bring me down
I hear you knocking at my door and I can't sleep at night
Your face, it has no place
No room for you inside my house I need to be alone

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

Turn turn, I wish you'd learn
There's a time and place for everything I've got to get it through
Cut loose, you're no use
I couldn't stand another second in your company

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

Stone me, why can't you see
You're a no-one nowhere washed up baby who'd look better dead

Your tongue is far too long
I don't like the way it sucks and slurps upon my every word

Don't waste your words I don't need anything from you
I don't care where you've been or what you plan to do

I am the resurrection and I am the light
I couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as I'd like

I am the resurrection and I am the light
I couldn't ever bring myself to hate you as I'd like",I Am the Resurrection [Remastered]
The Stone Roses,"I can feel the earth begin to move
I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
The past was yours
But the future's mine
You're all out of time

I don't feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion fruit and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her here she comes

She bangs the drums
Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel

How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

Have you seen her have you heard

The Stone Roses,"Chimes sing Sunday morn
Today's the day She's sworn
To steal what She never could own
And race from this hole She calls home

Now you're at the wheel
Tell me how how does it feel
So good to have equalized
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the West

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips Her and wails
And fills up Her rickety sails

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall",Waterfall [Remastered]
The Stone Roses,"Here comes the wise man
And there goes the fool
You see that burnt out world that he is living in
I don't need to look for the rules
Here comes the donkey
Chained to a ten ton plough
He'll never make that hill in a million years
Whip crack beating down

He loves his brother but he'd sell him for a fistful of gold
He needs a slave for his vision of the promised land
No i don't believe a word
Take me any way the wind blows
You'll never know just what you want to do
Or where you want to go i think it's time
That you found what the world is waiting for
I think it's time to get real

Here comes the wise man
And there goes the fool
You see that burnt out world that he is living in
I don't need to look for the rules

Here comes the donkey
Chained to a ten ton plough
He'll never make that hill in a million years
Whip crack beating down

Anytime you want it then it's there
All you gotta do is stop it
On the corner and ask
Say hey you don't live today
Stop the world
Stop the world

I'm getting off
Can't get enough
I'm getting off",What the World is Waiting For [Remastered]
The Stone Roses,"River splashes against the rocks,
And I scale the slope,
I hope the tracks won't,
Lead me down to dark black pits, 
Or places where we fall to bits,
If she were there i'd hold her down,
I'd push her under while she drowns 
And couldn't breathe and claw for air-
She doesn't care for my despair,

Or is it me?
The one that's wrong?
You see it in the sea,
River cools where I belong,
In my Mersey paradise

As I stare an oil wheel comes sailing by,
And I feel like,
Growing fins and falling in,
With the bricks the bikes, the rusty tin
I swim around without a care,
I'm eating sand when I need air,
You can bet your life I'll meet a pike who'll wolf me down for tea tonight

I want to be, I want to be,
Where the drownings are,
(drownings are),
You see it in the sea,
River cools where I belong,
In my Mersey paradise

I want to be, I want to be,
Where the drownings are,
(drownings are),
You see it in the sea,
River cools where I belong,
Oh yeah
I want to be, I want to be,
Where the drownings are,

River cools where I belong,

The Stonemans,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee
The Stonemans,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

You've made me throw my old friend down

For honor and fortune have men left their wives 
Lust for destruction has confused their minds 
Changed into monsters they don't want to be 

The struggle is even and no one can tell 
A figure of saying for whom the bell tolls 
No one has come here to let themselves die 
A side of the winners is the ultimate goal

I'm losing sleep, I can't let you slip away, don't slip away
Now we can't keep this silence up, I've had enough
We need to find another way, or the words to say

Girl, I think I know but I've been wrong before
I need you now, I couldn't want you more
You're gonna feel what I already know, we need each other so don't let go, no

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone, you're gonna feel the way I do
You can try to hide it, but you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss my loving touch that you know you need so much
Yeah you're gonna miss me, just like I miss you

Oh it's true
If there's a problem, a shadow of doubt, we'll work it out
Your heart's gonna let you know, which way to go
So don't let a good thing die tonight

We've got the chance and we can make it right
Your eyes can tell me just what we should do
It's never too late girl for me and you

The Story,"My mother moved the furniture when
she no longer moved the man
We thought nothing of it at the time
She painted walls, painted smiles,
Checked herself in the mirror one more time,
Then yoked her heart to a whim
But the history of desire is such that just one word -
just one touch could send it reeling
She passed go again and again
never collected her two hundred
Or landed on the purple with the Jones'
She wanted to be a different person
She sat down, finally, and he walked away
He walked away
She listened to the angel - she said to flatter
She said to coo - she said it won't matter
I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill
the angel in the house
Even in my wildest heart, I cannot kill
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
You hang on to the pieces of the game that don't talk back
Don't sneak around
Movable objects, but, where were we?
Don't let anything happen
We're back to the wheel, back to fire, onto the high wire
'Cause she listened to the angel - she said to flatter
She said to coo - she said it won't matter
I thought I was by myself, but I cannot kill
the angel in the house
Even in my wildest heart,
I cannot kill the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house
the angel in the house

The Story,"Sometimes I'm happy, mostly I'm not,
I like to be alone a lot
And I don't know how I got this way,
Everything around me seems so crazy
My life is a rented hotel for the poor
The rooms are bare, and I'm afraid to close the door
But I keep the light on in the hall
And the perfume of the lover on my hands
And in a twinkling we will all be changed
And I'll wait for you, and I'll wait for you
In a twinkling we will all be changed

The Story,"Even when I was a little girl -- even then
No one could tell me why, no one convinced me,
Through the cathedral,
The high windows spilling crimson light
Cross the deceived ones, no evidence of grace in their eyes
But when I saw the father, shaken, spent like spare change,
On his knees and under the gun
Then I wondered what would become of me
You might have told me that love is not enough
You might have lied and told me that it was,
The gilded cage and the holy three
Don't tell the truth as far as I can see
And in the end you choose someone, something, and
Others fade from view
And the world outside your lives exhausts you
Therein lies the ritual, you harbor no curiosity for the
High windows, the crimson light, or the deceived ones -
Dying randomly
But when I saw the father, shaken, spent like spare change,
On his knees and under the gun
Then I wondered what would become of me

The Story,"I’d settle for less but I’d hold you accountable
Knock on your door but I wouldn’t take no for a ride
A month in the country, a day by your side
Two years in the forest, I can’t see the trees if you hide

And if you forgot, could I make you remember
The piece of yourself that you gave long ago?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze
There at the still point, that’s where I’ll be

We would find hindsight at the edge of the world
Love at the end of indifference
We’d be the lovers that time could forget
Distance would forge us, make us stronger in the end

And if I forgot, could you make me remember
The piece of myself that I left winding by?
It’s on the top current of love’s final breeze
There at the still point, that’s where I’ll be

At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire

We’d be forever, a month in the country
A day by your side, two years in the forest
A decade of hopeful, a terrible leap
When it all comes out in the wash
I will love you, I will love you

At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, at the still point, at the still point of desire
At the still point, the still point, at the still point of desire

It took a long time to gain this weight,
It will take a long time to lose it again
I will have only water for a week, then maybe carrots,
and celery, and if I lose then Sunday I'll have brown rice
Because someone will adore me when my ribs show clearly
and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs
when I'm only one hundred pounds
I bought a doctor's scale on sale today
It takes up half the bathroom, and it's really ugly,
but I know it's going to help me reach my goal
I get so dizzy when I stand up fast, and I don't feel like
dancing but I know I'm gonna do it this time, for sure
Now I walk past the fatsos eating doughnuts,
with cream filling, icing, jimmies, and I am so glad I am not

and I'm thin even when I sit down
Someone will admire my gorgeous arms and legs

All over the parquet flooring 
Being a school mam 
Letting the flood gates open wide

Being a school mam 
One and one make two if you're very lucky 
Being a school mam 
Two twos make four if I remember correctly 
Being a school mam 
Four fours make sixteen and sixteen's over age 
Sixteen and sixteen makes thirty two 
That's approaching middle age 
Thirty two and thirty two makes sixty four 
That's OAP land 
Sixty four and sixty four makes a hundred and twenty eight 
A hundred and twenty eight divided by three 
Let me pause for reflection for a second
But teacher! 
Three doesn't go into a hundred and twenty eight exactly, 
But it goes forty two and a bit 
Forty three, forty four, forty five, forty six, forty seven
Forty eight, forty nine,

Why don't you let up sometime
Hawks out here with his axe and me with this lead sheet on
Trying to scuffle up those two's and fews
For uncle so I can bail out my full orchestration

Looks like he got me but this cat wouldn't feed
Grass to a horse in a concrete pasture
He's so tight he wouldn't buy a pair of shorts for a flea
Just look at him n' dig that vine

And the world was wonderful
A midnight summer dream had me in its spell

I dreamt about an old man
Sat and watched the rain all night
He couldn't sleep a wink as all the drops fell

He told me of the beauty
Hidden in our foreheads
He told me of the ugliness
We show instead

And when we put a foot wrong do we learn
From all the pain
A midnight summer dream as he watched the rain

Then at midnight he poured another drink
And bent my ear
After midnight we sat up half the night
Or maybe more
And he began to tell me what it was all for

I woke up in an armchair
He had gone I don't know where
Left me there to sit and look at the rain

Don't remember much at all
But his words were echoing
A midnight summer dream and then wake again

Maybe I'll never find him
Maybe he's gone forever
Maybe I'll have to sit here
Watching the weather

One thing's pretty certain helped me
Make it in the night
Showed me somewhere else between wrong and right

And at midnight if you can't sleep
Then I can bend your ear
After midnight we'll sit up half the night
Or maybe more
And I'll begin to tell you what it is all for

Wake up on a good day
And the world feels wonderful
Midnight summer dream has me in its spell.

And he stuttered sometimes
And he needed a girl friend night times
Didn't know how to go about it

And he was my friend
At school we were always close together

He used to go out for walks on his own
With no-one to talk to at all
He'd walk in the park till the evening grew dark
Just feeling quite incredibly small

He was sitting in the park one Sunday evening
Around about five
When along came a lady, a total stranger
Wanted young Jimmy to go with her
Poor Jimmy Wilson, poor Jimmy Wilson

Well she was so persuasive and seemed quite friendly
So he went along
And the lady who was lonely gave him tea
And she was his friend for ever after

Perhaps the strangest of all nature's rebels

And the smiles shone like pearls on the sea

It caught my eye with a quizzical stare
Was it my love, was it she who was there?

At the water's edge
And from my windy crag
Above the moorland sedge

I see the willow fronds
Caress the ripples
I feel her nipples
At my fingertips

Her breasts are gentle snowdrifts
In an open field
The supple fingered winter wind
The grass concealed

And though the winter wind
May be deceiving
I feel her breathing
At my fingertips

Her legs the spreading branches
Of the tree of life
The willow wand will bend
Before the woodman's knife

The tangle thicket parts
Before the forest fire
Her warm desire
Is at my fingertips

The Strawbs,"The boatman rose to the sound of his heartbeat
Loud in the silent approach of the dawn
He glanced through the window at mist on the lake
Which hung like a shroud in the still of the morn
The silver cobwebs spun with the dew
Hung from the bushes in filigree splendor
And water lilies asleep on the lake
Were reflected so delicate, tranquil and tender.

The boat man sighed as he strode through the woods
To the place where his boat lay moored to a stake
The hollow sound as his footsteps echoed
Until the sound was lost on the lake
He cast off, poling the boat from the shore
Peering a head through damp clinging haze
He thought that he saw strange swirling shapes
A trick on the eyes that the mist often plays.

So intent was the boatman on crossing the lake
That he failed to notice the current that flowed
Leading his boat from familiar parts
He was firmly, yet somehow unknowingly, towed
All at once the mist seemed to lift
Sufficient to show the boatman a pool
That he'd never seen in the whole of his life
Unnaturally deep, black and silent, and cool.

The boatman's shirt clung to his back
He was sweating both from exertion and fear
He had the sensation that someone was watching
He felt the presence of somebody near
An invisible force prevented him moving
The strength of his arms was utterly sapped
The twisted bushes converged round the lake
Like a fish in a net he was trapped.

Suddenly out of the water before him
The wraith-like form of a maiden appeared
Clad in shimmering radiant robes
The maiden materialized as she neared
The hair which finely crowned her head
Was a halo of golden reflecting the sun
All of the beautiful women of time
Were formed all at once into one.

She handed the boatman the sword she was holding
Which flashed iridescent before his eyes
Excalibur surely was hardly a match
For a sword that simple description defies
The boatman stood transfixed by her gaze
Which reached to the depths of his very soul
To he who could conquer the evils of life
She offered herself as a whole.

The maiden vanished before his gaze
Leaving him clutching the sword in his fist
The hairs on the nape of his neck seemed to stiffen
A creature approached him from out of the mist
It was powerful, huge and yet stupid indeed
For it held right back and failed to attack
The boatman struck at its small stupid eyes
And it crashed to the ground and lay on its back.

Without a warning the sky seemed to blacken
As though the sun were in total eclipse
The boatman crouched low as a vast eagle swooped
And a horrified cry escaped from his lips
It strutted before him with pride in its bearing
Admiring its talons both vicious and cruel
Taking advantage the boatman struck fast
And the eagle slid to the depths of the pool.

The terrified boatman tried moving his boat
But his pole had grown roots in the watery deep
The bank grew alive with the coils of a snake
And all you could hear was its slither and creep
It cast an envious stare at the boatman
Slid into the water and swam to the boat
He stood hypnotized by its green jealous eyes
As it came from the water and coiled round his throat.

As its coils tightened slowly his breath came in gasps
As he choked so he lifted the sword in despair
As the snake was still gloating he severed its head
And in death the snake's coils thrashed wild in the air
The boatman wiped the sweat from his brow
His heart was pounding as never before
His eyes like a lizard's tongue darted around
Not daring to rest for a minute or more.

An involuntary shiver went up his spine
As he heard the sound of eerie howls
A wolf appeared on the banks of the pool
Saliva dripped from its loathsome jowls
Hatred smoldered deep in his eyes
Which glowed like coals from Hades fire
It seemed to grow as it crouched and snarled
And watched as the boatman began to tire.

It was almost as though the wolf had learned
For it did not attack as the others had done
But bended its time until the moment was right
And sprang as the boatman stared into the sun
But the boatman too had learned to hold back
And holding his sword as though a knife
He plunged it deep into the wolf's heart
Then fell to his knees and prayed for his life.

As he felt a hand on his shoulder he whirled
To find the maiden by his side
She smiled and the world seemed to open before him
He tried to speak but his tongue was tied
You must plunge the sword deep into my heart
Lest I should crumble into dust
She offered the boatman the meaning of life
And love, if he could but conquer lust.

She bared her breasts before his eyes
The boatman still was stricken dumb
He flung the sword back into the water
Back to the depths from which it had come
The water around him began to boil
The maiden began to wither away
His boat was swamped as the creatures arose
And evil lived for another day.",The Vision of the Lady of the Lake

The Strawbs,"The bird had silver wings, my friends,
And reached out for the sky;
It found its wings were broken,
It had lost the right to fly.
The pink-eyed salamander
Changed its colours for the day;
It changed from white to purest gold
And left the stag at bay.
Now I am but a p;oor man
In the apple blossom state,
I choose to fly where'er I please,
The stag must needs a mate.

My golden salamander,
You must take me as I am.
I cannot change my colours,
I am but a simple man.

The golden salamander
Had become the rite of spring;
The silver bird made promises
That scarcely meant a thing;
They told the wicked huntsman
Where the stag had run to rest.
Now the elderly survivor
Knew this was not for the best;
He opened up his heart
And prayed for peace for all mankind.
He asked a fortune teller
But found out that she was blind.

The clouds were passing over,
There was little sign of rain;
The sun was slowly rising
From its slumberdown again.
The stag had run to cover
In a copse beside the lake;
The huntsman broke the silence
And the birds began to wake.
The fortune teller smiled
As the survivor spoke of fate.
He thanked her for her interest
But knew it was too late.

The Strawbs,"The willows stand on guard in the dark
Where lovers are rowing alone in the park.
In awe of each other they make a mistake,
And find they must spend one more night on the lake.

And I don't care if anyone knows,
There's no-one so fair as my Tokyo rose.
I don't care if anyone knows,
There's no-one so fair as my Tokyo Rosie.

The blossom has fallen before the west wind;
The butterfly lies with its silken wings pinned;
Alone in the temple the lovers rejoice
And sing to each other with one single voice.

I wear my silk kimono black,
Get you monkey off my back.
No matter where the west wind blows,
You'll never find a fallen rose.

The flowers of heaven are roses in bloom;
The east wind turns west in the walls of my room.
I build my defence in the palace of sin,
The lovers make home and the loser must win.

Who end up drinking tea together
In the afternoon of their lives.

They build their homes upon the seashore
The quicksand castles of their dreams
Yet take no notice of the North wind
Which tears their building at the seams.

In their dismay and blind confusion
The weeping widows clutch their shawls
While as the sea mist ever deepens
The sailors hear the sirens' calls.

And in the maelstrom sea which follows
The lifeboat sinks without a trace
And yet there still remain survivors
To bear the shame of their disgrace.

Last night I lay in bed
And held myself
Trying to remember 
How it once was with you
How your hands were softer.

Yesterday I found myself 
Staring into space
Rather like the sailor
In my own home surroundings
I'm not sure I know me.

If you were me what would you do
Don't tell me I don't need you to
It won't help me now.",Down by the Sea
The Strawbs,"The hillside was a patchwork quilt 
Neatly stitched with tidy hedge 
And crumbling grey stone wall 
The trees were bare, but Spring was near 
To conjure up its endless strings 
Of green magic handkerchieves 

Could you only see what I've seen 
You would surely know what I mean 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven. 

A string of diamonds formed a stream 
That tumbled down the daunting cliff 
To sparkle bright on the beach. 

New born lambs that sweetly played 
Speckled eggs all newly laid 
But for you I would have stayed 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven

That she alone could save him

While realizing he was weak
His life increasingly grew bleak
For all the love she gave to him

While storm clouds gathered high above

As you dry her tearful eyes
You tell her fairy stories

The Strawbs,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Bringing their wives and children. 

A farmer stands with his youngest son 
Watching their sheep driven from the pen 
The slaughterhouse is waiting.

They're frightened 
Dogs are snapping at their heels 
Jumping on each other's backs 
Hear their squeals.

How can they know they're just animals 
Come pull yourself together.

Their blood runs in the gutters.

Farmer beats them with his stick 
Milling by the open door

See people watching blankly 
And he pities them

The Strawbs,"In the early dawn the Bishop's men
Shivered in the damp
But the shiver came not from the cold
And spread throughout the camp

The trembling horses sensed the fear
Of silent thoughtful men
Who prayed that wives and families
Might see them once again

The bishops sent a dawn patrol
To investigate the weight
Of forces at the King's command
Ensconced behind the gate

The ground mist hid the patrol's approach
As they drew close enough to show
The sentries on the battlements
And an archer drew his bow

From the topmost tower a sentry fell
As an arrow pierced his skull
And his headlong flight into the moat
Seemed that of a gull

The patrol reported little
There was nothing much to see
But the strong and silent castle
A symbol of the free

The King's men took communion
As the first rays of the sun
Lit up the castle's gloomy walls
The fatal day begun

From the castle green the rooks took flight
To the high trees in the east
To their carrion minds the battlefield
Set a table for a feast

A tide of black, the Bishop's men
Equality their right
Swarmed like ants across the hill
Their aim at last in sight

The King's men dressed in purest white
Were driven back by force
And the fighting grew more violent
As the battle took its course

The Bishops gave the order
No mercy to be shown
The sacrifice will reap rewards
When the King is overthrown

The sight of children lying dead
Made hardened soldiers weep
The outer walls began to fall
They moved towards the keep

The rooks surveyed the battlefield
Their hungry beady eyes
Reveled in the sight of death
Showing no surprise

The pressure mounted steadily
As the Bishops neared the gate
And the desperate King called to his knights
It's your lives or the State

When the anxious King began to fail
As many thought he might
The Queen ran screaming round the walls
And urged the men to fight

The Bishop's men were tiring
As the afternoon drew late
And the King's men lowered the drawbridge
And poured out through the gate

They fought their way across the bridge
The men like falling leaves
Or ears of corn that fall in swathes
The vicious sickle cleaves

The tide receded up the hill
The waste of reclaimed land
Once decaying swamp became
A shore of pure white sand

A blinded priest was seen to bless
Both dying and the dead
As he stumbled around the battlefield
His cassock running red

If uniform were black or white
His eyes could never see
And death made no distinction
Whatever man he be

As darkness fell both camps withdrew
Their soldiers slain like cattle
Leaving the rooks to feast alone
The victors of the battle

At evensong both camps reviewed
Their sad depleted ranks
As survivors of the battle
Gave God their grateful thanks

Because he said ""Please don't be hasty, no-one understands
But I've got a way to prove it"" and he lifted up his hands.

He was the man who called himself Jesus.

For a minute I was speechless, then I looked into his face
With sufficient lines of sadness for the total human race
And I said ""You must be joking"" but he slowly shook his head
And said ""That's what they all say, I might as well be dead"".

He asked me if I knew a place where he could start to preach
I said ""Well try a church or maybe Brighton beach""
And I was trying to be serious but he didn't seem impressed
He said ""You think I'm crazy, you're just like all the rest"".

I was really quite embarrassed, he was looking so sincere
So I said ""I close the shop soon, won't you come and have a
beer""
Then he asked me if I meant it and he smiled a funny smile
And he said he'd rather like that and he hung arounds a while.

On the way he stopped to pat little children's heads
And he taught them one line prayers to say as they went off to their beds
But mostly they were frightened and they looked at him wide eyed
And when he said his name was Jesus, one girl even cried.

In the pub I asked him if he'd tried to see the Pope
And he said although he'd thought about it there was really not a hope
Then he said he thought he'd better go, he had some work to do
He said he'd come and see me in about a week or two.

Well after he had gone I thought of what he'd said

My fingers grew like branches
I stood rooted to the ground
And the spell is still unbroken
I am still her bidden slave
Till a casket from the witchwood
Bears my body to the grave.

The Strawbs,"Go to sleep my babies 
Don't you wake up 
The stars will keep you company 
So close your eyes 
Old Uncle Moon will shine his dearest sweetest dreams 
And hold you in your arms 
Until the morning comes. 

Night Light 

Dark the night, not a sound 
Damp and cold, frosty ground 
Above your head the lion screams 
To tear you from your moonlit dreams. 

Damp with sweat, mouth is dry 
Twisted branches catch the eye 
Beside your bed the angel stands 
You cannot touch his withered hands. 

Guardian Angel 

As the lion's eyes dance before me 
They are kindly yet bloody red 
I can see that he is smiling 
But I cannot live inside his head. 

There the needle stands before me 
I climb inside it towards the light 
Where the angel stands in glory 
His sword of peace defends the night. 

So the world is spread before 
As I fly high on angel wings 
But the angel is deceiving 
For he is weeping as he sings. 

Night Light (continued) 

Early birds, morning breeze 
Spinning leaves, sleepy trees 
Gently tap the window pane 
It's good to see the sun again.

The Strawbs,"If in some capricious moment
I should give you cause to fear
Then you have but to remember

That my being here is mere fortune
For the rules have laid down
To guide the thoughts of those who stray

If in some deserted hour
We should murmur last goodbyes
With the snowflakes falling softly
As the tears well in your eyes

Then we kiss but once and walk away
Never turning round
And the snow falls on our footsteps
Leaving nothing to be found

And my life is yet determined
By the span of what it holds
And the span grows ever shorter
As my lifetime folds away

I sit around and wonder
About your new love affair
That's what you call lookin' back

Leanin' back on my chair in a greasy spoon cafeteria

But again we're back in like a day
Chattin' shit sittin' at the wall table telling jokes
Playin with the salt looking out the window
Girl brings two plates of full English over
With plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato
Get my phone out about give this girl a shout
See if she had a nice time last night uptown
Ask if she fancy's tryin' it again some time
Then Cal grabs the phone like oy!oy!oy!oy!

Hold it down boy, your head's getting blurred
I know you can't stop thinking of her
By all means, you can vibe with this girl

No! No! No!  I mean, I'll fuckin', I'm no way really tryin'
I mean I'll fuckin', I can take it or leave it, believe

Quit starin' into space and eat your snack that's that

Whether it's off or on, or on, or off or on?

Oy, do you really think I act whack

Perfectly in control of this goal, I've got the lead role

The Streets,"Hello, Hello. My names Terry and I'm a law abider 
There's nothing I like more than getting fired up on beer 
And when the weekends here I to exercise my right to get paralytic and fight 
Good bloke fairly 
But I get well leery when geezers look at me funny 
Bounce 'em round like bunnies 
I'm likely to cause mischief 
Good clean grief you must believe and I ain't no thief. 
Law abiding and all, all legal. 
And who cares about my liver when it feels good 
What you need is some real manhood. 
Rasher Rasher Barney and Kasha putting peoples backs up. 
Public disorder, I'll give you public disorder. 
I down eight pints and run all over the place 
Spit in the face of an officer 
See if that bothers you cause I never broke a law in my life 
Someday I'm gonna settle down with a wife 
Come on lads lets have another fight 

Eh hello. My names Tim and I'm a criminal, 
In the eyes of society I need to be in jail 
For the choice of herbs I inhale. 
This ain't no wholesale operation 
Just a few eighths and some Playstations my's vocation 
I pose a threat to the nation 
And down the station the police hold no patients 
Let's talk space and time 
I like to get deep sometimes and think about Einstein 
And Carl Young And old Kung Fu movies I like to see 
Pass the hydrator please 
Yeah I'm floating on thin air. 
Going to Amsterdam in the New Year - top gear there 
'Cause I taker pride in my hobby 
Home made bongs using my engineering degree 
Dear Leaders, please legalize weed for these reasons. 

Like I was saying to him. 
I told him: ""Top with me and you won't leave."" 
So I smacked him in the head and downed another Carling 
Bada Bada Bing for the lad's night. 
Mad fight, his face's a sad sight. 
Vodka and Snake Bite. 
Going on like a right geez, he's a twat, 
Shouldn't have looked at me like that. 
Anyway I'm an upstanding citizen 
If a war came along I'd be on the front line with em. 
Can't stand crime either them hooligans on heroin. 
Drugs and criminals those thugs on the penny colored will be the downfall of society 
I've got all the anger pent up inside of me. 

You know I don't see why I should be the criminal 
How can something with no recorded fatalities be illegal 
And how many deaths are there per year from alcohol 
I just completed Gran Tourismo on the hardest setting 
We pose no threat on my settee 
Ooh the pizza's here will someone let him in please 
""We didn't order chicken, Not a problem we'll pick it out 
I doubt they meant to mess us about 
After all we're all adults not louts."" 
As I was saying, we're friendly peaceful people 
We're not the ones out there causing trouble. 
We just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters 
Discussing how beautiful Gail Porter is. 
MTV, BBC Two, Channel Four is on until six in the morning. 
Then at six in the morning the sun dawns and it's my bedtime. 

Causing trouble, your stinking rabble 
Boys saying I'm the lad who's spoiling it 
You're on drugs it really bugs me when people try and tell me I'm a thug 
Just for getting drunk 
I like getting drunk 
'Cause I'm an upstanding citizen 
If a war came along I'd be on the front line with 'em. 

Now Terry you're repeating yourself 
But that's okay drunk people can't help that. 
A chemical reaction inside your brain causes you to forget what you're saying. 

What. I know exactly what I'm saying 
I'm perfectly sane 
You stinking student lameo 
Go get a job and stop robbing us of our taxes. 

Err, well actually according to research 
Government funding for further education pales in insignificance 
When compared to how much they spend on repairing 
Leery drunk people at the weekend 
In casualty wards all over the land.

I'm gonna batter you. Come here.",The Irony of It All
The Streets,"She said 'Meet me at the gates at eight
'Leave now, don't be late'
She said one day she'd walk away
'Cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say 'Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate'
Tempting fate
We first met through a shared view
She loved me and I did too
It's now seven-fifty
Getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly
Step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money
I've got two Henrys and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees
From my reeking jeans
Got a 'you-think-I-care' air
Out glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near
All of the silence after the tears

[Chorus]
I didn't know it was over
Till it was too late, too ate
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

She said 'Meet me at the gates, don't be late'
But pretty soon the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear
She'd been there with a fixed stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezers' stares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain
Smiling and shouting
Spring flowers sprouting
Not one inch of doubt in my mind
As I reached the gates
Came around the corner at a rate
Risked her love
But I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late [x3]

[Chorus]

I said meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late
I waited for a while
Listening to her voice mail
Mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain, hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away
Too little to late
I step up the pace
Walk past the gate
Rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
In the chase, I sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drown in my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
'Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance

But remember I'm just spitting, remember I'm just spitting
Once bitten, forever smitten

The Streets,"Smell of good earthy herbs makes my nerves shudder but where were you that cold December 
'Cause we were in the Grasshopper spending guilders 
Central Station, charged up like Scarface Amsterdam ain't a nice place off your face, we 
Enter the race 
Walk down, been there before, done that, no joy, if you're bored, let's go see Roy, get 
Fucked up with the boys 
Calvin, Schmalvin, I'm well within my limit, oh hang on a minute, these mushrooms just 
Kicked in, think I might be finished 
The ball game heads for the worse, for what it's worth I might just fall off the edge of 
The earth, brain's kind of surfing now 
We wander down darkened pathways in a daze, ""Want to buy any cocaine?"", am I paranoid? ""Yes, 
You're paranoid"" 
Charlie, darling, please save me, this is raving, take me home to my baby, two bags of 
Mushrooms, room's mushed up and I need a cradle

In its own little way, my body was trying to say that you better stop drinking brandy 

Now getting to the bar's gonna be trouble 
So the Marlons'll have to be doubles 
Then you drink doubles 
The same speed you drink singles 
Ah beautiful, the barman holds aloft the crystal glass and I'm having all that's in the 
Bubble in the bottom of the bottle 
Then by three or four, your head's a bit mangled 
Club's full, you mingle 
You dance the fandango 
You sing all your favorite jingles 
Far gone on one, call me Baron Von Marlon 
One has a monocle and cigar 
Dickie-bow and long johns 
My utility belt tells me it's to the bar Batman 
Fat cans of that lager then it's straight to the dance-floor 
For much more fancy footwork, it's adored by many amour 
Don't awe me with your little sidestep technique 
Get to the beat, loosen up, it's The Streets

We eat junk food, sat drunk on the tube 
Every time the train clunks I feel like puking 
Wonder whether that beautiful bird'll ring, 
Then it all goes hazy, these are the days we're walking up out and back to the road, talking 
Well shouting actually, loads more drunk, by Jove, mind's focused, balance fucked up 
Ra, ra, ra, it's all back to the Dogstar and if it's his round I'm quite partial to another 
Marlon at the bar 
Bad idea to start again late, should've given my brain a break 
Take it easy mate, you start to think you're a state, you definitely are a state

The Streets,"That's it, turn the page on the day, walk away
'Cause there's sense in what I say
I'm forty-fifth generation Roman
But I don't know 'em or care when I'm spitting
So return to your sitting position and listen
It's fitting, I'm miles ahead and they chase me
Show your face on TV then we'll see, you can't do half
My crew laughs at your rhubarb-and-custard verses
You rain down curses but I'm waving your hearses driving by
Streets riding high with the beats in the sky
All stare, eyes glazed, garage burnt down
The fire raged for forty days and in forty ways
But through the blaze they see it fade
The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces
Then a figure emerges from the wastage
Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze
One hand clutching his sword raised to the sky
They wonder how, they wonder why
The sky turns white, it all becomes clear
They felt lifted from their fears
They shed tears, in the light after six dark years
Young bold soldiers, the fire burns, crackles and smolders
Five years older and wiser
The fires are burning, on fire, never tire
Slay warriors in the forests, and on higher we sing
Hear the strings rising, the war's over, the bells ring
Memories fading, soldiers slaying, looks like geezers raving
The hazy fog over the bullring, the lazy ways the birds sing
A new baby's born everyday, few men may be scorned today
But look at things the other way cause it may well be your final day
And then crowds roar, they slay, they all say
I produced this using only my bare wit
Give me a jungle, a garage beat, and admit defeat
Use war and past injuries, my metaphor is simile
Get all applications in to me before the deadline
'Cause it's a fine line between strife full time and a life of crime
But you will reach the day
And it's all mine, you can take it or leave it
I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix
In the afterlife gladiators meet their maker
Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water
To the next life from the fortress
Away from the knives and slaughter, to their wives and daughters
Once more before the Lord judges over all of us
It's in the is place you'll see me
Brace yourself cause this goes deep
I'll show you the secrets to sky and the birds
Actions speak louder than words
Stand by me, my apprentice
Be brave, clench fists",Turn the Page
The Streets,"Turn left up the street
Nothing but gray concrete and deadbeats
Grab something to eat, Mickey D's or KFC
Only one choice in the city, don't voice in my pity
Now let's get to the nitty gritty
June reminds me of my first ditty played unique
Still 16 and feeling horny
Point the sky and feel free
See, people are all equal
Smiles are front and behind me
Swim in the deep blue sea corn fields sway lazily
All smiles all easy
Where ya from, what ya on and what's ya story?
Mezmorizing tones rising pianos, this is my zone so stop cloning
Pick paper scissors or stone 'cause me and you are the same
I known you all my life I don't know your name
(The name's European Bob Sordid, anyway)
We'll have a dance now see ya later
Pleased to meet ya - likewise, a pleasure
We all smile
We all sing

The night slowly fades and goes slow motion
All the commotion becomes floating emotions
Same piano loops over, arms wave eyes roll back
And jaws fall open, see it's a focus
Enchanted is blocking the toilets
Dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
These people are for life
So, back to his place at the end of the night
Yo, they could settle wars with this
If only they will, imagine the world's leaders on pills
And imagine the morning after, falls causing disaster
Don't talk to me I don't know ya, but this ain't tomorrow
For now I still love ya, hours fly over
Sail around diamonds and pearls
Never seen so many thick girls
Discover new worlds, look at my watch can't focus
Last two hours are lost every move fills me with lust
All of Life's problems I just shake off
Yo, mad little events happen
Things might pan out in a few blue
Maddens are like the toilets
Big beefy bouncers out to reveal us
Geezers aren't easy first timers
Kids on wiz darlings on Charlie
All come together for this party
All races many faces from places you never heard of
Where ya from, what's ya name and what ya want?
Sing to the words fecks to the fat ones
The tribal drums the sun's rising
We all smile
We all sing

Then the girl in the cafe taps me on the shoulder
I realize five years went by and I'm older
Memories smolder, winter's colder
But that same piano loops over and over and over
The road shines and the rain washes away
Same Chinese take-away selling shit in a tray
Stalk all around I walk down same sights same sounds
New beats, though, solid concrete under my feet
No surprises no treats
The world stands still as my mind slushes around
The washer nut bolt in my crown
The life's been up and down since I walked from that crowd
We all smile
We all sing

Out of respect for Johnnie Walker, Paul Oakenfold, Nicky Holloway
Danny Rampling and all the people who gave us these times
And to the government, I stick my middle finger up
With regards to the criminal justice bill

For all the heroes out and on the way

He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
This time I know I'm gonna smash the bet 
I foresee it smacked in the back of the net 
Men grip slips, wipe their hands that sweat 
The camera pans the away fans end 
Twenty quid for blues to thrash the reds 
Then cash that cash, when the ref has said 
My mates out, his pads a mess 
Its getting late, I've not dashed yet 
The question I have to ask myself 
Is can I see us not battering them? 
If I cant see that, happening then 
I'm gonna put all my money down on one fat bet 
Now I don't know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, that's a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
This time I know I woulda cashed the lot 
I woulda held in my hand the whole jackpot 
The games won, the ends have a swap 
2-0 up they're getting mashed up 
But I wont win now, the chance flopped 
Cause I couldn't make it to the damn shop 
Might as well put tea in that pot 
Ive got nowhere else I have to bop 
The question I have to ask one 
Is how I managed, not to manage the trot 
Maybe I could phone in and slap it on 
Put all my money on a mid-match one 
Yes, I don't know the first thing about football 
But my instincts tell me this is my windfall 
It's his lucky day, that's a given 
He'll tick the box on the slip, and then just watch and learn 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But this is gonna pay, he feels it this one'll be fine 
Shit, I'm mad glad I didn't back that match 
Suppose to be an unproblematic catch 
Full time the whistle blasted after 
The last passer, passed the last pass 
Would you believe how we fell back 
Three goals lost in the last half 
So glad I was stranded back at the flat 
Wincing at every goal we let em have 
The question I now have to ask 
Is how the fuck did we get smashed that bad? 
I just very, very nearly, nearly 
Lost every penny of all my cash 
Yes, I don't know the first thing about football 
And my instincts almost led me to a pitfall 
It's his lucky day, that was barmy 
He didn't tick the box on the slip, and what a relief 
He's not addicted, he can stop anytime 
But next time he will be more lucky, next time he'll be fined

I need to rethink the technique of my betting shit 
Maybe change the parameters a little bit 
Instead of betting on to win the football 
I'll bet to lose the cricket",***Not Addicted***
The Streets,"That's the one, oy
How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe?
Way too close for me, oh well at least they allowed me through
Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room
People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

They said they'd be here they said, they said in the corner
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

These look well speckly, bit of green and blue
Threes is well cheap though, so I'll take three if I need to
Right I'm on the plan, I wish the bouncers would go away
Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

That's proper rank, that tastes like hairspray
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone
You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned?
Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone?
Send message, Dan's number, where've they gone?
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya?
And I'm thinking

Hmm, brandy or beer? Water's a good idea
Wish that bar lady'd appear and come serve over here
Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner
This nights a tragedy, I keep thinking I saw her
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

No that's not them, that's not them either
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud
It's been ages since I necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub
Belly's not even tingling, I just feel a bit pissed
No-one looks like mingling, I can't see her or him
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

I'm gonna do another I think, Yeah, one more, these are shit
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door
Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin' so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here 'til dawn
Sure my belly's tingling a bit, somethings happening I'm sure
And I'm thinking

Lights are blinding my eyes

Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one, I feel all fidgety and warm

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, I think I'm going to fall down
My heart's beating to quick, I'm fucking tripping out
I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt
Who cares, there is a tune coming in, that one noise is like

My eyes are rolling back, I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
And I'm thinking

People pushing by, and walking off into the night

Yeah yeah they cheer
Can they see my hand in the air?
Need to wave 'em over here
Swear Simone's kissing Dan
My head is twisted sever, body's rushing everywhere
They could have texted me when they were near, but I'm fucked and I don't
Care

This is fucking amazing",Blinded by the Lights
The Streets,"'Cause her last relationship fucked her up
Got hurt majorly, finds it tough to trust
Looked at the ashtray, then looked back up
Spinnin' it away on the tabletop
She looked much fitter than Saturday just
She worked in JD's with Dan
Back then I figured she was pretty damn rough
But she was only wearin' her work stuff
And in these clothes she looked more than buff
She stirred her straw, sat up to adjust
I told her I thought it was important
That you could get lost in conversation
Chattin' shit, sittin' in, oblivion
With that person who's your special one
She said she was the worst pool player under the sun
But blokes go easy so she always won

[Chorus]
I saw this thing on ITV the other week
Said, that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen
She's playin' with her hair, well regularly
So I reckon I could well be in

She didn't look too bored with what I was sayin'
Her hair looked much better than the other day
She had her fingers 'round her hair, playin'
I Saw on the telly that's a good indication
Stood up to buy the next drink though, ""Nay.""
Suppose that's just our girl's way
I'm tryin' to think what else I could say
Peelin' the label off, spinnin' the ashtray
Yeah actually, yes, she did look pretty neat
Her perfume smelled expensive and sweet
I felt like my hair looked a bit cheap
Wished I'd had it cut back last week
She kept givin' me this look, cause she would speak
Was she only friendly, or was she a keep?
Asked her if she wanted the same again to drink
Started to turn and get up out my seat

[Chorus]

She said that her close mates all were
Always the most important thing to her
I said I thought it was a bit more blurred
She asked what I meant by that as she stirred
I told her about the money and what had occurred
With it goin' missing from the living room, so
With my best mates all there standin' by
Right where I left it, under their eyes
So surely one of them might have spied
What happened to my money at that time
I felt like they were all smilin' on the side
She was like ""fair play"" she couldn't say why
She didn't know what all my mates were like
And I said she just might be right
Wish I had someone I could always rely
Someone to get lost chattin' to all night

[Chorus]

As I walked back with more drinks to our place
She had her phone stuck to the side of her face
I sat for a minute while she chatted away
'Bout somethin' with her mom and her birthday
Played for a bit with the same ashtray
Thought about things while I sat and waited
It was nice to chat about the shit in my head
Someone who just listens to you instead
I looked at the barman, wiping down again
Looked at the football on the TV set
Tryin' to look like I weren't just waitin' there
For her conversation to come to an end
I look at my watch and realized right then
That, for three hours, been in conversation
Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent
And we carried on chattin' for more than that again

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",Could Well Be In
The Streets,"In one single moment your whole life can turn around, I stand there for a minute staring straight into the ground.
Looking to the left slightly then looking back down the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown. 
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us, I can change and I can grow or we can adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. 
We can even have an open relationship if we must. 
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me. 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity, when they opened up she's lookin down at her feet.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

So then I moved my hand off and down by my side, shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes.
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies, touched the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh.
Because I can't imagine my life without you and me, there's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing.
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely, please please, I'm begging, please.
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with.
She peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures, by pushing my hand away to my chest from hers.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

And I'm just standing there.
I can't say a word.
'Cause everything has just gone.
I've got nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation, put my arms around her to try to change what she's saying.
Put my head level with hers so she might engage in.
Look into her eyes to make her listen again, I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' just leave it all now.
'cause you said it would be forever and that was your vow, and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down.
Your well out of order now, this is well out of town.
She pulls away, my arms that are tightly clamped around her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight.
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face, takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away.

[Chorus]

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.

I know in the past I've found it hard to say, telling you things but not telling you straight. But the more I pull on your hand the more you pull away.

Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now.",Dry Your Eyes
The Streets,"If I want to sit in and drink super tenants in the day I will
No one's going to fucking tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world?
No, you can't
It's not my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
Everyone wanted this to all go wrong for me from the start
It's fucked up that a man's life can just be attacked
Watching this morning with a beer
Is much better than relying on
Unknown cunts for mates I was given
That don't have my back
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
But I laid it down telling him to fuck right off chap
Phoned this company out the yellow pages
Told them to take away the TV and fix it quick snap
The next day they took away the TV
Told me they would repair the little bit
That's broken round on the back
I thought that would be that but the next bit was on top
This was where it all started to get a bit out of hand

The TV man comes back later, knocks on mine
To say he's found something in the back of the TV
I'm looking at it absolutely speechless, can't quite believe
He's trying to pull this fucking stunt on me
I knew it was a simple case of the power supply gone on the back
But he's trying to tap me up for more money
He says it's not like that and I'm like ""Fuck off and die!""
And stick up my two fingers and one more to make three
He says ""Don't talk to me like that"", and I don't understand
My face is in his face, I tell him I understand perfectly
And he grabs my shirt and I grab his face with my hand
So he brings his fist up and twats me a good one on my cheek
Now I'm trying to pull his head down so I can knee it
But he's got my ear
He's twisting it round so much that it's
Really hurting me
And we both go down on the floor, and he pushes my head back
Onto the corner of the fridge which is, total agony
Then he gets up and runs out the kitchen, and out of the door
Shouting stuff to me, slams his door, shouting at me
So here I am in my house, drinking on my own settee
Everyone's a cunt in this life, no one's there for me

[Chorus 1]

If I want to sit in and drink super tenants in the day I will
No one's going to fucking tell me jack
But can you rely on anyone in this world?
No, you can't
It's all my fault there's wall-to-wall empty cans
I sat in the kitchen all fucked off
Imagining over and over what they're all doing behind my back
Dodgy things going on, actions I regretted
Stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat
Scott texted me to say he'd have a look at the TV for me
And I felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap
But what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates
And then opting to stay out? It seemed to match
But I told him he could make it up by fixing the TV
He said that's the least he could do to square things flat
I thought that would be that but then the next bit was mad
This is where everything started to all turn back

[Chorus 2]
The end of the something I did not want to end
Beginning of hard times to come
But something that was not meant to be is done
And this is the start of what was

He had to unscrew about fifteen screws
Before he could pull the panel off the back
To get in the fecking thing
But just as he did so, he said he saw something
That slipped inside behind the panel
Down the back of it
Must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe
I didn't want to lose the bill in case it was a final warning
So we both tried to get the back off and work out
If there was any more screws to get out
Or if we left any in
And when he looked down the back of the TV his eyes just froze
Before he rammed his hand in, saying, ""No shit!""
He's looking at me absolutely speechless
He can't quite believe what he's trying to pull, out the slip
I get up wondering what he's smiling about
He's shaking his head at this point with, the biggest of grins
I look down the back of the TV and that's where it was
In all its glory?my thousand quid

[Chorus 2]

About two this afternoon the last of the people left my house
'Cause they never stop chatting 'til all the rackets gone
I really feel like things clicked into place at some point
Or maybe it's the fact that me and Alison really got on
Or maybe it's that I realized that it is true
No one's really there fighting for you in the last garrison
No one except yourself that is
No one except you
You are the one who's got your back 'til the last deeds done
Scott can't have my back 'til the absolute end
'Cause he's got to look out for what over his horizon
He's gotta make sure he's not lonely, not broke
It's enough to worry about keeping his own head above
I shut the door behind me, huddled up in my coat
Condensation floating off my breath, squinted out the sun
My jeans feel a bit tight, think I washed them too high
I was gonna be late, so I picked up my pace to run

The Streets,"Excuse me girl
I know its a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines..
On your shirt!

See I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers time
That blue top shop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan though - but yeah you score high
But there's just one little thing that really really
Really really annoying me about you you see
Yeah yeah like I said you are really fit

Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard
I was waiting in the que looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a Burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction
Your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which cost me my place in the queue I waited for yeah

[Chorus]

Whoa! Leave it out
Are you smoking something?
Leave it out
Mike just leave it just leave it
We cannot have that behavior in this establishment
S'not worth it mike, just leave it
Don't touch me, s'not worth it
Don't touch me, D, look 'm alright don't touch me

For a while there I was thinkin' - yeah but what if?
Picturin' myself pullin' with bare white hot wit
Snarin' you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clockin' onto you too yeah I had to admit
That yeah yeah you are fit
And yeah I do want it
But I stop sharkin' for a minute to get chips and drinks

[Chorus]

Oy, just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smilin' hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty hearty lookin' tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that white shirted man

[Chorus]

Oh what do I give .. I've got a girlfriend anyway
(whoa, we've all had a drink mate)
We're all a bit drunk, yeah we've had a few fair play
I got this Stella I bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun, yes yes oh yay
I did fancy you a bit though yeah I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
On otherwise a total result of a holiday

[Chorus]",Fit But You Know It
The Streets,"I'm about to do something crazy, you'll regret this, I swear
This one time I really needed you to head over mine where
I was throwing up all morning, it was all in my hair
Then because I was so dizzy I almost fell down the stairs
Like you always do, you know, you just don't fucking care

[Chorus]
Go, get out of my house, please
Actually give me back my keys, but
I'll be proper angry, if
You're not back later on your knees

Look
Come on, calm down, it wasn't all totally like that
You're over-reacting just a bit, maybe we can sit down and chat
It's just, you know, I had stuff to do, you know, this and that
Maybe it wasn't so important as you being in the sack
But I had to sort out my pills man; I needed to stock up my stash
I couldn't do it any other day, I had to do it then, quick snap
And you didn't want me there last Sat., so I left you on your jack
And this Saturday I thought it was the same deal as last Sat. at your gaff

[Chorus]

You don't care about my broken TV
I sit on my sofa all day smoking weed
I never phoned that bloke from the TV company
So please don't be like this, please, please, please

Actually now I think about it, what am I guilty about?
I felt like I was in the wrong, I felt like I was the lout
Oy, this is what happened last Saturday now, I think I remember now
You were ill last Saturday and two weeks before that little bout
You know I need that medication for my epilepsy now
Or I run the risk of having a fit, you know I can't go without
So when you being in bed is because last night you got pissed
It's you that's being selfish, it's you that don't give a shit

I'm gone, I'll get out your house, then
I'll never, be back again, but
I'll still be 'ceiving when, you
Text me to make up and be friends

[ad libs to end]",Get Out of My House
The Streets,"It was supposed to be so easy...

Just take back the DVD
Withdraw that extra money
Tell mum I wouldn't be back for tea
Then grab my savings and hurry
So first to get the film back in time
To avoid that big fine
I had to do a fast hill climb
But a faster decline
But I flew a bit quick
Arms like a lunatic
Had to stop for a few ticks
I started feeling sick
Got to the video shop in a state
But chuffed it, wouldn't be late
Only when he flicked open the case
I'd left the disc at my place

[Chorus]
Today I have achieved absolutely naught
In just being out of the house, I've lost out
If I wanted to end up with more now
I should have just stayed in bed like I know how

So I failed on the DVD
But I still had to get the money
Tell mum I couldn't make tea
Get the savings and then hurry
Rushin' to the cash machine
Still a bit mashed and lean
Then of course a mandatory car
Drives by and splashes me
Get there the queue's outrageous
Ladies taking ages
My rage is blowing gauges
How long's it take to validate your wages?
At last my turn comes
Press the 50 squid button: Insufficient funds

[Chorus]

So I failed on the DVD
Couldn't withdraw any money
But I still had to call mum
Get the savings, and then hurry
So to call mum so that
I could tell her I can't go and that
At least I remembered my phone, man
I didn't know her number offhand
Where's my phone, have I got it?
Oh this is a crock of shit!
I lost the fucking thing
Wait, wait, it's in my pocket
But the batteries nearly flat
Got to call, quick snap
Aww shit, the battery is flat

[Chorus]

So I've failed on the DVD
Couldn't withdraw any money
Or call mum about tea
I'll have to get the savings and hurry
But where was the money?
I knew I'd left it on the
Side, next to the telly
This is not even funny
I left it in the living room
Ready to pick up as soon
As I passed through
On the way out to the rendezvous
So the shoebox full of money
Just disappearing from me
That's not what I call funny
+A grand don't come for free+

[Chorus]

Oy, soaked to the bone in me jeans
You want me to stop?
I imagine my mum's weeping right now
And the thousand pounds you swore
That I left on the table this morn
Has simply disappeared before my eyes, his eyes, and yours
And I'm a thousand pounds poorer
Hundred thousand pennies, no more
A thousandth of a million squid
Or two monkeys
Or a whole fifty scores
Gone, withdrawn, from my life
The money is no more for sure

It was supposed to be so easy...",It Was Supposed to Be So Easy
The Streets,"Yeah safe man, you okay? Just calling to ensure you got back in
Hope you coped yesterday 'coz I felt well damn grim
But yeah in the air on the plane my stomach was turning
Man I was hanging head-to-stead on the headrest in pain

Prayin' away all my bad sins
Lost count of the plain Chardonnays before the fourth or maybe the fifth
In future I need to abstain, if only I'd had a bit of discipline
But worth every bit of spare change, pure clowning down to the last drink

Hang on let me slam the door, mate
Just pause that thought for a bit

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that?
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

I've been pacing the place
Well paralyzed since I got back in with my bags though
Yeah I'm too aware that last night was way mad slack, I know
Carried in a gang I lost sight of Simone on her own, back at home

Distracted from the fact it weren't right
Could have raised up the hand but no
Simone was moaning and
That about me playing away on this holiday

She was watching the box at her Dad's house
There preparing spliffs away
As I'm smacking glasses down at George
Best, best session rate

Can you hear me? Na sorry mate
You're fuzzy mate, I can't hear you

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

So, I lost you for a minute, yeah, yeah I can hear you now
See I mean that the true thing though I suppose I chose myself to allow
I was weak and stupid but as far as I viewed anyhow
She couldn't have been it for me the only girl I'd ever go out with

I didn't want to waste my youth in a girl's house to the sound of spliffs
And when she got in a mood with me in that text about that thing
I just switched off the phone when she started shouting
Coming to a conclusion I couldn't be bothered with anymore rowing

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat
(Nah nah nah)

And then after shots made me lose the plot, it all got a bit bizarre
And that incident with the ice cream I forgot, it all ended in our vodka
What I can remember is a blotch, I got a fat bruise on my arm

She weren't even much too hot but she totally mugged me up like rah
She knew exactly what she was doing and it all went a bit too far
She was with that bloke in the white top in Mcdonalds' car park
And then she let me chat her up later on in that lovely little bar

Hello? Ahh fucking phones, man!

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

Yeah I think we got cut off, yeah I got crap reception in my house
I have to stand in a certain spot in my kitchen or it cuts out
Yeah you know I was potty to even let myself allow it
I would if I could just swap what happened then for right now

And if she ever found out how far it got it would be more than just a row
This whole thing just got on top but it's her that I want, no doubt
So in a way its helped me doing wrong, I know I've fucked up now
This is where that dodgy shit stops, she's just gotta not find out

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

Why did I have to go and do a stupid thing like that
'Coz yeah it felt like we were through though
But I could've ruined it, I'm such a twat

Draped over the edge of that dusty chair 
All fits into place suddenly 
Yeh my coat was hangin' up under my stairs 
But one day it went leaving the cupboard bare 
The facts all click in and become square 
He stole it while I was unaware 
But why's he denying it when it's so bate 
Looking at the telly, won't look over straight 
Why's he not flappin' and explaining away? 
To one very fuckin' frustrated mate 
Dan's been trustin' every word Scott says 
He believes in mates so fair play

This must all look a bit weird 
It's Mike's C.P coat sittin' here 
Draped over the chair 
So that it appears to all fit me up suddenly 
And clear I'm gonna have to just try and volunteer 
An answer 'bout the man who left the bomber here 
He must've picked it up from Mikes dear 
Girls house When the weather wasn't clear 
The man must've thought it was Simone's coat 
We didn't think it was Mike's coat though 
I can't just deny it 'cause my face shows 
Lookin' at the telly's not aidin', no 
I can't tell Mike this man didn't know 
And innocently borrowed the coat at Simone's 
'cause then Mike would demand to know 
Why this man was even at Simone's 
[Mike] That frown could mean anything 
[Wayney G] What the fuck am I gonna do now? 
He know's I'm lyin'

What the fuck's he saying she had the garm' 
Either he has gone John Barnes 
Or he's tryin' to spin me a con's yarn 
He think's he's the fucking don gar 
How long have I undergone his smarm? 
Shruggin' it all off as fun charm 
If he don't stop lookin' at the TV though 
I'm gonna wrap the cable round his wee throat 
Hang on Scott says Simone had the coat 
Where did he see her on the d.low 
What is it I don't need to know? 
Is he scheming to be near Simone? 
In the club I wondered what was on the go 
Dan was tryin' to keep Scott from being close 
And Scott teefed me money and his teefed me coat 
And he's trying to steal me girlfriend from under me nose

Right I can't be bothered with this no more 
I'm gonna have to tell him I owe him the score 
I wish I could tell him about the dough on the draws 
That's somethin' I don't know, I swore 
The coat thing will look dodgy loads more 
If I don't throw it down as the crow soars 
I'd better put the video on pause 
Face up toe-to-toe over the floor 
He really needs to know how his jacket 
Miraculously appeared round my gaff, here 
And the man that left it's been shagging 
Mike's girl behind Mike's back and thing 
This shit's all got a bit out of hand

The Streets,"I should be standing at the bar, waving a ten pound note around
But I sit here on the sofa at my girl's house
I should be chatting shit as I'm nubbing out another snout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV for now
I should be watching the fruit machines, for which one will pay out
But I sit on the sofa at my girls, anyhow
I should be legging it from a cab, like a mad little lout
But I'll roach a spliff watching the TV, throughout

[Chorus]
I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
I'm always thinking loads about her
She's the best thing that ever happened to me, and
I don't know what I'd do without her

I should actually go out and about, flip some beer mats
Instead of sitting her at my girl's gaff
'Cause, all I seem to do is sit in this habitat
Just roaching a spliff, watching the TV and that
And the TV at my house is a bit broken on the back
So I use my girl's TV to watch the match
Yeah, I, might head out later to get off this beaten track
Of, watching the TV, roaching up, I'm the same old man

[Chorus]

But on second thought, so why don't you shots
No, I, think, I, will, sit on the sofa
And eat my TV meal
I would actually much prefer to just sit here and chill
Roaching a spliff, watching East-Enders or the Bill
'Cause basically I love her, and I love being here still
And I love sitting on the sofa with my girl, for real
I don't want to knock my mates
But there it's the same old drill
Roaching a spliff, watching the TV is my will

[Chorus]

No fuck that
I might ask my mates where they'll be drinking
From the sofa giving them a ding
Tell 'em, I will go freeze on that ground later on this evening
Instead of roaching a spliff, watching the TV again
And then go out
Whilst back at her's, she does her ting
Sitting on the sofa at her end
But, as I watch the big screen I know I will quite miss
Me and her roaching a spliff, watching the TV again

I know I never tell her, but every single day, man
 I'm always thinking loads about her
(That's exactly what I'm talking about)
She's the best thing that ever happened to me

And I don't know what I'd do without her

I know I never tell her

But every single day, man

I'm always thinking loads about her

'Cause everything's just gone
I've got nothin', absolutely nothin'

In one single moment your whole life can turn 'round
I stand there for a minute starin' straight into the ground
Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down
World feels like it's caved in proper sorry frown

Please let me show you where we could only just be for us
I can change and I can grow or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship, if you must

I look at her she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's lookin' straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

So then I move my hand up from down by my side
It's shakin', my life is crashin' before my eyes
Turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh

There's things I can't imagine doin', things I can't imagine seein'
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely

She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers

Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up

Leave now don't be late
She said one day she'd walk away 'cause I'm always late
Thought things were o.k.

We first met through a shared view, she loved me and I did too

Standing at the top of this huge mountain, smiling and shouting
Spring flowers sprouting, not one inch of doubt in my mind as I reached the gates
Came round the corner at a rate
Risked her love but I'm gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late
Never again am I gonna be late

Leave now don't be late
I waited for a while listening to her voice mail, mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale, wind rain and hail
My fears unveiled, for my fair female
She'd walked away, too little too late
I step up the pace, walk past the gates, rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place in the chase
Sat down I got a fat frown
Weeping and drowning my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance

Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford

With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like nah, i can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smilin' hard suggestin' and

The Streets,"Can you blatantly say looking straight in her face
That you aren't telling tales to her.

If you never tell a lie to her,
You don't have to remember anything,
It all goes out the window when,
I try to do it myself,

Can you blatantly say looking straight in her face that you aint telling tales to her.
That you never get stressed when she questions events you'll be best to forget.
Can you actually blag when the lamb glances when you prang and your chatting,
That if you had the chance to go back to her pad for a passionate act you wouldn't have it?
Oi, why's that then?

Its 'cause the reason you been faithful is
Its been so good
You never seen temptation
Deep down you hear the mans burden
We all have a mans burden
You'll always be a bad person

It's getting you down
You were letting her down,
You were tempted and failed.
You showed her up,
You need to be owning up you need to show her you love her for once.
It was an extreme circumstance it was she that advanced
She defeated you gradually
So you must then be honest you must then get on this.
Mend the wrong shit.

If you never tell a lie to her,
You don't have to remember anything,
It all goes out the window when,
I try to do it myself

Oi oi, so why you wanna phone up?
Why you wanna own up?
You were selfish and so dumb.
To ease it off your chest, to be relieved of the mess that's being proper selfish,
I been in some broken moments I know what goes on the road but there's a road you chose however coked
Up your brain you know you chose to strain you know it was your game oi

But it makes you see things clearer
It was weird though man
But you didn't wanna be with her
Seriously back home
If a girl was to even hear
It would spare her weak heart
She have no fear

The chance to see the fit thing naked will spell and memorize you.
You'll disregard the ways the lady in your life inspires you.
Which is why to day she tires of you, you'll be crying and howling.
And if you had the chance to go back to her pad for a passionate act you wont allow it.
But if your plans for a chance to go back ain't even had.
Then the passionate act won't happen, 'cause you plan not to have the chance,
Rewind back if that sounded fast.
Oi you can't think straight, you gotta avoid the situation ignore what she's doing.
You may be mugged if you trust too much but it will fuck you up more worrying about trust

If you never tell a lie to her,
You don't have to remember anything,

The Streets,"Using the following, I'm going to show you:

A) how to con someone using their own greed,
B) that you won't feel bad 'cos they're trying to con you anyway, and
C) taking their money!

As I have come to realize, running the beats is just getting people's confidence.

This scam only works 'cos that man thinks he's working this scam
And that you man off his mark
Get your mate, let's call your mate piers
No, not piers, let's call him Farquhar
Anyway get Farquhar to crawl into a bar with his dog
Like I said, the barman will try and con you later
But you're gonna take all his money.
Anyway, get Farquhar to pass into a local bar
And call to the bar to look after a dog for a dart
Just for twenty quid for a while, claiming that he hated it
But it was worth more than his car
This, by the way, requires that you find and supply Farquhar
With an animal, and a life, from your local park.
Get a nice dog that doesn't bark
But not so nice that someone might miss this mutt from the park

Anyway, using this technique you're gonna take all this man's money
But you're not gonna care, cos he's gonna fucking deserve it

[Chorus]
You'll never con an honest john
An honest john you can't drag down (exactly!)
Con-do-lee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one (it's all one big con)
Neighbor you won't con
An honest john

Now listen, get Farquhar to dart out the bar
And just shop for some garm's, maybe
Just to pass an hour or so
I would go shopping cos' I gave up drinking
But whatever, just have Farquhar down the road
Now you walk in the bar, walk up to the barman
Order a jar, when you've caught him slouched on his own
Start eying the dog that he's minding by his side
Currently vibe him and start on about the dog you own.
Start asking the barman, if it's his fine specimen of a dog
Nod, smile, agree, look interested and cool
When he tells you it's someone else's you've just left previous
Tell him, 'this is a very rare breed of animal.'
Last time I lied my manager swiped me
But lie, and tell him it's like a fucking red-eared hunting spaniel.
Tell him it's worth 600 quid and you would pay handsomely if you were to accept finance at all

[Chorus]
You'll never con an honest john (sometimes...)
An honest john you can't drag down (...sometimes I think I should just go completely...)
Condolee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one
Neighbor you won't con an honest john (keep listening though, it's important that you keep listening...)

Now take all his shopping off him
Get your mate Farquhar to pop in
Looking straight gutted a bit later on
He should order a jar, talk at the bar
Ensure he looks calm, warm with the barman
And generally start conversating on.
Farquhar should start falling apart
About how he's arsed up some chance
And how arsed up his day was.
Or in the event, the spread betting he's getting ready to accept
That his rent's not getting payed up.
The barman's mind will chime slowly for a while
He might wipe the bar, as his mind is making sums.
Farquhar should continue to moan about money
And that this mutt is not the greatest of his worries.
And like 'ching!', the barman will five out of six times
Kindly offer his greed to buy the dog for a price of three hundred quid
And after some bartering, your barman will haggle and charge harder
In greed of the scent of the scheme in his head. (that's right, neighbor!)

You'll never con an honest john
An honest john you can't drag down
Condolee get conned
When they think they're the cunning one
(the barman, is gonna see how much he can stitch you up for.)
Neighbor you won't con an honest john
(how does that work? cos' every time it's based around someone who thinks they're conning you.)

They'll never imagine the whole scenario is prepared solely for him
Why should he?
That sort of paranoia can get you in the loony bin!

As I have come to realize, running the beats is just getting people's confidence.
And than taking their money!

So I said I'd get my head down and I'd deal with the ache in my heart,
And for that if God exists I'd reckon he'd pay me regard,

I'm about to do something stupid

I dare say why my manager got lary and smacked me
These headaches are gettin' unbearably nasty
Staring at the crackwork, lookin' scary with me brandy
The rock 'n roll cliche walked in and then smacked me
Carelessly rackin' out prangs just to handle the fear
I do a line but then panic and feel a bit prang'd
So I glug Marlon from the bottle to ease of the panic
Then when it starts wearing off, I just feel a bit sad
Snort more tour support, and then have a drink
The bruise on the side of my head is madly banging
The only reason I started this was the deal me a laughin'

The girl in my bed is kinda distant right now,
I know shes thinkin' shes a bit frightened somehow,
I don't think she realized what I'd invited her back to my house
I don't want anyone to see me like this right now
I sorts thoughts rollin' back in my eyes
I've been a poor sports thoughts dance in my mind
A banging headache dancin' prang'd by their side
Dancin' with the pictures from the past of my life
I don't remember any of what I just thought at all
The conclusion prior to when I forgot it all
Panicing a bit, gettin' frightened 'n fuck all
So nursing my bruise I drink right from the bottle
I don't want anyone I know to see my like this
My fibs and single became lies and lists
She's gonna sell-tell no doubt fuck it
I'm not going to start drinkin', no, I can't for now

You're prangin' out

My laptop must have slipped down and gone to sleep
Before the prangers pain must've dawned on me
Stupid idiot!
Around the time I was skethchin' tryin' to con some sleep
And the new day on me was nearly dawning in here
I must have flaked while I puttied
Way to loads more
'Cuz I'd staked on bookings
Waited to tell the score
Why do I break my rules not to wager any more
I flaked on the bookings and majorly totaled on the score
I've got a simple problem
But my minds spinning out
I remembered the website between the wine and the stout
The rush of fear made me forget how fucked I'd been
This time I'm drying my eyes and a fuckin' nose bleed
Turnin' the phone off when my promo bloke phones me
Evaded for it got nasty when my manager when he only beat me
I threw his wallet out the window as it had grown heated
He said 'sort your life out' as he punched me onto my feet

You're prangin' out
I see through you
These voices talkin' to me

Right now logic states I need to be not contemplating suicide
'Cause rational thought it would seem that I need not to be doing stuff
That makes death seem like an easier option
I need a totally Trojan plan right now

Your task is to make her notice you fast but hanker when you don't close in after

When you're a famous boy, it gets really easy to get girls,
It's all so easy you get a bit spoiled.
So, when you try to pull a girl, who is also famous too,
It feels just like when you wasn't famous.

The celebrity pages in papers don't tell tales that are always to the line of the truth.
It's 'til a line at which most likely you'll have the time, or enough finance to sue.
Which is why it's so frightening buying papers in the morning fearing the next Mike Skinner scoop.
'Cause I used to believe what I read, so now I know that others will believe that it's true.

But I realized, with you the truth could be, a whole lot worse than the flack.
My whole life I never thought I'd see, a pop star smoke crack.
And I must admit I was quite shocked, with that thing you did with me on my back.
But, outside in the lobby, I shouldn't have laughed when you slapped that man.

Considering the amount of prang you'd done, you looked amazing on cd:uk.
You learn dances, do promo, cameras flashing, get in the van, zoom away (reeeoow).
I wake up high, diss my beat feel hung over and sorry for my doomed day.

But I know I got a bit close to you, and that you found it fucking boring.
You taught me so much about how to deal with the how far I'd fallin' in.
And what version of a rumor would next day be everyone's story of me.
You taught me all the realities and turn the page and ignore 'em.

Anyway, I had to rest my beer hat, delete my dealer's number and unroll my bank notes.
And we were on borrowed time anyway, what with the daily toilet papers not knowin'.
And I knew that when the people who thought they knew you, when they found out, 
I would've been mocked.
Which is ironic, 'cause in reality, standing next to you I look fucking soft.

Whenever I see you on MTV, I can't stop my big wide smile.

The points for right lying out and guides them good
They never really mimic every word by eye
'Cuz if they did they'd be in a whole world of strife
The book's quite old school, but then it was tough
It contains some quite experimental justice
The thinking people are thinking that without this book
That without these verses we'd pillage and murder but
Following this red book word for word
Leads you to actually pillage and murder
Could it be so what we think to be right,
Is simply the opinion that survived?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad
That's the religion I live by

There's a bloke in the book who made everything
He knows every individual and every trick in them
Way above emotion, never getting stressed
But when men choose against him, gets jealous
People fight for him in crippling wars
But since he has the power of infinite awe
We're merely itching on futilities floor
Should we really be needing to assist him at all?
If he loves us all, knowing all we think
Should he only like people with faith in him?
Given I can't control what I truly believe
Can I be forgiven for only believing who I see?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad
That's the religion I live by
Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cuz when you're bad you will feel sad

Could it be time to avoid this bush?
So we wouldn't be blind when joining up
Could we see both sides of the coin for the good?
Breed less strife on our voyage for good?
Getting threatened by men with questions
We'll never get anywhere rejecting evidence
Could we test everything instead of betting
On alleged legends?
If we teach that it's right to blindly believe
If we reach to the sky to define our meaning
Well I agree what's right will keep driving people to fight with people

I am in times that lie behind my eyelids

There's no rain on roof that grates and beats me
My favorite tree breaking lights to pieces
Sprinkling, shaded light on me
Throw a stone as high as you can
And hearing with hand not hear it land
Nothing taxing, dusting sand
My window and world spins and twirls
The walls then fall, I recall the sore
White clouds white wash faded spotless
The weighty shadows, ranges of rocks
The cold is all illusion thought up
The stroll on the shore, snooze and explore
All possibilities in each new morning
Until satisfied reaching out, yawning
Fish in a big dish, some rice and spice
Salt over shoulder never (?)
The truth I've told was silence sometimes
But who soul does not hide any crimes
Wrapped in walls, encircled by work
The walls fall - this story occurs
No barrier, no boundary, all hours I please
The freedom to stay all stray
Be fiend or friend, cause no harm but charm - the peaceful end

Little fleeting momentary me
I blink my eyes, this is reminding me
Life lies in the blink of an eye
The old die for reasons, new tide, four seasons
New life born is like changing
All these walls were really never there
Nor the ceiling or the chair
I am eking weeks of peace on a beach
I see the breezes weave the trees
I am not here at all

I see busheling trees, the shush at the sea

Fluttering seagulls

The Streets,"I'm really okay, thanks
There's nothing to witness
I said as I looked back from the edge of a cliff
The old man looking down bent over the ridge 
Struck with a grin as if a blessing had hit him

I slumped on the jut of the cliff
Just leave me alone, this is none of your business
I will, said the old man, but just one thing
And what he said was so lovely it stunned me

He said: I lay right there once at the edge of the rock
I was ready to jump, I was ever so lost
But this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot

[Chorus:]
For billions of years since the outset of time
Every single one of your ancestors has survived
Every single person on your mum and dad's side
Successfully looked after and passed on to you life
What are the chances of that, like?
It comes to me once in a while
And everywhere I tell folk it gets the best smile

And then the old man walked away and out of sight
Til the sound of him hiking turned to the sound of silence.
I just froze in a profound surprise 
And from down on my pride I found a smile to my eyes.

And for many days again I've been passing the same cliff 
And on many occasions I'd chance on the same thing

Laying in the moss, in the same way I was 
Would be another man looking like he needed a change of luck

So I'd say: I lay right there once at the edge of the rock
I was ready to jump, I was ever so lost
But this gentleman stopped and said something I never forgot

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]",On the Edge of a Cliff
The Streets,"From the point he gazed from the choice was made, but 'walk the cave or the shore?'
The oily cave seemed to breathe on him through gravestone jaws
His little hand grasped in anguish as he weighed up his coin
Somewhere a blue-eyed girl in the world is just waiting for a boy
Footprints trailed as if trod by slaves up to the grey cave floor
But not one graze from anything ever escaping this fort
So with coin on hand his joy came back when ordered to take the shore
'Why on earth', as he wandered the warmth, 'am I obeying this coin?'

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

Again, walk within the trusted beach or swim the swell of the sea?
And again the scarier alternative looked like certain death to he
He'd never learnt to skill of swimming - it never occurred to be very easy
And again he winced as he flipped the coin and it twirled to his feet
'How is this sane?' he blamed the coin now aiming for the waves
As he hesitated at the swirl of water as it raged and rained
Blue-eyed girls were waiting and he was drowning in the spray
Blue-eyed girls he should have been acquainted with but for shouting and flailing

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says

He finally slugs it back to land feeling chewed-up and foolish
Empties his pockets on the sand spewing a pool each
Staggers back to his dad who's too cool to be
So he says 'why did you have me follow this stupid rule, please?'
To be honest little fellow I'll tell you
I was just as afraid as you
But you said you wanted to get with people and places ever new
And I got a bit scared of the fate of my baby son's future
So I invented a reason to see if you could ever make do
As soon as you appeared behind that rock looking angry at me
I soon realized what a hell of a man you've ended up being
I knew you'd worked out how to swim, which I hadn't had in me
And I stand as a companion of you, proudest a man has ever been

Turn your life on the flip of this coin
Turn upside a choice you'd normally avoid
And promise me you'll follow what it says
Whatever it says",On the Flip of a Coin

It's not for others in ear splash

The word which we will laugh at
It sparks around the crowd this work of art which we have found

And girls all love the lingo

They go that extra smile
And they go that whole damn smock
I mean it though a joke from that one like that one was wrong
It makes no sense really
Shorten to a word and then to a nod

The secret handshake of three mad mates
It makes me pleased to share traits
In understanding absurdities that mean our brains play

Is that you verse your views quietly
When nature verses truths I get violent feelings

But met with a cute blind snide of fear

At a party for my parting in a bar

It's a pity they don't know me but what is there else than this?

Sweeping and sweeping, the speaking unceasing
From steeple to steeple, the people are shrieking
Soon we parade through the fence, absolutely Dame Judy Dench'd
And then stop, tell them to score and they flop

I don't think I like this, I'm only ever nervous
I'm a fighter, I'm a fighter but tonight I'd like to flight
Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, wait
Any day, any day

Ask me to show you, ask me to go

I see Alice in Wonderland
I see malice in Sunderland

Shake Bacardi's and Coke and make me laugh and

The future is not evil
The future is not fish and it's simple, it's efficient
Now that things are costing nothing
Is any of it good?

Blogging river floods
Dead plant planted on the window ledge
Shadows dance, glint and blend
Glance slow at the night outside

Sound rumbles in 5.1 round some corner to fight with guns
Play God in games but nothing in

The Streets,"I used to love the night and now I dread my bed
Using all the light is how my head got spent
Torturous virus talk to my eyelids, walk in my size nines
Is this depression or a lesson from inner pressure pressing?
Either way, the fevers it deals me are evil

The thing that I love most is trying to kill M.E.

I have the queerest feeling of my dearest appearing
To be leering from the ether, fear more fever
I don't like sleepers, drugs make me sleep
Sleep is like death, to do death when you're dead

Bridge disappears through fog in my ears
For this chronic fatigue, there's no tonic is seems
Lucid thinking is loopy to think of on and on weeks

The thing that I love most is trying to kill M.E.

General health making my mental health break
But I'll never let go of what helps me create
Nothing to this point but for this love
Love, torturous virus get out from my eyelids

Just wanna ride out life in the key of C
I won't bash the black notes, I won't ask for answers
Glance up at the banister

The thing that I love most is trying to kill M.E.

The only good thing and I should cling to it good
Are the sparks of good art that park in the darkness
Shaking eyes hate me to write
But make me think up quite nice ideas

It's like me enemy, telling me forget the pen dwelling
The madness and sadness is long
But flashes of mastery

It seems

How many ways will it warm up, 8 months ago fate came
To break me in somewhat and rape me on the flames
The queerest feeling of my dearest appearing
To be leering from the ether, I fear more fever

Like the bridge disappearing through fog in my ears
There's no tonic it seems for this chronic fatigue
I'm happily trading insanity lately
For passion, that makes me a man at least, maybe

The Streets,"Some people live their lives by a little red book
The points for right lying out and guides them good
They never really mimic every word by eye
'Cause if they did they'd be in a whole world of strife
The book's quite old school, but then it was tough
It contains some quite experimental justice
The thinking people are thinking that without this book
That without these verses we'd pillage and murder but,
Following this red book word for word
Leads you to actually pillage and murder
Could it be so what we think to be right,
Is simply the opinion that survived?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cause when you're bad you will feel sad
That's the religion I live by

There's a bloke in the book who made everything
He knows every individual and every trick in them
Way above emotion, never getting stressed
But when men choose against him, gets jealous
People fight for him in crippling wars
But since he has the power of infinite awe
We're merely itching on futilities floor
Should we really be needing to assist him at all?
If he loves us all, knowing all we think
Should he only like people with faith in him?
Given I can't control what I truly believe,
Can I be forgiven for only believing who I see?

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cause when you're bad you will feel sad
That's the religion I live by
Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright

Could it be time to avoid this bush?
So we wouldn't be blind when joining up coulds
Could we see both sides of the coin for the good?
Breed less strife on our voyage for good?
Getting threatened by men with questions
We'll never get anywhere rejecting evidence
Could we test everything instead of betting,
On alleged legends?
If we teach that it's right to blindly believe
If we reach to the sky to define our meaning
Well I agree what's right will keep driving people to fight with people

Do what you think's right, and you will feel alright
'Cause when you're bad you will feel sad

With a cabinet full of mushrooms

The peaks were white, the sky was blue
And the sun was beatin down
We were rolling down the highway

So, I pulled into a liquor store
That's where the trouble all began
Cause I ran into their awning
And had a run-in with the man

Cause I don't want to be stuck in jail
When the sun goes down
You can't bust me, cause you don't know what you found.

I even offered her some cash
But she wouldn't listen she was callin the cops
Because her gutter had been smashed
Next thing I knew when I walked outside
There were police all around
Askin who was the driver of the vehicle?
Can I see your license Whatca doin in our town?

We were sitting on the steps of the liquor store 
Trying not to look too scared

But they didn't know what it was and let us go

The String Cheese Incident,"Ever been lost?
Ever felt completely alone?
Feel like your sleeping?
What are you dreaming of?
You see a mirror
Casting reflections of me and you
What do you see?
Something that's pure and true?
Dreamed you're an angel
Attempting to find a way
Feel I could stay here
See the dream unfold as it may
Sometimes I feel
That there's no where to run and hide
Look again and wonder why
See all my fears come up inside
And then I feel
Then I feel

Can you hear the song she sings?

Do you feel the joy it brings?
You'll want to tell her
Tell her how you feel
Make time to thank her
Only you can make it real
Feel like I've known you
Many times before
You were a muse and I was the Shepard
Looking for more to explore
Look to the heavens
See what I could find
Its alright I got some arrows
I only hope you're here tomorrow
So I could feel
So I could feel

Looking around for some direction

Think I could find the key to these city dreams

Took a drag
From a smoke that may kill me

The String Cheese Incident,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom

Take a shit, it was fine

Everybody's so inviting

It's not that I don't really love you
It's just that I don't really know
The hateful things you think you want to say
Time will turn them into jokes

Yes it was all just a dream, Oh no
Was it real? I don't know (I hope so )
If it was you were all there with me

They go fast like a sun that's been shot

Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what they wear
'Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care

This whole life is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up, then I waved then I fell
I recall you were all there with me
Overjoyed and at peace

Third time's the charm
