Notes: the fall cover

[thurston]
Turn on the straight
Turn up to game
And now it comes
And when it's done
I found my love
And the psycho mafia
I found my love
And the psycho mafia

Not much is done
No magic wand
So what's your problem
Have we taken yours
I found my love
And the psycho mafia
I found my love
And the psycho mafia
Psycho psycho mafia
Psycho psycho mafia
'cho mafia
'cho mafia

But I'm straight
That ain't game
But like the rest
I'm afraid of the jet
But I'm a carper
Psycho mafia
I'm talking about love
And psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia
Psycho mafia

Sonic Youth,"Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you want to go, get on below
Pinking out the day, dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love, it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on, hi di ho
Pinking out the black, dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue, now it's undone

I got some dirty boots, yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots

Hey!",Dirty Boots
Sonic Youth,"Here it comes again, out of the rain
Seems to have a new, kind of same
Been it playing on a, simple rhyme
The site comes alive and, speaks the mind
It turns to me and, it turns to gold
It turns to see, the fast lane slow

It's been a way too long
It's been the way I'm goin'
It's a-coasting on
To the west star

Looking out I thought I, saw it blink
Coming on to me, like a silver eye
Pick it up and, turn it on and
Head on out to a, western starland

It's been a man and gone 
Now it's a singing song
Like a western star
It's going my way

Looking out I'm back in, time to stay
Into the eastern, silent way 
It comes alive, through the clearer
A ghost arise to, a mirror

You've been away too long 
It's been way too long
An eastern star is on
A disappearer",Disappearer

Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a chance here
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so

Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't want to, I don't think so
I don't want to, I don't think so

Yeah, tell'em about it,
Hit'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here, sit down
There's something I go to ask you.
I just want to know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is!
Huh?
Yeah!
Don't be shy
Word up!
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby!
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Come on, come on, come on, come on let everybody know

When you're a star, I know you'll fix everything
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master

I don't want to, I don't think so

Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer

Sonic Youth,"When you see the spiral turning through alone
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it
When the sea of madness turns you into stone
Picture of your life shoots like a rocket
All the time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you
From nowhere, to nowhere
Cut together, cut through

I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye
And I can't see you breathing as before
I am airless, a vacuum child
And I can't stand to reason at your door
In this time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through yo
From nowhere, to nowhere
Come together

I'm down in the daytime out of sight
Comin' in from dreamland I'm on fire
I can see it's all been here before
Dream a dream that lies right at your door

When the seasons circle sideways out of turn
And words don't speak just fall across the carpet
You're just in time to watch the fire burn
It seems a crime but your face is bright you love it
All the time",Mote
Sonic Youth,"My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care
What she does best is stand and stare

She can play the drums set too
And the boys say, ""hey Goo what's new?""
My friend Goo just says, ""Hey you""
My friend Goo just says, ""Hey you""

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down most anywhere

She doesn't have nothing to do
And the boys say, ""hey Goo what's new?""
My friend Goo goes, ""Hey you""

Sonic Youth,"Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey what are you waiting for, feeding, feeding me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror, I'm bigger in every way

She said,
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

I'm in heaven now, I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye Downey, hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end

Dreaming, dreaming of how it's supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning, around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing, I'm bigger in every way

She said,
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Hey mom! Look I'm up here, I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad, the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said honey, you look so under-fed

Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes, and I'm bigger in every way

She said,
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Goodbye Richard, gotta go now
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing, little girl's got the blues

I would give you a kick

She's polishing her fist

If you could give me anything
Would you consider a fist?
Don't give me yourr soul
It's caught in this abyss

Fresh from the wonderlust

Cinderella is a kiss

A cold is gonna take you
And freeze away your tears
Hold me closer honey
You can be so near

Mind your heart aside you 
Really got no sense of time 
Ninety-nine inside you
That I'm scared if you were cryin'

If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick

I think... but I might be wrong
this goes to to the attic and buzz on the wall

and that's all I know right now
that's all
that's all
I know, right now

it's dark outside except for pinpoint light
lost in a fight
picking up from the street
I'll stop over once and lay it at your feet
`cause I'm yours and you're mine
that's all I know right now
that's all
that's all
I know, right now

oh, baby it's dark out there
but oh, baby it's dark in here
oh, darling I don't care no no

my TV's up against the wall like a painting
abstaining
but I myself had a thought for my lips
it's delicious lady won't you have a sip
`cause I'm yours and you're mine
and that's all I know right now
that's all

Sonic Youth,"(Hatred)
(I hate the past)

I can't see anything at all, all I see is me
That's clear enough
And that's what's important, to see me

My eyes can focus
My brain is talking
It looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
It looks pretty good to me

Sometimes I speak
Tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak
And laugh all day

Hold these pages up to the light
See the jackknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep-freeze

Mary, a simple word, are you there in the cold country?
Your eyes so full, your head so tight
Can't you hear me?
Remember our talk that day on the phone?
I said I was the door, and you were the station
With shattered glass and miles between us
We still flew away in the conversation

My cup is full, and I feel okay
The world is dull, but not today

She think's she's a goddess
She says she talks to the spirits
I wonder if she can talk to herself?
If she can bear to hear it?

This is Eric's trip
We've all come to watch him slip
He's slipping all the way to Texas
Can you dig it?

I see with a glass eye
The pavement view
A shadow forming, across the fields rushing
Through me to you

We tore down the world, and put up four walls
I breathe in the myth
I'm over the city, fucking the future
I'm high and inside your kiss

We can't see clear
But what we see is alright
We make up what we can't hear
And then we sing all night

Scattered pages and shattered lights
See the jackknife, see the dream
There's something moving over there to the right
Like nothing I've never seen",Eric's Trip [Live]

Turning room and that's a show

Like a crown with all jewels

The wind is busy blowing dizzy

Exploding in a mind somewhere
Doing something on a dare
Pulling a trigger like breathing air

To what he'd made while others saved

Dead middle of night
There was nothing on the line
I set back the silent receiver
Tiny flames lit in my head
Hey did any of you freaks here ever remember Lenny?
I can't remember his last name
He's turned to dust now, one of the chosen few
Left out in the rain, out of town again
Left out in the rain, ocean bound I guess

Between the mattress
And a column of hazy faces
I remember every word you said
Quite a clear picture: every word you said
The door was open but the way was not lit
And there was no way out of my head

On a crimson highway by a chrome bumper
I last saw you alive, inclined to thrive
Evening fireflies lit sparks around your head
But wait a minute, let's back up a bit
Some famous stars were busted
Down on fashion avenue
Impersonating real men
Not knowing who they really were

Now here at dark corners all is calm and quiet
And good
The kids are up late dreaming quiet questions
In a graceful mood
Can you please pass me a jug of winter light?
Fold me in an ocean's whim?
In sweet corrosive fire light?
In the city made of tin?
Are you famous under the skin?
Familiar with the things you wanted?
Able now to take it all in?
Making peace with every hole in the story?

Did lightning keep you up all night?
Illuminate the soot and grit?
Can you tell how high the sky tonight?
Dig out from under in spite of it?
Can you cover up the one that floats?
Push back the hours?

You gave it, You gave it all
Oh, yes You did, You gave it all

I will give my heart to You
I will, I will
Broken and poured out for You
I will, I will

No price I pay
Will ever be too great for me
To rest alone in the love You've shown
I'm free, I'm free

You took the stripes
You took the pain for me
So now I sing a song of hope
I'm free, I'm free

So now I sing Hallelujah

Sonnee West,"Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you 
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
",Wasted Days and Wasted Nights
Sonny,"Now I've got it all planned out,
how I'm going to win you back.
First- I'll drive 2 days to see you 
Second- Show up to your door w/ roses behind my back.
Third- I'll say how much I can't live without you,
‚ÄúYou know I can't live without you‚Äù.

Breathe in the cold air,
it smells like every winter night we spent in the snow. 
Maybe I'm just a little crazy, but...
nobody's perfect.
And every night I want to see fireworks with you,
but even in my dreams 
I know this can't come true.

Though here I am at your doorstep.
‚ÄúWon't you ask me to come inside?‚Äù
It's been 11 months since we sat on your couch... together.
And you never knew how much 
I wanted my hand on your knee.
Now please tell me how we feel so far apart.

Can I fix it now? 

This cold leather couch could be our starting ground 
and the truth will be told.
So tonight the light on the street won't be mine.",It's Never Too Late
Sonny,"We grabbed a piece of driftwood 
Hold on tight and please don't let go

We'll follow the waves to the nearest shoreline
Wake up to the coast of some distant island in the South Pacific
Leave behind everything we once had
A brand new start with no one to tell us what to do
Tomorrow will tell us that we can make it too
And if that doesn't work you say
We'll flip a quarter and find a new place to go
Heads Kansas City, tails California

Never again stay within the boundaries of this town
Step outside the barrier
And I don't want to be the follower anymore
So take this string from out my back and let my feet be free again
I might stumble when I walk but at least I am on my own
And I won't say that it's the last time... 
It's the last time",Through the Looking Glass
Sonny,"2 A.M. in the morning
All I can think of is
Who is where is she
Yeah
Why wasn't I on her
It didn't occur to me
My dream girl was her
In my sleep I wonder
Maybe if I

Wen't hard and got her down
Our hearts be knocking
Like we hit the club
Our music rocking
I wanna get her now
Won't sleep till I get her out
Take her out my dream tonight

No more lonely nights again
Just you again
No nights again
Without you again
I wanna visualize
Gotta get my vision right
Take her out my dream tonight

I just need love

I just need love

I just need love

8 P.M. in the evening
Still haven't heard back from ya
I tried to call ya
But you didn't answer no
Here I go with my conscience
Why you gotta be bad for me to be so under
She making me want her so bad
Now I gotta

When she coming out there
Wanna get a little bit of

Wanna see how good her love is

Sonny & Cher,"What's your name is it Jane
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?
It's just I tired of wasting my hours
Talking to trees and watching flowers grow
Watching birds chasing bees
Little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?

[Chorus]
Don't misunderstand me
I'm just an old man with no place to go
And if you oblige me and sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story a beautiful story
That you might not know Please don't go

Pardon me mister tree
I hope I didn't offend you before
You are my friend but I wanted much more
But now I'm back once again
Like always before
Watching birds chasing bees
Little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?

[Chorus]",Beautiful Story
Sonny & Cher,"When people say, you're not my kind
And that your clothes are out of line
And that your hair isn't combed all the time
You're not real pretty but you're mine

We have a great big old society
That won't make room for folks
Like you and me
But I got some real sad news
For them my friend
They're on the outside looking in

We've got a great thing going
And it's gonna keep right on growing
And I hope that soon they'll see the light
But until that time
They'll have to blow their mind
Cause it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight
So when we're walking I don't care
When all those people stop and stare
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see
You're not real pretty but you belong to me

Hey hey hey now
Hey hey hey now
When you're lovin' me baby
And when I hold you baby
(When you kiss you)
I know you love me baby
(When I hold you)
You know I'll never leave you
(When I touch you)
I know I'll always love you
(Every day now)
You know I love you baby
You know I love you baby",But You're Mine
Sonny & Cher,"It's gonna rain outside
I can tell by the clouds
In the sky whoa, whoa
Uh-uh oh uh-uh

You used to come
And see me baby all the time
People see you walking down the street
They say you were mine
We use to love each other baby
Ah that's all
Well I can still remember
Your skin so soft

It's gonna rain outside
I can tell by the clouds
In the sky whoa, whoa
Uh-uh oh uh-uh

You would come and see me
Baby gave you all I had to give
Sometimes when you left me
I didn't know if I was gonna live
Used to watch the suns come up
And the moons go down
We used to take off our shoes
And stamp our feet in the ground
Oh yeah",It's Gonna Rain
Sonny & Cher,"You're not the kind of guy
That make the girls all sigh
And they never turn their heads
And look when you walk by

But baby that's okay I love you anyway
And I never change or rearrange you
So stay that way

Cause it's the little things that mean a lot
It's what you are not what you got
Call my name and I'll come running
Look at me and the clouds start sunning
Hold my hand and you got me going
Kiss my lips and my mind starts going
We got a thing that won't stop cooking
You turn me on just by looking
You can make me strong just by sighing
You can break my heart just by crying

You're not the smartest man that I ever met
And every word you ever said I won't forget
And so I guess that's why until the day I die
When you're bad and make me sad
You're still my guy",It's the Little Things
Sonny & Cher,"With his big brown eyes he came my way
I didn't know then what he had to say
I could tell that he felt bad
By the way he looked that he felt sad, oh yeah

Sometimes you hurt me baby, I don't know why
I'll always love you baby till the day I die
But when you look at fellas
Baby I get jealous
I only live my life for you
Anything you say I'll do
I'll live for you, I'll die for you
I'll even climb the mountains high for you

Thought right then he'd break my heart
I could feel the teardrops start
Why didn't he know I love him so
I could never let him go, oh no

I'd never hurt you baby, tell you why
I'm gonna love you till the day I die
When I look at fellas
Baby don't get jealous
I only live my life for you, anything you say I'll do
I'll live for you, I'll die for you

Why do they try and make me run
Son of a gun
Now what do they care
About the clothes I wear
Why get their kicks from making fun
Yeah this world's got a lot of space
And if they don't like my face
It ain't me that's going any where, no

So I don't care
Then laugh at me
If that's fair
I have to beg to be free
Then baby laugh at me
And I'll cry for you
And I'll pray for you
And I'll do all the things
That the man up stairs says to do
I'll do them for you
I'll do them
I'll do them all for you

It's gotta start some place
It's gotta start some how
I'll make that other cheek mine
And maybe the next guy
That don't wear a silk tie
And he can walk by and say hi
Say hi, instead of why
Instead of why
Instead of why, baby
Instead of why
What did I do to you",Laugh at Me

Then I know I don't have to hide from anyone

Come catch my hand I'm near you
Little girl you're singin'
Come close to me I hear you
You're growin' old, my mother's cold
Now you've learned what it meant to be mature
There's no such place as make believe
But when I look at your face, 
I'm not so sure

You and me is what I see
And that's the way its gonna stay and it will always be

You're all I see

Sitting up on a throne
I had lots of guys
But no one I wanted to call my own
Deep down inside
I felt the same as you
Wondering to wondering to

Wondering if it happens
Like it happens to millions before
I took one look at your face
I wanted to see it some more
And I tried playing it cool
Like a silly fool
Wondering what to do

Baby I knew that
I couldn't live without you
I ran right home
And I wrote a song all about you
Nothing like this
Had ever happened to me before
I was afraid but I knew
I had to see you once more

I walk the night without a goal

Here come the stars tumbling around me

Sonny & Cher,"Hi, this is Sonny

And Cher

And this is the other side of our record
When you cut a record
Every one always asks you
What you are gonna put on the other side
And you usually put another song
Sometimes it's hard to get another song
Or to think of another song
And I thought it would be nice
Just to get a chance to talk to you
And say thank you
For everything you've done for us
I don't see why this can't be done
I hope you agree
What do you think Cher?

That's OK with me

It's OK with you
It's OK with me too

I think you should put the music down
Before the words down

What music?

To this song

There is no song

No, really

Really what?
There is no song
I'm just plinking on the piano
I only know seven chords any ways
So it doesn't make any difference
What do you mean
We should put the music first

I'm not gonna say anything to you
Come on Sonny

You're not gonna say anything, why?

Because you're making me embarrassed

Don't be embrassed
You're just talking to a microphone
And that's all
You have nothing to say at all

No

I didn't know you were bashful
When you get up on stage
You're not bashful
Now you're talking to a microphone
You're in a studio all by yourself
And you're bashful
You don't like this song?

No, I don't like this song

I'll try to write you a new one
I like it, I think
Well Cher you got to say something
Cher don't be bashful

I can't think of any thing to say

You always think of something
To say around the house
You never without words then

I can't help it, I'm bashful

OK I glad I found that out
After two years of marriage

Well I can sing some thing

I don't have a song for you to sing
Well just say something

Hello

That was very clever

I thought you'd like that

That's the most original thing you said
Any ways we thought
We break a precedent
And just say hello to every body
And that's the purpose behind this
And thanks again

And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice and
So I said I might take a chance

When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shinning bright
And then he kissed me-Then I kissed her

Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered I love you
I said that I love him too
And then he kissed me-Then I kissed her

He kissed me in a way
That I never been kissed before
He kissed me in a way
That I want to be kiss forever more
I knew she was mine
So I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day I took her home
To meet my mom and my dad
Then he ask me to be his bride

Sonny & Cher,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far

It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You

As you took off my ring
Then you gently put it in my hand

So you put the ring in your pocket
I slowly turned to walk out the door
You were so much stronger
Than you've ever been before

You put on the greatest show on earth
It was the greatest show on earth
But then I stopped dead in my tracks
And begged you to take me back

The next time that I saw you
You were waiting for a bus
I just happened to be passing by
When I said hello and every little thing
You said you'd be married and you lied

I guess you know that I've been keeping busy
I've been going out most every night
You were very happy
That my future looked so bright

[Chorus]

Yesterday I called to see
If we could meet somewhere
I've been thinking about you for some time
But soon as I walked in that place
Where we used to go
You knew just what I had on my mind

You thought it could be just like old times
Honey it could never be the same
I got up from the table walked away
While you remained

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",The Greatest Show on Earth [Album Version]

Her name is, Miss Kate

You fool with too many men

Sonny Burgess,"I never thought I'd say it
But I can't take anymore
We both work so hard that I forgot
Just what it was that we've been working for

This daily grind has wore us down
Where we hardly even talk when we come home
Girl, I think it would be best for us
If I had some time alone

Alone with you, together in love
Where we can't be reached while we get back in touch
Darlin', let's pull the shades and kill the lights in this room
I need some time alone, alone with you

I could go stay at my brother's and ask him
Why he thinks we've grown apart
Then come back in a week or two
And try to make a brand new start

Or I could belly-up to Shady's bar
And tell 'em all just where we went wrong
But I think we'd be better off
If I just spent some time alone

Alone with you, together in love
Where we can't be reached while we get back in touch
Darlin', let's pull the shades and kill the lights in this room
I need some time alone, alone with you

Darlin', let's pull the shades and kill the lights in this room

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind

I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Sonny Criss,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?

Sonny Dunham,"It was a most romantic interlude
And we were in a most romantic mood
Our hearts were lost in reverie
I only knew you were close to me
 
The music stopped, but we were still dancing
Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms
The band had left the stand and we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud 'way off in the blue
The music stopped and people were glancing
But we went on dancin' for we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Sonny Greenwich,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

And no one cares at all or seems to worry about that once upon a time
When love was kind
Sometimes in our lives it's good to know
That there's a place to go and hide those tears

They tell the story of a lost and broken love
And golden dreams of life that disappear
Each one of us can go to Woodbine Valley where ever true love goes astray
Your dreams will start to grow releasing old mem'ries
Lonely hearts will learn there is a day love comes to stay",Woodbine Valley
Sonny James,"Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone.
Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low,
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Sonny James,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
",Whoever Finds This I Love You
Sonny James,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out

All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do

Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door and my secret love's no secret anymore

Now I shout it...",Secret Love

For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing

An airline ticket to romantic places

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Lovely, never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight.

My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Sonny Sharrock,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

Sonny Stitt,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall

And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Sonny Stitt,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Sonny Stitt,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat

Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away

You are mine alone.

Sonny Stitt,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?

About old lost John
Lost John was a boy that got loose
From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him
Sheriffs, deputies
And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

Lost John outrun the bloodhounds there
All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

So la donna che sei

Mi fermo, ti guardo, poi s'vengo
Mi prendi, mi spolpi, mi arrendo
Carezze pesanti sui fianchi
Fai di me cio che sai tu

Tu si, tu si, tu sei
La bellezza che mi siede
Sei la donna che vuoi
Ogni volta che sei
Tu si, tu si, tu sei
La bellezza che mi uccide
Sei la donna che vuoi

Sonohra,"Vento e sabbia,
Brucia il sole sulle labbra
Solo polvere di strada senza lei.
Canto dentro la mia rabbia nel silenzio.
Uno sbaglio che a ogni passo rifarei.
Vago cos√¨ cercandoti,
Dimenticandoti.

Chorus:
Sono io che non ho
Una vita uguale a te,
Cambio in corsa direzione perch√©
Sono il cowboy,
Non so stare dove stai
Ho dei sogni che non se ti direi
Sei uguale a me.

L'orizzonte √® un linea sulle mani
La mia anima √® a un passo dietro me
Scorre il cielo,
Il deserto mi fa uomo
Stelle grandi come gli occhi suoi di lei.
Vago cos√¨ spegnendoti,
Dimenticandoti.

Chorus:
Sono io che non ho
Una vita uguale a te,
Cambio in corsa direzione perch√©
Sono io il cowboy,

Sonoko,"She cries, ""It's freedom that we need""
But I have yet to see a cause to believe
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)
It comes in waves of need
Ten ways to make you bleed before you get to die

Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims

Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free
He sighs, ""I'm quickly burning out""
All that's left of me are jaded memories
(I need to feel it, please just let me feel alright)

Of what I could have been
If I had only been less of what they wanted
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful
Just to make it through?

This is not a requiem we're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives on bended knee
Choosing not to be free and we're still here
All together and alone consumed with fear
That one day we'll discover how empty we've become

Sickened and ashamed
We crave what they provide us
So we'll never feel alone
Can we give it one more shot?
Have we thrown all hope away?
Does it have to be this painful

Just to make it through?
This is not a requiem
We're wasting time as victims
Why spend our lives 
On bended knee

Sino no lo recuerdas, tu vida era mia
Es que vivir sin tu presencia es querer
Esperar bajo en agua, si tu no estas conmigo

Sons and Daughters,"With the same eyes as me
The same fearing frame
We can try and disguise
Compromise rights
And I know what you're thinking
We wear the same dress
The same colours right
Is this what suits our weakened pride?
How do I know 'cause you're my blood

With the kinks and wires like me
The same fearing frame
We can run and hide
See the signs
Call to no-one
Taste with the same tongue
Swelling up inside
We can speak and re-sign

The case was wide open
I see a heart on her shoulder
With his first name written

And what do lately
Consider to be yourself?
With your outsize hands
Your molten breath

October is the month
We'll pray for the summer
When trees are branching
A long distant murmur

And what do lately

Oh Oh why
You can look inside

Your looking now
One comes one comes
To find us out

I know many have tried
Not a blind man among you
For years let fate decide
So swallowed and followed and played through start to end
With the good weight all carried by your faithful friend

She wrote you a song and you bought a wedding dress
Having handsome bite buxom
Have insured people met
Then sundry and nocturnal
You lay your peace to sleep
With your new loves good fortunes
And secrets safe to keep

In a hopeless silence that falls between our eyes

Go

And can you be clear to what you adhere to? 

Find a false witness in somebody near you 
One of us is right 
None of this is right
I'll cut you out of every photograph within an inch of your life

When it's just another fear to fry within this sacred fold 
I am innocent 
The sweat pours in like an ancient grin and laughs like a suffering one 
It's colder now as my mouth runs out 
How many times are we taken over? 
I am innocent
There's one of us in the middle and there's two now on the end

Your asleep in the next room and I'm banging to be found

It's a ride 
Help me help me help me it's a bitter hit to take 
When I'm shaking once again this is too long to be awake
With the ignorance of new year 

You could save me for your sake
Because I'm falling through the plans that we made 
It's a ride 
My medicine

Happy happy happy you can lie behind the eyes
Without telling those around you that you've built your own disguise
Now time can only end it when the remedy's not found 
Just wrap it up and never take it out

What have we started? 
Maybe I call you a liar

Take me down and then a a a a a 
Don't go and ask your sick little questions
I can't find the cure for desire
If this continues

I'm saving myself 
By putting my hands in the fire 
What's natural and real 
Like monsters we 

Like banshees 
That's what we've become 
There's half a discussion and then we ask 
What kind of love we have

In early October 
His wavy brown hair 
Stuck wet to his shoulder

Go the heels of his feet

How long has it been since the boyfriend has visited 

The milk's in a pile by the door 
Her series is playing on terrestrial T.V. the neighbours they don't even know 
And its click, click, click 
Go the heels of his feet 

Listen 
Did you hang her out to dry?
The meal that she was going to eat for her dinner 
Is left on a plate by the stove 

While there's unopened bills and letters and junk mail
All strewn on the mat by the door 
And its click, click click 
Go the heels of his feet

While she's face down on porcelain
An inchful of bathwater

Goes the tap on her ankles

Sons and Daughters,"Phone phone the red receiver at the end of the bed it keeps getting clearer 
Rings run running around me 
Untying the ribbons for the good of the family 
And your dear friends gathered together 
You were looking for trouble now your losing your temper
Cold feet in London 
Useless confetti 
No groom 
No first kiss

No diamonds for the girl
Don't look in the side of the wardrobe
The white dress hangs tall as a tightrope
Clothes piled high in a suitcase
Better get moving fast for it's too late

Formed a search and followed their partners

What it takes to make a show
'Cause who wants to be ignored?

Six, seven, eight, nine
Nobody home, ran out of time

Never beat me, please believe me
There's a river running through me
I don't need no reason or a changing season
Out of the rain and the chain, chain, chains

Drag myself up to bring you down and you said
Too much tragedy in this woman
Cannot help but be impressed
By your logic and your state of interest

I'll give you one, two, three, four, five
If you know what's good you'd better look alive

Nowhere to run so hide, hide, hide

Never beat me, please believe me
There's a river running through me
I don't need no reason or a changing season
Out of the rain and the chain, chain, chains

Gotta laugh on back at love
Gotta laugh on back at love
A river's too much to love
Jump out before it floods

A solitary bird, high tension line
Dreaming of a pure white sky
Did somebody stop the time?

Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride

Used to burn, now no fire of life
Settle for the riches to be fed
Deliver to the valley of the bed

You'd take me with you, I think we earned it

No stop signs

No red lights

You left me stationed on the chair by the phone
No ticket out or a thread of hope
(Too late)
At the traffic lights
(Too late)
For this trust of mine

There's no sadder sight to see
Trains in the distance as you leave
There's no sadder sight to see
Say goodbye to five-fourteen

Said that you'd call, scream when you're leaving
At least I'm hurting so you sparked some feeling
(Too late)
At the traffic lights
(Too late)
Should have seen the signs

Sometimes I see you by your bedroom window
Hallucination, a single shadow
(Too late)
No stop signs
(Too late)
For a heart like mine

There's no sadder sight to see
Trains in the distance as you leave
There's no sadder sight to see
Say goodbye to five-fourteen

Cannot happen when you're dead, she safely said
Worry when you wake tonight
Is it all in your head?

So you want to run, deny
No time to sit and rest or re-address
All that comes to you
When you're picturing the nest

And he never understands, that the photo in the drawer
Is all you're looking for
Blue to gray, then back again
Watch the fading paper wall

Scratching at the window glass
Trees along the ledge, are they in your head?
Creepers beat, beat, beat tonight
Picturing the nest

The sight at sixteen
Of the son she never had
Once she had a dream
Of the ones she'll never have

Your ending, your ending
Your ending, your ending

You're only half a person now
So fold over what is left to be addressed
What you want when you wake tonight
Is it all in your head?

So you turn over, lie
Cradling this perfect mess, this home-made dress
You've seen what comes to those
Who put a picture in the nest

The sight at sixteen
Of the one she'll never have
Once she had a dream
Of the son she'll never have

Your ending, your ending

Rattling along the corridor
Wearing my name around my neck
I'd long forgotten who I was

So I rebel with the ghost
Try to fight but my hands and feet are fading
Used to fall for it all
Now my weak insides are backed by gutless conversation

A specter of your former self
No reflection in the mirror, when you least expect
Wearing my name around my neck
Apparently just self-possessed

So I rebel with the ghost
Try to fight but my hands and feet are fading
Holding on to the wall
Now my weak insides are backed by gutless conversation

I rebel with the ghost
Try to fight but my hands and feet are fading
Used to fall for it all

Sons and Daughters,"Don't know the meaning of devotional
Pictured me hanging threadbare on the blacked out wall
Purposeful, in your weekly disguise
Surrendering to arms, fixing up those seeded eyes
Dress it up, down the alcohol, feeling so much better

Cross me, collecting, this scene is all wrong
Curtailing ourselves, nothing lasts so very long
A carbon copy that typed out wrong
Ghost in a black coat sliding slowly along
Dressed up, down the alcohol, feeling so much better

This gift, open wide, crawling walls
He's got this gift, ten stories tall
This gift, open wide, crawling walls
He's got this gift, ten stories tall

Don't know the meaning of devotional
Pictured me there threadbare on the bathroom floor
Purposeful, your secret disguise
Surrender to his arms, fixing up those seeded eyes
So you sing happy birthday to death, a hater's wealth and a lover's rest

Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend

Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection

A clash of religions, as some failed conversations brought death in the end.

Julie was a girl of modest means

Used to a high school beauty queen

Wound up on the wrong end of a dream

And said never again

Started livin' life for the bottom line

Married her a man well past his prime

Forty million dollars and not much time now

She's payin' for the perfect crime on


Blue, blue money

When the devil gets your soul

All that's left is a heartache made of gold


He bought her a house in the Hollywood hills

There were parties and the room was filled with

Stars fallin' from the usual thrills

It was fun for awhile

But there's a prison in paradise

They never tell you when they throw the rice

That pretty mirrors don't look so nice

When you're standing on the desperate side of


Blue, blue money

When the devil gets your soul

All that's left is a heartache made of gold


It's a Saturday night again

The same faces come tricklin' in

She's got a lover but he ain't no friend

He's just someone to hold

She feels alone and she steps outside

Stares out at the valley lights

Pours a drink and she starts to cry

She's got it all and she can't get by on


Blue, blue money

When the devil gets your soul

All that's left is a heartache made of gold

Of Albuquerque standin' in the breakdown lane

Where everything is more of the same

Either gone or just not around
And I was wrong when I said I'd change

This morning I tasted doubt
As she kissed me on my way out
And it took me twenty-two miles, too many years
And one red light for it all to come clear

That kiss really meant goodbye
That's why I floor it

Just to see her face when I get there

To show her how much I care

Sonya Hunter,"4+20 years ago
I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",4 + 20
Sonya Isaacs,"Mom bought us lemonade
On a coca-cola tray
Ice rattlin' in plastic glasses
We'd see who could drink the fastest
In a split second we were gone
Racin' cross the fresh cut lawn
And we were runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

When I was twelve I started likin' boys
She was still playin' with her toys
I pointed out that she was only nine
I didn't need her taggin' behind
Then I would jump on my red bicycle 
I'd look back, I'd get tickled
She was runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

It brings a smile to my face
Seein' her, no shoes in a foot race
Runnin' as fast as she can
Wavin' her hands and calling out my name
Little sister
Oh I wonder if she knows how bad I miss her

I remember being so confused
When mom and daddy broke the news
I never even saw her cry
Though I could tell she was hurtin' inside
But now I'm sure she has a full head of hair
And I know that somewhere up there
She's runnin' barefoot in the grass
Barefoot in the grass

It brings a smile to my face
Seein' her, no shoes in a foot race
Runnin' as fast as she can

On unseen things above
The Savior spoke unto me
And filled my heart with love

I'm gonna die on the battlefield
I'm gonna die in this war
I'm gonna die on the battlefield
With glory in my soul

I used to have some people
Who walked and talked with me
But since I've been converted
They've turned their backs on me

Some say give me silver
And some give me gold
But I say give me Jesus
Who saved my dying soul

I'm gonna die on the battlefield
I'm gonna die in this war
I'm gonna die on the battlefield
With glory in my soul

Yeah, you and me we had a ball, nothing in our way
You gave me love and a diamond ring

It's hard to hear it when we never talk at all

So you walk on the wire over the fire
Your balancing act is still intact as you keep on stalling

You've got to take a leap and let your feelings show
Just loosen up and you'll get used to letting go

'Cause that's what love demands
You must understand
The laws of gravity do not apply to love

Well I like what I see when you look at me
And I do believe the possibilities are endless
Like breakfast in bed the comfort you get
From there being two instead of just you
But still you're apprehensive

There comes a time when you've just gotta act on trust
And baby that's what's got to be between the two of us

'Cause that's what love demands
You must understand
The laws of gravity do not apply to love

You go flying when you fall
But only if you risk it all

Some cry when they wake

That paint pictures on polished walls
And dance away with doubt

All day every day, ain't no playin a tray
I'm like an ace of space, I bust I'm doin too much
Catch her in traffic I'm scoopin her up
Jumpin out the white with the park lights on
High as a kite, shootin dice all night long
I stay hustlin and mustlin to keep my effect
Smoke a quarter or a half, fuck a cheap dime sack
I'm livin to the limt or don't live it all, get it and ball
Nigga look at me and my doggz

[Bad Azz]
I floss my gold chain, with diamonds
The Italian style, the bad person Tray Davis, Soopafly, and Style
I never lost my touch not a bit
Today I'm better than I was yesterday with this 
Don't test touch my fast hand draw
If my strap is in the car, I'm going bomb to the shore
We the number one supporters, drugs, gang love
Smoke the weed, throwing up gang signs, we gangstas
Got to love, got to thugged it up for our mouth
I be on this every single day, no doubt
See me, I'm worth about 450 and ounce
I drop sixteen bars, and go buy me a car
I'm just an local universal with my vocal
Put the hip hop fan base in a choke hold 
My gang Dogg Pound, a gang of gangstas and entertainers
Sign an autograph, bangin, and we rich and we famous

No hell below us

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,

Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,

And ask me to
Open up the gate for you.
I want you, I want you,

True love they've been without it.
But all their daughters put me down

The way you toss your hips and things you've said
(Moving like an angel)
Gazing out my window on the bus
(On Washington Square)
I saw New York crack a smile for us

Blue, I hope you like me too
I've been painting pictures on my wall of you

Blue, I don't believe this is a tease
You could rule my world baby if you please
Skipping down the streets of Harlem
I hear your sweet soul calling me
If I could play the violin I'd make a symphony in

Blue, I hope you like me too
I've been painting pictures on my wall of you
Oh, blue, blue, won't you come dance with me?
There's a party in full swing right down the street

When you strut like an Italian Movie star
Taking your Cappuccinos into the park
Everybody wants to know who you are
Writing poetry until it gets dark

Dropping your dirty laundry off once a week
The delivery boys compete
But you never let them past the stoop
'Cause you know that you're the neighborhood scoop

You forgot when we were strange
Yeah somewhere we got caught
Now every little bird is tame
Their wings are clipped and gulled
Fear puts your heart on ice
For some other rainy day
You only know that your alive
When I melt the ice away

My life, my dreams my everything
Are all yours, baby
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'cause living only happens when you wait

If you go
If you stay
Sometimes better breaking, baby
In the sun
Before its gone

If you love
If you feel
If you wonder
how this heaven could be real
Then let it burn

Some might say ain't no sun
without the rain, like I know
I knew, yeah
Some might say, nothing given, nothing gained
Yes that's true, how about you baby

My life, my dreams my everything
Are all yours, baby
I'm willing to complete this act of faith
'cause living only happens when you wait

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd like, like
To be somebody who
You take a chance on
I would take a chance on you
Everyday
Like, like to be somebody
who you take a chance on
I would take a chance on you
Everyday

I got myself a son
I take my love and run
I got you babe

Oh, yeah
'Cause I need somebody's love
And half is not enough
To make me stay
I've got you babe

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I have been waiting for you
I have been storing all my devotion
It flows like an ocean now
It seems I've never felt so complete
It's like I've woken up from a deep sleep
But dreaming of you somehow
I've become fond of having you near
The way I'm fond of breathing in air
How could I be without you?

[Chorus]
Yes, my love, darling I was made for you
Never will this alter, anytime you falter
I'll be there, I'll be there
Yes, my love, I open up my heart for you
Everyday that's breaking
You will hear me saying
Love is here, love is here
Never fear, 'cause baby, love is here

And so a new beginning
My heart, my head is spinning
I'm dizzy
Yeah, you make me giddy now
You make my life have purpose
And so I'm gonna make my goal just to love you
As much as I can do, yeah
I hope you're proud of being my man
The way I'm proud of holding your hand in my hand

I've become fond of having your near
The way I'm fond of breathing in air
How could I be without you?

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"We're gonna play a game
Just you and me
You never should be won
So easily
Your eyes are on the prize
I'm worth the wait

Magic stays when myth remains
I'm under your spell
Don't release me
Never give the game away

It too easy
Leave something
For me and my imagination

Baby
I'm not in a hurry

Leave something
For me and my imagination

Your every trick
So keep me guessing just
A little bit
'Cause hidden in your eyes
There's mystery
I want to get inside
To where the

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Have we met before?
Or is that just to break the ice
If our paths had crossed
I should recall such paradise
Inside me passion's stirring
Forgive me, you're divine

My new flame speeding towards me
A new flame to warm my heart
I feel my temperature soaring
My new flame what a spark
Are you often here?
Where d'you like to go?
And can I come?
All I know for me to speak so free
It's not often done
But with the way we're heading
I figure we'll be fine

My new flame hold me together
The old flame fall apart
Around me bridges are burning
My new flame what a spark
You release me
You please me

Capsize me

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"Do it, feel it, touch it, taste it
Be it, live it, need it, take it

Just another day
I want to get away
I've got a ticket for a new adventure
No one will know our name
So we can start again
And all we're gonna do is seek out pleasure

The city calls to me
It offers what i need
We can escape and take it on together
Come away with me

[Chorus]
New york city lights so bright
We can lose ourselves
And start a new life
Run away and leave tonight
(let's do it, feel it, touch it, taste it)

Subway down to times all night
It's me on world informed alright
(do it, feel it, touch it, taste it)

I want to take your hand
Fly over sea and land

It's our time

This town gets hold of you
We'll see it written right across the skyline

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I don't know why you cry
You must have a windswept eye
They're the same old tears
You've worn for years
So they suit you better than I
I don't know why you cry
The tears are a strange device
They roll like dice
They're cold like ice
And they suit you better than I

You don't want me
But you need me
You don't have to
But you should do

[Chorus]
'Cause I may be the only one
(In the world)
Yeah I may be the only one
(In the world)
Oh I may be the only one
(In the land)
Yeah I may be the only one

So if you're feeling lonesome today
Honey, don't you dare to push me away
'Cause I may be the only one
(in the land)
Yeah I may be the only one
Who understands you, yeah

I'll take you for a ride
To see you from inside
The outlook's bleak
But when I speak
I'll see a change in your tide
I don't know why you cry
But honey make it mine
'Cause up my sleeve, I do believe
I'll change those tears into wine

You don't want me
But you need me
You don't have to
But you should do

[Chorus]

You can't see wood for all the trees
For you I'm good, permission, please
To be your girl, to hold you tight
To rock your world, you know I'm right
So come on baby, you better make a move
I won't wait forever, what have you got to lose?

[Chorus x2]",Only One
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I can see you're somewhere far away
Caught in another place
Where nothings going right
Shouldn't worry about
The worst that could be
When you're here beside me
Don't look for troubled times
Now when everything is fine

So you need to fear the bad to see the good
And that's the thing you do
But don't let it spoil the view
Of what's around you

[Chorus]
There's no rain, there's no storm
Though the blue sky makes you wonder
Don't you fear what will come
Will come
And right now we're in the sun
Sure enough, seasons change
But don't let today get lost
'Cause today the sun's on us
Today the sun's on us
You're so restless

Underneath the surface
Don't you think I notice
It's something you can't hide
When you're fighting with the tide
But you've got to let it go
And just accept the things you can't control
Don't let your shadow spoil the view
Of what's around you

[Chorus]

The years go by
Stars will rise and fall
Will you be by my side
Though it all?

Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"My eyes don't lie
They show the truth
I've fallen for you
To fight it's no use
I promised myself
I'd never give in
But your love won me around
My feet left the ground
And so here I go again

[Chorus]
What have we started?
Don't break this heart of mine
Have I been fool enough
To let you walk away with all of me?
What have we started?
I'm so far in this time
That if you hurt me now
I may never love again
Look at me now
I'm under your spell
Where does our story end?
It's for you to tell
See I'm old enough now
To understand love

What it's capable of
And the pain it can cause
Oh but here I go again

[Chorus]

I don't want to waste this chance
You could be well worth the danger
Better to have loved and lost
But it's so hard to say now I've given my heart away

[Chorus]",What Have We Started?
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,"I know you're feeling restless
Like life's not on your side
It's weighing heavy on your mind
But when we stand united
Our hearts, they beat in time
And I know we'll make it all alright

Let's bring it back to you and me
There's no one else around
Now don't get lost in gravity
'Cause I want you to

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
I know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love

'Cause I feel it inside
Take me over tonight
I'll be there when the storm is breaking
In this moment I'm yours
And you can always be sure
That together we're gonna make it
So baby, won't you

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
I know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love

Hold me now
Nothing else matters
It's just the two of us
And if it all falls down
Nothing else matters
I know we're strong enough
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
I said I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on love",Not Giving Up on Love [Jorn Van Deynhoven Rmx]
