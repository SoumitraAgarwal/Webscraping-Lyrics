Ricardo Montaner,"Tengo ganas de mirarte
Sobre un lienzo quisiera pintarte
Y ponerte rosas en el pelo
Tengo urgencia de escucharme en tu vo
Tengo esos presentimientos 
Que te vienen cuando hay sentimientos
Dame un beso de ese jugo 'e caña 
Que le brota a tu cañaveral
Resumiendo estoy enamorao' 

Como muchacho de pueblo
Resumiendo estoy como dormido 
Acostado en tu pecho, 
En esos lindos pechos
¡más quisiera yo!
Dame tu consentimiento 
Para recorrerte toditita entera
Dame tu soberanía 
Quiero ver tus límites y tus fronteras

Dame tu consentimiento 
Para conquistarte con mis carabelas
Deja hacerme de tu orilla 
Porque la corriente a lo mejor me lleva
Tengo de lo que no tengo 
Para dártelo como si tuviera
Mi alegría y mi noche entera
Mi certeza y mi inseguridad
Resumiendo estoy enamorao' 
Como muchacho de pueblo
Resumiendo estoy como dormido 

Acostado en tu pecho
En esos lindos pechos
¡más quisiera yo!
Dame tu consentimiento 
Para recorrerte toditita entera
Dame tu soberanía 
Quiero ver tus límites y tus fronteras
Dame tu consentimiento 
Para conquistarte con mis carabelas
Deja asirme de tu orilla 

Porque la corriente a lo mejor me lleva
Tengo cafecito fresco 
A las seis y media 'e la mañana
Tengo mucha ilusión de casarme 
Y llevarte a conocer caracas
Dame tu consentimiento 
Para recorrerte toditita entera
Dame tu soberanía 
Quiero ver tus límites y tus fronteras

Dame tu consentimiento 
Para conquistarte con mis carabelas
Deja asirme de tu orilla 
Porque la corriente a lo mejor me lleva
Deja asirme de tu orilla 
Porque la corriente a lo mejor me lleva
Deja asirme de tu orilla 
Porque la corriente a lo mejor me lleva",Resumiendo
Ricardo Montaner,"Contaré hasta tres
Y sin respiro alguno
Iré por ti tras los de polvo
Y aire puro estás tú

Ya no puedo más
Se muere así mi fe
Y yo también y perdóname

Si te hablo un poco fuerte
Es que yo hablo así
Yo hablo así

Yo, solo te contaré
Que soy un rey sin trono
Llorando tu retorno
Como llora el mar ya sin nosotros

Yo si fuera un rey por horas
Te compraría una historia
Y algunos mares del mundo
Y te enamoraría en un segundo
Tan solo en un segundo

A dónde voy ahora
Con pinta de infeliz
Y lo soy

Me iré a nuestro bar
Y brindaré por ti
Y por mi
Aunque no estés

Yo solo te contaré
Que soy un rey sin trono
Llorando tu retorno
Como llora el mar ya sin nosotros

Yo si fuera un rey por horas
Te compraría una historia
Y algunos mares del mundo
Y te enamoraría en un segundo
Tan solo en un segundo

",Rey Sin Trono
Ricardo Montaner,"Hola, cómo estás 
Que raro verte 
Esa semblanza blanca, blanca 
Da honores a tu palidez 
Y la casualidad es tan casual 
Si la miras mejor 
Sabias que vendría por aquí 
A ver si te veía

Luna llena, estoy de confesión 
Y como es sábado es peor 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 

Tocando su carita 
Y armando sus sonrisas rotas 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 
Y me pongo a perseguirla y no la encuentro 
Y me despierto 
Y aún despierto 
Creo seguir durmiendo

La posibilidad de convertir mi sueño 
Realidad va lejos 
Como tu palida luna
Lejos, lejos, lejos 

Luna llena estoy de confesión 
Y como es sábado es peor 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 
Tocando su carita y armando sus 
Sonrisas rojas 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
repitiéndose 
Y me pongo a perseguirla 
Y no la encuentro 
Y me despierto y aun despierto 
Creo seguir durmiendo 
Yo siempre tengo un sueño 
Repitiéndose 

Hola, como estas 
Que raro verte, 
Esa semblanza blanca, blanca, blanca",Sueño Repetido
Ricardo Montaner,"Sola, como la aurora, como la una, como 
La brisa 
Sola, como un cuento de hadas 
Sin si hada madrina
Sola, sola sin mí sin la gente
Sin la fatiga de andar mis amores 
Sin compromisos, tu vives por ahí

En cambio yo, vivo en el mar
Con tus recuerdos casi como eternidad 
Con tus olores que van 
Casi como el viento
Con tu alegría siempre a mitad 
Y en cambio yo, vio en el mar 
Con la nostalgia que no quiere que 
Olvide tu piel

Sola, como solo tú sabes 
Como un pájaro herido en un desierto 
Sola, con tus malos humores 
Como un volcán que fuma y que arde 
Sola, sin amor, sin futuro 
Vas viviendo en tu mundo 
Sin hacer ningún ruido 
Casi no te conozco 
Una sombra que no eres tú

En cambio yo vivo en el mar 
Con tus recuerdos casi como eternidad 
Con tus olores que son 
Casi como el viento 
Con la alegría siempre a mitad 
En cambio yo, vivo en el mar 
Con la nostalgia que no quiere 
Que olvide tu piel

En cambio yo vivo en el mar 
Con tus recuerdos casi como eternidad 
Con tus olores casi como el viento 
Con la alegría siempre a mitad 
Y en cambio yo vivo en el mar",Vivo En El Mar
Ricardo Montaner,"Donde brillan los mares
Y sopla fuerte el viento
En un viejo balcón
Frente al golfo de Sorrento

Un hombre abraza a una mujer
Sin contener el llanto
Se despide un vez más
Y vuelve a empezar el canto

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan mas que nunca tus palabras

Donde hay luz entre las sombras
Como el brillo de una estrella
Va dejando tras el barco
Una infinita estela

Otra gira, otras ciudades
Otra vez lejos de sus brazos
Todo gira en torno a él
Y los años van pasando

Otra carta, una llamada
Los recuerdos ya son cientos
Hay lagrimas en sus ojos
Y su voz es un lamento

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan más que nunca tus palabras

Pronto llegará a su tierra
A su patria tan querida
Pero sabe que es muy tarde
Apenas ya le queda vida

Toda su fuerza y su energía
Se la ha dejado a América
Y ahora regresa casi acabada
A su amor que aún la espera

Solo quedan más allá
Los triunfos y los fracasos
Solo los sueños de un ayer
De la espuma tras el barco

Y así cerca del final
Su corazón se va apagando
Y no habrá más despedidas
Y vuelve a empezar el canto

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto, tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Yen la distancia amor
Hoy suenan más que nunca tus palabras

Te quiero tanto amor
Te quiero tanto tanto y tu lo sabes bien
Y en la distancia amor
Hoy suenan mas que nunca tus palabras

",Caruso
Ricardo Montaner,"He venido a comentarte
El porqué todo este tiempo
Fui agotando mi paciencia
De tanto esperarte

Tantos días de pelearme
Con el reloj por ser tan lento
Vi morir en cada hora
El sentimiento

Se acabó lo que aquí tanto se daba
Fue tanta la pasión
Que ya no queda ni un beso
Fue por ti por ti

Terminábamos en la madrugada
Presos del amor
Sin ser amor ni nada
Fue por ti por ti

Un amor exagerado
Un amor un tanto endeble
Un papel que se humedece
Y se pierde

Universo de tensiones
Dos ilustres desconocidos
Una estrella con recibo de luz
Que ha vencido

Se acabó lo que aquí tanto se daba
Fue tanta la pasión
Que ya no queda ni un beso
Fue por ti por ti

Terminábamos en la madrugada
Presos del amor
Sin ser amor ni nada
Fue por ti fue por ti

Tantos días de pelearme
Con el reloj por ser tan lento
Fue a parar al piso roto
Cómo lo nuestro

Se acabó lo que aquí tanto se daba
Fue tanta la pasión
Que ya no queda ni un beso
Fue por ti fue por ti

Terminábamos en la madrugada
Presos del amor
Sin ser amor ni nada
Fue por ti por ti

",Fue Por Ti
Ricardo Montaner,"Vueltas y vueltas sigo aquí
Te juro que no quisiera
Llámalo poca fantasía
Llámalo costumbre pienso siempre en ella

Dice que no me quiere más
Ni siquiera en fotografía
Yo no le creo, no es verdad
Que colgara el teléfono si la llamo un día

Yo sin ti, quien sabe qué vida llevaría
Oh, yo sin ti dejaría todo para ir
A buscar soluciones donde no las hay
A probar mas emociones si porque

Yo sin ti viviría en la soledad
Oh, yo sin ti habría un gran vacío en la ciudad
Parece fácil olvidar, pero no es así
Tendré que arreglármelas sin ti

Vacio las gavetas, que ironía
Están llenas de sus cosas
Esta su licencia y su alcancía
Y una foto mía que se le olvido

Yo sin ti, quien sabe qué vida llevaría
Oh, yo sin ti, en la mañana no despertaría
De vez en cuando un restaurant buscando compañía
Le diría a algún extraño, sabes, ella es mía

Parece fácil olvidar, pero no es así
Si tocan a la puerta deseo que seas tú
Quién sabe qué vida llevaría, oh, yo sin ti

",Yo Sin Ti
Ricardo Montaner,"Voy a llenarte, amor, de azul la vida
Y me ir contigo hasta la laguna
Habr un aroma para cada beso y mil caricias
Suaves como espumas

Voy a colgarte, amor, una gran sonrisa
Por donde corre el rimel cuando lloras
Voy a llenarte, amor, con aire y selva
Y ser laurel lo que fue hiedra

Respirar profundo la luna
Para que el alma se me vuelva blanca
Para llenar de noche mi romance
Para rociar mi corazn de calma

Respirar muy hondo la luna
Para soplarte estrellas en el pelo
Para sentir el cielo en mi suspiro
Para dejar sin aire al mismo aire

Y mojar la lluvia nuestro abrazo
Y pasear en tu cara la llovizna
Quizs querramos esperar que aclare
O hablar bajito y respirar la luna

Respirar profundo la luna
Para que el alma se me vuelva blanca
Para llenar de noche mi romance
Para rociar mi corazn de calma

Respirar muy hondo la luna
Para soplarte estrellas en el pelo
Para sentir el cielo en mi suspiro
Para dejar sin aire el mismo aire

",Respirando la Luna
Ricardo Montaner,"Si tuviera que elegir entre la luz de la mañana y la luz de su mirada 
Cuando se mete aquí en mi alma
Si tuviera que elegir de mil amores los que quiera
O tenerla a ella solita 
Mientras dure la existencia

Si tuviera que elegir entre sufrir su amor de vuelta
Si vivir en un palacio o morir frente a su puerta

Me quedo con sus manos calzándole a mi piel
Me quedo con su angustia a un paso de caer
Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta 
La quiero así, queriéndome

Me quedo como estaba a su lado y a sus pies
Me quedo con los sueños que tuve y no logré
Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta
Con todo lo que sé y lo que no sé

Si tuviera que elegir entre las siete maravillas 
O pegada aquí en mis labios siete noches, siete días
Si tuviera que elegir entre un millón de soledades
Me quedaba con la suya, es el mejor de mis males

Si tuviera que elegir entre sufrir su amor de vuelta
Si vivir en un palacio o morir frente a su puerta

Me quedo con sus manos calzándole a mi piel
Me quedo con su angustia a un paso de caer
Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta 
La quiero así, queriéndome

Me quedo como estaba a su lado y a sus pies
Me quedo con los sueños que tuve y no logré
Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta
Con todo lo que sé y lo que no sé

Si tengo que elegir entre el oxígeno y su amor
Respira boca a boca el corazón

Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta 
La quiero así, queriéndome

Me quedo como estaba a su lado y a sus pies
Me quedo con los sueños que tuve y no logré
Me quedo con su cuerpo las horas que hagan falta

Ricardo Montaner,"Suma a los besos en tu espalda
Unas pecas de mis hombros
Y el brillito de esos ojos

Suma a tu abrazo mi sorpresa
Mi cariño a tu paciencia
Y a mi queja tu dolor

Súmale mi sequía a tu sed
Tu recuerdo a mi amnesia y después
Suma fuerzas y me soplas un suspiro

Sóplame un suspiro

Suma sueños para que sueñes conmigo
Suma amor, todo el amor de los creyentes
Y su fe a los pensamientos
Que me vienen a la mente

Suma nuestra coincidencia a tu destino
Suma miles de millones en cariños
Pero a mí nunca me restes
Ni me dejes de querer

Suma tú siempre a mi versión del infinito
Suma mi amor

Suma a tu océano mis peces
Y a la mar ponle unas redes
Pa' que no escape mi amor

Suma mi susurro a tu silencio
Tu secreto a mi secreto
Y a tu olor suma mi olor

Ricardo Montaner,"Tu cara se adueño de la noche
Y descolgaron la luna
Y te pusieron a ti

Tu cara se ha ganado mi pecho
Y ha plantado bandera
Más al centro, hacia el sur

En tu cara
Se inaugura la belleza
Se detuvo el universo
Se quedó a vivir allí

En tu cara
Se saluda la sonrisa
Con tus lágrimas que hacían
Un intento por volver

En tu cara
Mis miradas camparon
Encontró razón
Para latir mi corazón

En tu cara
Se estrellaron dos estrellas
Y si antes eras bella
Hoy tus ojos brillan más

En tu cara
He olvidado las palabras
Que cayeron de mis labios hoy
Cuando te besé

Tu cara
Me ha desnudado el alma
Y me clava miradas
Que me causan ardor

",Tu Cara
Ricardo Montaner,"Urgencia en las paredes 
Que aún escuchan sus silencios
Hay urgencia de su voz 
En los umbrales del recuerdo

Y aunque las apariencias 
Dicen que no pasa nada
A mi sombra solitaria 
Hay una sombra que le falta

Urgencia hay en las tardes 
Del encuentro clandestino
Hay urgencia de cambiar 
Las ocurrencias del destino

Y aunque todo parezca 
Tan exacto a cuando estabas
La luna solitaria se ha mudado 
A otro balcón y me hace falta

Urgente que me quema
Que me arde, que no apaga
Urgente está gritando 
Un corazón por la ventana

Urgente está saltando

Urgente está saltando

Urgencia de aguantarle 
Al llanto la respiración
Hay urgencia de desahogarle 
Los ahogos a mi amor

Y aunque todo parezca 
Que estoy dentro de un mal sueño
No tengo voluntad ni soy capaz 
De abrir los ojos y no quiero despertar

Ricardo Montaner,"Verte dormida, cerquita mio
Con la brisita que da tu respiración
Verte dormida, a media noche
Con la semblanza de estar durmiendo en paz

Verte dormida, de madrugada,

Ricardo Montaner,"La vida
Le pone encrucijadas al camino
Es sólo un episodio muy cortito, se esfuma
Sólo aprendemos cuando vamos de salida

Me dio oportunidad de conocerte
Y de creer en Dios
Y en los milagros, tenerte

La vida
Hay que librar todos los días la batalla
No te perdonan la felicidad sí ganas
Y hay que pagar la felicidad

La vida
Te da motivos para el llanto y la tristeza
Pero yo apuesto con la vida a la alegría
Y amo de corazón la vida

Resulta que tus padres son tus hijos

Al desencuentro en los dos
Y me empeño en tildarme
De culpable y desaparecerme

Me he empeñado en vestirme
De perdedor para perderte
Y si te pierdo voy y empeño
La poesía que nunca te di

Ya no vale la pena
Que te siga negando
Que al intento de un beso
Han temblado mis piernas
Y que el amor va llegando

Ya no vale la pena
Que te siga diciendo
Vete a buscar el amor
A otro amor que no te merezco

Me he empeñado
En tapar mi respiración
Cerrar los ojos, para no ver
Que estás a punto de besarme
Como a traición

Ya no vale la pena
Que te siga negando
Que al intento de un beso
Han temblado mis piernas

Hila muy fino mi madeja de palabras hila un

Cuidado que no alcanza si es que distraes el amor
Pues no se puede en el amor perder el hilo con

La muchacha esta canta que canta
Que canta a las paredes de su pecho
Su desprecio

Siempre y cuando no mencione yo
Su nombre puedo hablar
Me a pedido que no diga
Ni su nombre ni su edad

De vez en cuando la muchacha
Se va de noche a caminar la rabia
Se pone a llorar como una niña
Que aun no despertó la pesadilla

De vez en cuando la muchacha
Limpia su casa y el dolor no pasa
Restriega su alma hasta que sangra
Pobre la muchacha esta de cama y de dolor

Sola llora con frecuencia
Y quejarse ya no tiene ciencia
No hay una muerte más inmensa
Que la del amor

Sola con un gran esfuerzo
La muchacha se graduó de triste
Con un posgrado y buen promedio
En la soledad

Se va de noche a caminar la rabia

Que la ve llorando entre cuatro paredes 
Entre Dios y el universo

Necesito que me digas como explicas 
Que la luna llore tanto como yo

Al verme caminando en sentido contrario 
En sentido figurado me extinguí 
Pasé a ser un inútil todo un infeliz 

La luna llora también del horror 
Al ver que estoy vencido a punto de estallar 
Convencido que la luna 
Jamás se ha enamorado como yo 
No que va

Oye el llanto de la luna entre dolor y pena 
Se parece un poco al llanto de ballena 
Que pena, que pena 

Hoy el llanto de la luna se conoce a leguas 
Y no te sorprenda que la luna no quiera 
Que la vean llorar

Como garúa de madrugada
Moldeaste para mi otro yo
Moldeaste para mí otro todo

Boca santa que besa y mata
Que me recorre que sube y baja
Boca que a tu parecer

Poseído por tus embrujos
Medio derrocado por tus ojazos

En el suelo y en la cama

Sometido aunque no lo diga
Yo te reconozco como dueña mía
Y hágase tu voluntad
En mi alma y en mi cuerpo

Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele

Y no me puedo aguantar
Que no me puedo aguantar
Te quiero tanto que el cuerpo me duele
Y no me puedo aguantar

Que no me puedo aguantar
Y hasta tenerte me duele y me duele

Por el milagro que me ha tocado
Es como una aparición
Esa cara y esos labios

Poseído por tus embrujos

Ricardo Montaner,"La balanza va marcando un desbalance
Entre el lado que más pesa y el lado del aguante
La cincha de la vida me puso en desventaja
Por un lado tú y por otro tu ausencia

Y sigo de ambulante vendiendo fracaso
Y sigo de doliente llorando tu amor

Parado de manos
Cruzando el anden atado de mano y de pies
Mordaza en los sueños que acaso soñé
Y me mordí la lengua
Y le sangro a la luna el corazón

Y tu carencia está ganándole al olvido
Fue difícil conseguirte imposible de tenerte
Y sin embargo yo me alegro de haberte conocido
Por un lado me hizo bien y por otro frío

Y sigo de ambulante vendiendo fracasos
Y sigo de doliente llorando por tu amor

Corazón inválido infeliz
Corazón desangra hasta morir

Vale la pena que el orgullo te lo metas al bolsillo

Que tenerte no bastará
¿Qué es esto que me invita a vivir?

¿Qué me da la ilusión?
¿Qué será esa fuerza que a todos
Nos une de dos en dos?
¿Será la fuerza del corazón?

Hace que te abrace
Y los cuerpos lleguen a estorbar
Tiemblo sólo con la idea de rozar
Tus labios llenos de besos nuevos

No puedo dormir, robas mi tranquilidad
Alguien ha bordado tu cuerpo
Con hilos de mi ansiedad
De cinturón tuis piernas cruzadas

En mi espalda un reloj
Donde tus dedos son las agujas
Y dan cuerda a este motor
Que es la fuerza del corazón

Y es la fuerza que te eleva
Que te empuja y que te llena
Que te arrastra y que te acerca a Dios
Es un sentimiento casi una obsesión

Si la fuerza es del corazón
Es algo que te lía una descarga de energía
Que te va quitando la razón
Te hace tropezar, te crea confusión

Seguro que es la fuerza del corazón
Es la fuerza que te lleva
No puedo pensar, tendría que cuidarme más
Como a poco pierdo la vida y luego me la das

¿Qué es lo que va cegando al amante
Que va por ahí de señor?
Y no es más que un chiquillo
Travieso, provocador
¿Será la fuerza del corazón?

Y que te sientas mujer solamente conmigo
Hoy tengo ganas de ti, hoy tengo ganas de ti
Quiero apagar en tus labios la sed de mi alma

Y descubrir el amor juntos cada mañana

Nada más amargo, que saber que te perdí

Y donde te escondes, para llenarme de ti

Que quema mis ansias
Y mi corazón

Ternura que sin prisa apura
Caricias que brinda el amor
Caprichos muy despacio dichos
Entre la penumbra
De un suave interior

Te quiero y ya nada me importa
La vida lo ha dictado así
Si quieres yo te doy el mundo
Pero no me pidas que no te ame así

Pero no me pidas que no te ame así
Que no te ame así

Procuro Olvidarte

Pisando y Contando las hojas caidas
Procuro Cansarme
LLegar a la noche apenas sin vida
Y al ver nuestra casa tan sola y callada no se lo que hara

Lo que hara, por que estuvieras tu, por que siguieras tu conmigo
Lo que hara, por no sentirme as, por no vivir as, perdido
Lo que hara, por que estuvieras tu, por que siguieras tu conmigo
Lo que hara, por no sentirme as, por no vivir as, perdido

Procuro Olvidarte
Siguiendo la ruta de un pajaro herido
Procuro Alejarme

De aquellos lugares donde nos quisimos
Me enrredo en amores, sin ganas ni fuerzas por ver si te olvido
Y llega la noche y de nuevo comprendo que te necesito

Procuro Olvidarte
Haciendo en el da mil cosas distintas
Procuro Olvidarte

Pisando y Contando las hojas caidas
Procuro Cansarme
LLegar a la noche apenas sin vida
Y al ver nuestra casa tan sola y callada no se lo que hara

Lo que hara, por que estuvieras tu, por que siguieras tu conmigo
Lo que hara, por no sentirme as, por no vivir as, perdido
Lo que hara, por que

Ricardo Montaner,"A menudo me recuerdas a alguien
Tu sonrisa la imagino sin miedo
Invadido por la ausencia
Me devora la impaciencia
Me pregunto si algún da te veré

Ya sé todo de tu vida, y sin embargo
No conozco ni un detalle de ti
El teléfono es muy frio
Tus llamadas son muy pocas
Yo sí quiero conocerte y tú no a mí
Por favor

Dame una cita
Vamos al parque
Entra en mi vida
Sin anunciarte
Abre las puertas
Cierra los ojos
Vamos a vernos
Poquito a poco

Dame tus manos
Siente las mías
Como dos ciegos

Oh Santa Lucía

A menudo me recuerdas a mí
La primera vez pena",Santa Lucía
Ricardo Montaner,"Cuando estas lejos de mi
La canción que necesito
Suena a historia triste
A melancolía
Y a caricias que no di jamas

Y cuando estas cerca de mi
La canción que necesito
Suena a amor bonito
A pasión sorpresa
A regalo que aun no abrí

Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde va tu amor
Tu corazón
Y tu promesa
Adonde, va

Si ahora es cierto que te vas
La canción que necesito
Para ahogar de pena
Suena a amor solito
Que se muere despacito

Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde va tu amor
Tu corazón
Y tu promesa

Voy a buscar una canción que le haga daño a mi dolor
Que me haga mal
Que me corte hasta sangrar

Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde vas sin mí
Adonde va tu corazón
Adonde va tu corazón
Sin mí",La  Canción Que Necesito

Si tienes mas amor que media humanidad 

Si puedes apagar mi incendio soplándome la voz 
Anoche te toque en cámara lenta

No entiendo porque frenas tus pasiones 
Si tienes el latido a punto de estallar 
Con un dedo tapo el sol mientras tu 
Enciendes la luna anoche te toque como a ninguna

Casi alada casi heterea el centro de la tierra 
Casi mía casi siempre 
Siempre a punto de tenerte, no le temas a quererme 
Que mi amor cambio tu suerte

No entiendo porqe hierven tus tensiones 
Si tienes en mi pecho la tranquilidad 
Una vida en solitario poco menos que un calvario 
Anoche te toque sobre el tejado

Casi alada casi heterea el centro de la tierra 
Casi mía casi siempre 
Siempre a punto de tenerte, no le temas a quererme

Ricardo Montaner,"Convénceme que la semana
Contigo tiene dos domingos
Y que la noche es joven
Aunque sea madrugada
Convénceme que no hace falta
Salir corriendo a la oficina
O hoy a las tantas, quiero dormirme
Convénceme que no hay rutina
Dime que la luna es roja
Que sus mejillas son de queso
Y que venden arcoíris
Importados y eso es cierto
Que el cielo se quedo sin agua
Y que el agua se mudo al desierto
Dime mi vida, que todo esto
Termina en un final de cuento

Convénceme de ser feliz
Convénceme
Convénceme de no morir
Convénceme
Que no es igual
Felicidad y plenitud
Que un rato entre los dos
Que una vida sin tu amor

Meses de cinco semanas
Y años de cuatro febreros
Hacer agostos en tu piel
Un sábado de enero
Que el sueño se quedo despierto
Y que la rosa se vistió de perla
Dime mi vida que todo esto
Termina en un final de cuento

Convénceme de ser feliz
Convénceme
Convénceme de no morir
Convénceme
Que no es igual
Felicidad y plenitud
Que un rato entre los dos
Que una vida sin tu amor

Estar sin ti
Atado con cadenas
Viviría amando
En esclavitud

Voy burlando el tiempo
Voy jugando a hacer poemas
Y voy jugando a no pensar

Desde la tarde que te vi
Con ese otro amor
Con quien elegiste estar
Mi certeza de saber
Que eras mía se murió

Y hago una poesía que te quite de mi mente
Hago una poesía que me duela y que te aleje
Se muere el viento mueren las flores
Se hace un desierto en dos corazones
Que se murieron

En un intento mágico
Quiero imaginarme
Que estas a punto de llegar
A punto de decir que ya
Ya volví abrázame

Hago una poesía que te quite de mi mente
Hago una poesía que me duela y que te aleje

Con ese verso que con besos me rimabas

Hazme sentir por una vez que te importaba

Hazme volver a pesar de que los años hacen trisas
A pesar de que mi letra no se entienda
Tú sabes bien lo que me urge una palabra
Tú sabes bien lo que es la soledad y lo que mata

Hazme regresar
Cuéntame una historia que me haga regresar
Muéstrame un camino que me vuelva a mi cabal
Huyo sin saber dónde estás
Hazme regresar
Escríbeme una carta y me la entregas al llegar
Háblame despacio que me cuesta respirar
Hazme que regrese

Pa' que sepa todo el mundo que no he muerto

Después de anoche
Renunciar a darnos algo
Total ya está, ya dije, ya dijiste
Que no iba más nomas
No imagino lo que sientes

Yo te pienso y presiento
Y no logro ver el amor del otro lado
El amor del otro lado
No me perdono a mí mismo por no haberte amado
Y por no haber estado allí
Y comprendo que ahora tú cambies de idea
Dejándome infeliz y que el viejo piano no suene nunca más.
Un beso nunca más, una palabra, una sonrisa, una posibilidad
El piano nunca más, un beso nunca más, una caricia,
Un mimo está prohibido desde hoy

Hoy llueve en serio y el tráfico destruye la ciudad
Y yo impaciente
Aunque nadie espera ya, nadie espera ya
Te juro en serio, no había imaginado este final
De lluvia y viento, de llanto y mal humor

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

You've just got to see me through another day

Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

Bajo el burlon
mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.",Volver

Ricardo Scales,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love (Solo Piano)

It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on

There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town

Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway

Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Gotta keep rockin' why I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
But when my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand

And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
We're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar Town",Guitar Town

Come se fosse terra
Cancellerò quei segni
Dell'ultima tua guerra

E brucerò col fuoco
Quest'erba tua cattiva
E ti farò con l'acqua
Più fertile e più viva

E pregherò che il sole
Asciughi questo pianto
E pregherò che il tempo
Guarisca le ferite

Poi costruirò una serra
Intorno al tuo sorriso
Farò della tua vita
Un altro paradiso

Sarò il tuo contadino
E tu la terra mia
Combatterò col vento
Che non ti porti via

Poi spargerò il mio seme
Nella tua verde valle
E aspetteremo insieme
Che venga primavera
Che venga primavera

Riccardo Cocciante,"Io non posso stare fermo con le mani nelle mani
Tante cose devo fare prima che venga domani
E se lei già sta dormendo io non posso riposare
Farò in modo che al risveglio non mi possa più scordare
Perché questa lunga notte, non sia nera più del nero
Fatti grande dolce luna e riempi il cielo intero
E perché quel suo sorriso possa ritornare ancora
Splendi sole domattina come non hai fatto ancora

E per poi farle cantare, le canzoni che ha imparato
Io le costruirò un silenzio che nessuno ha mai sentito
Sveglierò tutti gli amanti, parlerò per ore ed ore
Abbracciamoci più forte, perché lei vuole l'amore

Poi corriamo per le strade e mettiamoci a ballare
Perché lei vuole la gioia, perché lei odia il rancore
E poi coi secchi di vernice coloriamo tutti i muri
Case, vicoli e palazzi, perché lei ama i colori
Raccogliamo tutti i fiori, che può darci primavera
Costruiamole una culla, per amarci quando è sera
Poi saliamo su nel cielo, e prendiamole una stella
Perché Margherita è buona, perché Margherita è bella

Perché Margherita è dolce, perché Margherita è vera
Perché Margherita ama, e lo fa una notte intera

Riccardo Cocciante,"Quando finisce un amore così com'e' finito il mio
Senza una ragione ne' un motivo, senza niente
Ti senti un nodo nella gola, ti senti un buco nello stomaco
Ti senti un vuoto nella testa e non capisci niente
E non ti basta più un amico e non ti basta più distrarti

E non ti basta bere da ubriacarti
E non ti basta ormai più niente
E in fondo pensi, ci sarà un motivo
E cerchi a tutti i costi una ragione
Eppure non c'e' mai una ragione
Eerché un amore debba finire

E vorresti cambiare faccia, e vorresti cambiare nome
E vorresti cambiare aria, e vorresti cambiare vita
E vorresti cambiare il mondo, ma sai perfettamente
Che non ti servirebbe a niente

Perché c'e' lei, perché c'e' lei
Perché c'e' lei, perché c'e' lei
Perché c'e' lei nelle tue ossa
Perché c'e' lei nella tua mente
Perché c'e' lei nella tua vita
E non potresti più mandarla via

Nemmeno se cambiassi faccia
Nemmeno se cambiassi nome
Nemmeno se cambiassi aria
Nemmeno se cambiassi vita
Nemmeno se cambiasse il mondo
Però, se potessi ragionarci sopra

Saprei perfettamente che domani sarà diverso
Lei non sarà più lei io non sarò lo stesso uomo
Magari l'avrò già dimenticata magari se potessi ragionarci sopra
E se potessi ragionarci sopra ma non posso, perché

A lucky star's above but not for me

Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore

Dolce come il suono della pioggia sopra i tetti
Bello come quando torno a casa e tu mi aspetti
Strano e colorato come un film americano io ti amo

Forte come il gusto della grappa contadina
Bianco come il trenta di dicembre la mattina
Sotto questo cielo preso da una cartolina siamo soli

Piccolo piccolo piccolo amore

Grande amore detto all'ultimo gettone
Vero come il caldo di un abbracio alla stazione
Bello como quando posso stringerti la mano io ti amo

Prepotente come il bacio che ci ha fatto innamorare
Diffidente come un gatto nel lasciarsi accarezzare
See'e una cosa di piu di tutte che non so dimenticare io ti amo

Invitante come l'aria di una notte in piena estate
Delicato come il suono delle vecchie serenate

Le stelle appiccicate siamo soli

Rice Brothers,"Those heartaches now are on my way
What makes you want to be that way
You cheated on me and you lied
You put teardrops in my eyes

   I found out what they say is true
   I hope someday that you'll be blue
   And then you'll know dear why I cry
   With these teardrops in my eyes

I heard the rumors all around
That someday you'd let me down
I turn my head when gossip flies
Cause it puts teardrops in my eyes

I never thought you'd let me down
But now at last I understand
You wrecked our life and broke our vows
You'll have to pay for it somehow",That's When I'll Stop Loving You
Rice Brothers,"There are songs that birds don't sing to people
There are secrets you keep right through to the end
There are heros they hide until forever
And I'm singin' this song for one of them

He's the man that you passed on the road there
The one with his life on the loose
Goin' either somewhere or nowhere
Goin' without me without you

For he is this world's constant orphan
Travelin' out his long time
Livin' on apples from orchards
And dyin' from grapes on the vine

You can find him in big city winters
Out where the mission bell crys
And sorrow echos through the suburbs
And tries to close all his eyes

And dream of his railroad existance
As if it were some kind of dream
As if the extent of the distance
Were what his heart would go him

You can find him in Pittsburg at Christmas
You can find him in Buffalo in June
And he knows all the back roads between them
Like a Gypsy he pulls a broom

And it's route twenty-two all over again
Stake it well down and try to look like sombody's friend
Look strong at the men smile for the girls
Puzzle at the rest of the world

"Rice, Rice, Hillman & Pedersen","4+20 years ago
I come into this life
The son of a woman
And a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor
And he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more

A different kind of poverty now upsets my soul
Night after sleepless night
I walk the floor and I want to know
Why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?

Morning comes to sunrise
And I'm driven to my bed
I see that it is empty
And there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast
I grow weary of the torment
Can there be no peace?
And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease.",4 + 20

J'fais la pâtée pour les cochons

J'ai d'la vaillance plus qu'i n'en faut
Ici qui c'est qui fait l'boulot... c'est moi...

La baronne c'est une mijaurée
Qu'est pas capable de surveiller
C'est moi qui dirige la maison
J'compte les bouteilles et les chapons
Et pis les liquettes du baron
Faut avoir comme dit Monsieur l'Maire,
Un oeil au bal, l'autre au cimetière
Qui c'est qui sue même en hiver... c'est moi...

Faudrait pas croire qu'j'soye un laideron
Les gars me courent au cotillon
Si n'gardent point leurs mains dans leurs poches

Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be

Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears
Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto, your world, ghetto

Throw 'em up if you know what the hood like
Throw 'em up if you lookin' for that good life
Throw 'em up if ya ghetto, shit

We kick it too hard, you went too deep
Say you feel it in your heart, so
I'm a be real 'cause you give me what I want
And I ain't gonna tell you I love you if I don't

And I don't see you again I guess we can
Just be, woo

In and out of my life, I want friend that be

Someone to take it back to the eye's level
I want somebody to always run back to me
And trust I'll always be here with that cool thang

Still be there for me if I lost it all today?
Would ya care for me? Yeah, would you write me?

Remember when they could catch a charge down in Atlanta
They underestimate me 'cause I'm comin' from Alabama

They beat him in that boot camp 'til he died in that ambulance
That boy was only fifteen years old, fuck what they say he did
So tell me how I'm 'posed to feel when police killin' kids?

And then we can't get a job, ridin' we get them pounds
If it ain't that coke then we get that 'dro and break it down

Boy, better think twice that dope have you doin' life

They tore down the projects, so where we gon' move next?

For the people in ya family that ain't got nothin'
When it's all said and done, what do you own?

You don't own nothin', you don't own you
The nigga playin' basketball, he don't own that jersey
He can't even be in a commercial with his name on the back
So when it's really all said and done
What did you do this for? What difference did you make?

You see how the world changin', yeah, they look so dumb, ain't it?
Wish they just kill 'em all, so now the Middle East, they bangin'
Preachers in that pulpit, say they teach that bullshit
So how we know it's bullshit? Same niggas I went to school with

Grabbin' on yo' nuts and disrespectin' get you merked
Well, them young niggas got pistol grips

Drove a Honda
Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama
The real grown type
She was always right
Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world
And even told Shanda 
You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up
Mamma found out and had Sam arrested
Now Shanda at the doctor?s cause she wanna get tested
When the results came back it was positive
That?s the thing about life; you learn and you live

It was a girl named Courtney
She was fine as hell
She was looking for a man with a lotta mail
She had big dreams about the real good life
And everything she wanted had a real high price
Like Dolce Gabbana, Gucci and Prada
So if you ain?t spend big Courtney ain?t holler
She all about the dollar, but let?s go way back
When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope
She stuck with two kids and no child support
I did it for girls taking life for a joke

Rich Chambers,"When I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way
See is for the Christ Child born upon this day H is for Herald Angels in the night
Are means our redeemer I means Israel S is for the stars that shone so bright
(T is for three wise men they who traveled far M is for the manger where he lay)
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day

That's why there's a Christmas Day",C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S
Rich Chambers,"Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin'Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99

A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted ""Judge don't take my boy this way""
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away

Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand

Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line",Johnny 99

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, end up shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Baileys
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid

Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is I owe 100, 100, 100 favors
I give you 100 favors, 100, 100, 100 favors

Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds
Bitches come in dumpin' 'cause they ran a hundred miles
Rain still pourin', the bottles lift up
Stuntin' on them bitches and the whips flamed up
The sun do shine, Christmas every day
Them holidays comin', so you know we quick to spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

I'mma need a mountain of money
An amount that amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny
Back to the money, Dada
Give a nigga bread like ""bless you"" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like ""voila""
Ain't nothin' changed but the dollars
Niggas so lame 'cause they ain't gon' claim I'm they father
I'm one of the niggas that don't fold
Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy
I've been known to get niggas in one ""blap!""
When I trip up, it's foreign - when I grip up, it's foreign
When I fuck, bitch foreign

Every single morning that a nigga get out of bed
Kknow a nigga gotta get it
Money to burn, raw OG kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?
Musson, I ain't gotta put a key in it
True don, make me wanna whip in it
Different money - add another didget
Get this money then I slide and I'm gone
Y'all already know who's side that I'm on
YMCMB my nigga - Rich Gang, everything far from the norm
From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms
We try to compete 'til they go bankrupt, and we're just gettin' warm
If you ain't know, motherfucker, you can take another look, nigga
Whole team strong
And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song
I don't need to tell 'em, they already know what it is
We run every city and we runnin' every block, nigga
Respect this conglomerate, bitch, 'cause you can't reach the #1 spot

Everyday is sunshine

I was born by the river with the sunblock
Say I'm cooking up the heat so I'mma stay hot
And just like that river, I've been running ever since
I know I can't go wrong if I'm on top
I've got the shine on me, when I say me he's gotta ride for the team
Cause I'm on that
The sun hit me every morning, the club with them models
Come and feel 'em like I'm calling
The Don Perrier, probably like a cactus
Throwing every Franklin, I'm a Tim Jackson
Action the napkins, wet, no cash, got a milly after taxes
I'm on the road to winning, I've been exposed to women
Already know what they getting but with the flow in the middle
They gotta think twice

No intermission in the mission
All of my idols big pimping, all of my rivals been missing
This right here ain't revival, this right here is the birth of an idol
This right here is why I work for the title, I gotta be an icon
My old man had dreams of putting nice, he rest in peace
A lil bit of him rest in me
Every time that I'm blessed to be
I work hard, got scars, I got a mother I provide for
I got homies I would die for
A big sis I would lie for but I ain't relying on this record
No, I'm working on my vernacular
I'm tryina have a lil' brains to back it up
I used to roll around town in a maxima
Now my next step looking spectacular
And that right there is a blessing
Truest evil when this shit go wrong, don't stress it
'Cause sometime the universe testing you

Everyday is sunshine
Everyday is sunshine

Fade those lights, paid that price and did it
Overnight when we shoot that dice
And I'll probably fly, play that game and did it
Hustle from the bottom and get it
Get this money then flip it
Swag, Louis, Gucci, Red Flag
Louboutin, foreign cash, hundred dollars on my kite
Hundred dollars on my flight, hundred G's every night

Asking me where I’m at
Told her,” Baby I’m on one but your destination is next”
Now I’m coming down on that freeway that UGK in my deck
Got that “Take It Off “on replay like Pimp C said it
Now she texting me she need it bad because she ain’t have good in so long
And I’m like,’Damn shorty I’m speeding fast and when I get to you girl it’s on’
And when I make it there juss wanna to see that ass
No boy shorts and no thong
She got that ocean hair but nigga sinking quick
Rock the boat on my Aaliyah shit
I hit the block and showed up in a beastin’ whip
I see Ciroc is poured up and Keisha lit
I know your neighbors probably never heard of me
But they gon’ know my name when you screaming it
'Cause I'm going in, going in
At The same time I'm showing out
Got her legs shaking, rolling round
And her head crazy like a robot

I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil' dramatic but it compliment her style
Late nights we get romantic
Need a babysitter for her child
If I whip her she like ooh child
Imma hit that pussy all night wake up another two rounds

Laced up and it's a velvet ?
Silent niggas think she gold digging
Truth be told she got more than you
So what the hell you think she need with your figures?
Ain't nothing better so I drop whatever
I'm doin' down when she call
Really ain't nothing with her it go down whatever
From the bedroom to the wall
It's the ones who bad with hustle that never ask for nothing
That a nigga wanna give all
Every time I hit it man I need some more I notice
I can't resist it's when the dope is potent
Shorty ride this dick just like a roller coaster
Likes to drive it quick then in a slower motion
I be hitting it like I got sentenced to life
I’m going dumb I’m so unfocused
It’s a trill nigga, trill nigga
All she want is a trill nigga
Most you lames couldn’t deal with her
I knock it out ?

I could tell she had her shit when she smiled
Shorty lil' dramatic but it compliment her style

I know dem hatas talkin, but they ain't sayin nothin
I hope they stay inside they place ima continue stuntin
My ice tha shit I'm probably at a hundred stacks, and runnin
I guess I'm fly 'cause my doors in da air and my trunk is hummin 
I'm still movin slow, my swagga is jus got off da chain
Whether in the club, way in da hood I'm still gon make it rain
Yea, I'm tha truth so please address it when you say my name(Trae)
Ya try to take it to me, ima try to take it to ya brain

We put them drinks down and put them tools up
And if dude trippin we hit dude up
And you shit if you ain't never been screwed up [x2]

We drop the top down and chunk the duece up

And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up [x2]

[Verse 3: Trae]
Its still tha same name new dip, new shoes
50 on da frame so I know I won't loose
Sittin so fly doors up when I cruise
All eyes on me everytime a nigga move
I pop another trunk and show the world I'm screwed up
They say a different color chain make ya put ya jewels up
Say bitch ya betta chill 'cause I beat ya dude up
Put him on da sideline and have his face bruised up, all screwed up
Oh yeah, these diamonds in my mouth show'em I rep tha south
They say a thousand dolla bitch got tha top tuken ova
Up in these streets I'm like a kid 'cause I love to get lost 
And keep packin somethin that love to break a hata off
So when it come to this gangsta homey I got it locked
And if I put tha drop on tha block, I'm unable to stop
And when it come to what I do I'm tha numba one spot
They know I represent fo Screw and H.A.W.K. bangin my music top

You know me? I go direct with it

Put her name on it, nigga

You know it was hard to hear at first

And these bitches bound to get hurt
‘Cause a lot of these niggas be playin’
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I’m the man

Small talk I don't do that
Get rich homie, you knew that
It’s a damn shame, I don’t gang bang
But I beat a nigga blue black
I’m in the old school, no do-rag
Them old folk like how you do that?
He ain’t fooling me, this ain’t new to me
That ain’t an Aston Martin, that’s a new Jag
But it clean, though and if you’re late on the payment
Boy, that shit get repo’d
And your bitch easy
I got her on the line and I’m in her like a free throw
Getting deep throat, at the Fontainebleau
We running trains on these freak hoes
And I told my nigga that I decoded
“Blah blah blah blah”
Quit going in on these niggas
I won’t stop stop stop stop
Keep putting my money over these bitches
‘Til I’m at the top top top top
And you niggas can’t stop my vision

Rich Kids on LSD,"Betrayed
Feelings of rejection, no false hopes or misconception
Just a burning in my head and in my heart
Promises were made, friendship lost along the way

A twisted path of lies, deception from the start
The future lay in your hands with talk of stardom, all your plans 
We had our dreams, high hopes, we trusted you
But the decisions that you made

And the staring role you played
Quickly made us realize what we must do
And I gave my trust to you
Got stabbed in the back and left for dead

Why'd you do the things you do?
With all the lies, deceit, wrong things got said
Never expected this of you
I should've known better than to do what I did

I was blind and you were shrewd
Had me eating from your hand like a naive little kid
Laid down my guard, wound up screwed

There comes a time in every life 
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes

Avoiding the pain and all the rage from knowing 
That you've been betrayed

Never again will I trust you
Left for dead, knife buried in my back 
I wish I would have knew
Your sneakiness, plan of attack

This is what you do
Lying, cheating, and all that crap
No chance for number two
With my guard held high and my wall built strong
Next time around I'll screw you

There comes the time in all of our lives 
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Not knowing why we made them, just the outcome
And the feelings they create 

Whether it's sadness, loss of trust, death, pain, forgiveness,
Love, joy, sex, happiness, or fate,
It's one of these, the biggest one, that I really hate
It's a feeling you get when a trust so deep 

A trust between friends has been broken
And you know you got played, it's that feeling
You straight up been betrayed

And I'm not head over heels, and I'm not on cloud nine 
And I don't think love is blind

You still choose to be mine 
With a love that will stand even when I fall down 
I know you'll pick me up somehow

Asking only for Your grace

All those empty dreams I chased 

And when my body lies in the ruins 
Of the lies that nearly ruined me 
Will You pick up the pieces 
That were pure and true 
And breathe Your life into them 
And set them free? 

And when You start this world over 
Again from scratch 
Will You make me anew 
Out of the stuff that lasts? 
Stuff that's purer than gold is 
And clearer than glass could ever be 
Can I be with You? 
Can I be with You? 

And everybody all and each 
From the day that we are born 
We have to learn to walk beneath 
Those mercies by which we're drawn 
And now we wrestle in the dark 
With these angels that we can't see 
We will move on although with scars

That you've probably heard 
And at the risk of being redundant 
I'm gonna tell you something 
That may not thrill you

Writing of the Israelites 
It's the story of David 
And how he slew Goliath 

Well now the king of his country 
He didn't trust in him much 
And so to David's alarm 
He tried to fit him in his armor 
But the thing was so heavy 
David couldn't stand up 
So he left it by the river 
Where he gathered five smooth stones 
I guess it's safe to say he figured 
He wasn't going out alone

That you can't sing in your songs

And so sometimes you pray and sometimes you sing 
And when you love you thank the Lord for everything 

There's a rest you can find in your work 
That you can't get out of sleep 
And there's a healing that may hurt 
And there's a war that must be waged for peace

Why do they plot and scheme? 
Their bullets can't stop the prayers we pray

Where are the thorns that drew His blood? 
Well, the thorns have turned to dust

Who was gentle and true and kind 
And the donkey saw an angel with a sword 
So he slipped old Balaam past him 
And when he done it three times 
Well, Balaam got so me mad he beat the donkey 
And so the Lord 
Well, he gave the donkey language 
And the donkey plainly brayed, 
""Well, there's an angel about to strike you from the path"" 
Then old Balaam's eyes were opened 
And he realized he'd been saved 
By his donkey from the angel of God's wrath

Who was pleasing to a man 
And the man that she was pleasing was a king 
But her people's lives were threatened 
By some wicked men's plans 
Nobody knew just how the lord was gonna intervene 
Well, Mordecai her uncle, he was honest but he was smart 
And he knew that Esther's beauty was a gift 
He said, ""Maybe you could cook some supper 
Maybe you could change a king's heart

He'd led a hundred men, and lived alone among the graves 
He had a thousand questions, and a million heartaches

She was caught in a sin, she knew the well was so deep 
She threw her last pennies in, and poured oil upon His feet 
She touched the garment's hem, she had only been asleep 
She was everyman, she was everyman 

And the Lord looks down and He understands 
The world draws up it's lines 
But at the foot of the cross there's room for everyone 
And love that is not blind 
It can look at who we are and still see beyond 
The differences we find 
But with thorns in His brow and a spear in His side 
Nails in His hand, He died for you and I 
For you and I and everyman 

He had nets to mend, he gave his fish and his loaves 
He had to wash his hands, and ran away without his robe 
He couldn't understand, until on Damascus road 
He was everyman, he was everyman 

She brought the world a lamb, and took warning from a dream 
From an empty tomb she ran, for her children she would weep 
In her womb a baby danced, she'd been waiting for a King 
She was everyman, she was everyman

Bleeding and falling apart

Well I've been around enough to know that that was the lie 
That held back the tears in the eyes of a thousand prodigal sons

And our Father still waits and He watches down the road 
To see the crying boys come running back to His arms
And be growing young 
Growing young 
I've seen silver turn to dross 
Seen the very best there ever was 
And I'll tell you, it ain't worth what it costs 
And I remember my father's house 
What I wouldn't give right now 
Just to see him and hear him tell me that he loves me so much

And when I thought that I was all alone 
It was your voice I heard calling me back home 
And I wonder now Lord 
What it was that made me wait so long 
And what kept You waiting for me all that time 
Was Your love stronger than my foolish pride 
Will You take me back now, take me back and let me be Your child 
'Cause I've been broken now, I've been saved 
I've learned to cry, and I've learned how to pray 
And I'm learning, I'm learning even I can be changed

Rich Mullins,"Hello old friends 
There's really nothing new to say 
But the old, old story bears repeating 
And the plain old truth grows dearer every day 
When you find something worth believing 
Well, that's a joy that nothin' could take away 

And so we meet again 
After all these many years 
Did we sow the seeds we're reaping 
Now that the harvest calls us here 
It seems that love blooms out of season 
And much joy can blossom from many tears

And let love be stronger than the feelings

Where people live in perfect peace 
Where there is food on every plate 
Where work is rewarded and rest is sweet 
Where the color of your skin 
Won't get you in or keep you out

Its hard fought war against fear and doubt 
And everyone I know wants to go there too

Do I turn to the left? 
Do I turn to the right? 
When I turn to the world they gave me this advice

But my heart just led me into my chest 
They said follow your nose

But the Father of hearts and the Maker of noses 
And the Giver of dreams He's the one I have chosen 
And I will follow Him 
I believe there'll come a time 
Lord, I pray it's not too far off 
There'll be no poverty or crime 
There'll be no greed and we will learn how to love 
And children will be safe in their homes 
And there'll be no violence out on the streets 
The old will not be left alone 
And the strong will learn how to care for the weak 
And everyone I know hopes it comes real soon 
But when I ask 'em where I'd find it they seem so confused 
Do I find it in the day? 
Do I find it in the night?

Then I wake in the world that I'm partly made of

Rich Mullins,"And the coal trucks come a-runnin' 
With their bellies full of coal 
And their big wheels a-hummin' 
Down this road that lies open like the soul of a woman 
Who hid the spies who were lookin' 
For the land of the milk and the honey 
And this road she is a woman 
She was made from a rib 
Cut from the sides of these mountains 
Oh these great sleeping Adams 
Who are lonely even here in paradise 
Lonely for somebody to kiss them 
And I'll sing my song ~ and I'll sing my song 
In the land of my sojourn 

And the lady in the harbor 
She still holds her torch out 
To those huddled masses who are 
Yearning for a freedom that still eludes them 
The immigrant's children see their brightest dreams shattered 
Here on the New Jersey shoreline in the 
Greed and the glitter of those high-tech casinos 
But some mendicants wander off into a cathedral 
And they stoop in the silence 
And there their prayers are still whispered 
And I'll sing their song, and I'll sing their song 
In the land of my sojourn 

Nobody tells you when you get born here 
How much you'll come to love it 
And how you'll never belong here 
So I call you my country 
And I'll be lonely for my home 
And I wish that I could take you there with me 

And down the brown brick spine of some dirty blind alley 
All those drain pipes are drippin' out the last Sons Of Thunder 
While off in the distance the smoke stacks 
Were belching back this city's best answer 

And the countryside was pocked 
With all of those mail pouch posters 
Thrown up on the rotting sideboards of 
These rundown stables like the one that Christ was born in 
When the old world started dying 
And the new world started coming on 
And I'll sing His song, and I'll sing His song 
In the land of my sojourn 

In the land of my sojourn 
And I will sing His song 
In the land of my sojourn""",Land of My Sojourn

I love you more than your mask 
And you know you have to trust this to be true 
And I know that's much to ask 
But lay down your fears, come and join this feast 
He has called us here, you and me 

And may peace rain down from Heaven 
Like little pieces of the sky 
Little keepers of the promise 
Falling on these souls 
This drought has dried 
In His Blood and in His Body 
In the Bread and in this Wine 
Peace to you 
Peace of Christ to you 

And though I love you, still we're strangers 
Prisoners in these lonely hearts 
And though our blindness separates us 
Still His light shines in the dark 

And His outstretched arms are still strong enough to reach 
Behind these prison bars to set us free 

So may peace rain down from Heaven 
Like little pieces of the sky 
Little keepers of the promise 
Falling on these souls the drought has dried 
In His Blood and in His Body 
In this Bread and in this Wine

And the land that shapes the sea 
And I do not know yet what I am made of

And it is the wood that makes a carpenter 
It's the very tools of his trade 
And it is love that makes a lover 
And a cross that makes a saint 

Here is my song, listen if you will 
But I have no heart for it anymore 
I just have half a mind to cut it loose 
And if it sails off into the blue 
Then I'll just let it soar 
And the sky is better keeping 
And I won't be any poorer 
For giving it its freedom 
And here's one for freedom

Rich Mullins,"On the road to Damascus
I was hung in the ropes of success
When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death

And I wanna thank You, Lord
More than all of my words can say
(I give my life)
And I give my life to sing Your praise

And all those fortunes I hoarded
They were the well from which my poverty sprang
Oh, they led me to no greater glory
And they left me with no less shame

And I wanna thank You, Lord
More than all of my words can say
(I give my life)
So I give my life to sing Your praise

I say I wanna give You glory Lord, and I do
But everything that I could ever find to offer comes from You
But if my darkness can praise Your light
Give me breath, and I'll give my life to sing Your praise

On the road to Damascus
I was hung in the ropes of success
When You stripped away the mask of life
They had placed upon the face of death

And I wanna thank You, Lord

And I give my life to sing Your praise

(And beyond this I would not beg)
For anything except the grace
(To give my life to sing Your praise)
And beyond this I would not beg
(For anything except the grace)
To give my life to sing Your praise

(And beyond this I would not beg)
For anything except the grace

O Eli
There's a sanctity in your innocence

A certain beauty and no uncertain strength
That brings me to the faith
I don't know if I
If I am climbing to or falling in

But it comes like grace from your tiny hands
When I hold you in mine
And I pray that the eyes
Of your heart

Shine bright
With the hope to which you're called
And may you know with all the saints
The height, the depth, the width, and the length

Of the love of God
O Eli
There's a joy in your sweet abandon
Like the cowgirl ballerina

Leaves that ride
The wild and holy bucking wind that the sky
Sent through you to blow away these walls I've built
That leave me free to be a child

And I pray that the eyes
Of your heart
Shine bright
With the hope to which you're called

Hidden very safely in a shell 
But I knew somehow I'd have to run that risk 
Have to open up myself 
Look at the stars on the face of the sky 
They're the same ones Abraham saw 
Come under my wings I will make you shine 
Give you strength enough to love 
Oh, now I'm getting strong enough 
You helped me chip my way out and open myself up 
And for the snow that comes with winter 
For the growth that comes from pain 
For the joke I can't remember 
Although the laughter long remains 
For the faith that brought to finish 
All I doubted at the start 
Lord, I give you praise for all that makes 
For the hatching of a heart 
Well my face was smooth and featureless 
Just like an egg 
And if I was moved you would never guess it 
By the look upon my face 
But You said man looks without but I look within 
I can see the love you hide 
It's a matter of doubt it's a symptom of sin 
It's a problem of too much pride 
And I, now I'm opening up wide 
Wet feathers pulled out from beneath me 
And You're teaching me to fly 
For the strength that comes with friendship 
For the warmth that comes with hope 
And for the love time can't diminish 
And for the time love takes to grow 
And for the moonlight on the water 
And for the bright and morning star

And then the caller's voice 
Well it rang out beneath the moon 
And then the boys took their girls and they started to reel 
And they were singin' how do you, how do you feel 
And then the people in the town said that they'd call the police 
If we didn't keep down all this disturbin' their peace 
And Officer Black, you know he answered their pleas 
And he ran up on the hill just to see 
Well he hid in the bushes just a stone's throw away

Singin', how do you do, how do you feel 
And then the townspeople asked him if he'd make some arrests 
Could they find peace and quiet so they could go back to bed 
He said if it's peace that you want, you're gonna find it on the hill 
But the silence that you keep is the silence that kills 
So the townspeople all got so uptight and mad 
You know they fired him on the spot 
And then they threw away his badge 
Then they asked him to leave and he said gladly I will

Rich Mullins,"Where could I go, where could I run
Even if I found the strength to fly
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn
And crashed through the corner of the sky

If I sailed past the edge of the sea
Even if I made my bed in Hell
Still there You would find me

'Cause nothing is beyond You
You stand beyond the reach
Of our vain imaginations
Our misguided piety

The heavens stretch to hold You
And deep cries out to deep
Singing that nothing is beyond You
Nothing is beyond You

Time cannot contain You
You fill eternity
Sin can never stain You
Death has lost its sting

And I cannot explain the way You came to love me
Except to say that nothing is beyond You
Nothing is beyond You

If I should shrink back from the light
So I can sink into the dark
If I take cover and I close my eyes
Even then You would see my heart

And You'd cut through all my pain and rage
The darkness is not dark to You
And night's as bright as day

Nothing is beyond You
You stand beyond the reach
Of our vain imaginations
Our misguided piety

The heavens stretch to hold You
And deep cries out to deep
Singing that nothing is beyond You
Nothing is beyond You

And time cannot contain You
You fill eternity
Sin can never stain You
And death has lost its sting

And I cannot explain the way You came to love me
Except to say that nothing is beyond You
Nothing is beyond You

Prisoners in these lonely hearts 
And though our blindness separates us 
Still His light shines in the dark 
And His outstretched arms are still strong enough to reach 
Behind these prison bars to set us free

With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon

But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind

Rich O'Brien,"Twilight falls, 
Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",A Maiden's Prayer

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower

Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all",The Winner Takes It All
Richard Allen,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
A couple of years ago.",Dreaming of You
Richard Anthony,"J´ai pensé qu´il valait mieux
Nous quitter sans un adieu.
Je n´aurais pas eu le cœur de te revoir
Mais j´entends siffler le train,
Mais j´entends siffler le train,
Que c´est triste un train qui siffle dans le soir

Je pouvais t´imaginer, toute seule, abandonnée
Sur le quai, dans la cohue des ""au revoir"".
Et j´entends siffler le train,
Et j´entends siffler le train,
Que c´est triste un train qui siffle dans le soir

J´ai failli courir vers toi, j´ai failli crier vers toi.
C´est à peine si j´ai pu me retenir!
Que c´est loin où tu t´en vas,
Que c´est loin où tu t´en vas,
Auras-tu jamais le temps de revenir?

J´ai pensé qu´il valait mieux
Nous quitter sans un adieu,
Mais je sens que maintenant tout est fini!

Richard Anthony,"I can't stay mad at you

You can make me cry
You can break my heart
But I'll never say we're through
Even when I cry, I can't stay mad at you

You can run around
You can tell me lies
But there's nothing I can do
I'll never say goodbye 
Cause I can't stay mad at you

I got mad at you last night
When you were holding another girl tight
But when I thought of all your charms
I bounced back in to your arms

One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you

I bounced right back into your arms

One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you

You got me where you want me

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggy May

In the morning on a white bicycle
In the morning on a white bicycle I will ride to you

I woke up face down in the snow
From a dream that started seven years ago
Didn't know where I could be
I can't believe I'd sold so many parts of me

To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me
To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me

I woke up face up in the sand
From a dream I know I'll never understand
Didn't know if it was real
I just remember how alone I can feel

To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me
To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me
To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me
To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me

In the morning on a white bicycle
Afternoon I'm on a red bicycle
In the evening on a black bicycle, I will ride to you

To the pure, from deep in the purest part of me

Aimed for my shadow with a switchblade

Now its the law
Now its the law of the jungle.

They looked both ways and crossed the river

And had no other words to say

As into my arms he pressed
He cried ""my love, don't you murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity""

I drug her down to the golden sands
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup, because of love.

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands,
Like the wind it covers our land,
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man, this thing called love.
It can lift you up, it can put you down,
Take your world and turn it around,
Ever since time nothing's ever been found, stronger than love.

Some men are like me, they worry and doubt,
Trouble their minds day in and day out,
Too busy with livin' to worry about, a thing called love.

But then I see a mother's tenderness,
As she holds her young close to her breast,
Then I think by God this world was blessed, with a thing called love.

I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Richard Buckner,"The kitchen drawers were open
Hot water in the bath
And the phone call that you promised me
I'd given up on last

I was only 22
All undone and overdue
My friends burned all around me
And the smoke was full of you
But let's stop here for a prayer
For what happened there
And let us have a beer
For anyone who's still here

I didn't leave a letter
I just wrote my baby's name
On the mirror all steamed over
With water, heat and shame

All hopes were long-time missing
They'd had enough of me
I found them hanging through the moon
From the Hooker oak tree

The knife was on the basin
Wrapped in my baby's towel
My friend the water let me in
And I lowered myself down

'Cause you can drink and you can shake
And you can dry up bitter tears
But the first to pass right through you
Will age you fifty years
And you could say, 'well I don't know
You got to love just the same'
But I say all I got
Was a phone call that never came

The towel was lying open
And it hurt so bad
There was red smoke in the water
And all the things we'd had

Now honey you don't need this heart
Now that I'm dead and gone
So dig me up and give me back
What I never should've lost

You see I felt a little weak
I closed my eyes and thought of you
As the phone let out a ring",22

The cradle to the angel
I'll be looking over you
Pass me up or lay me down
Once I wanted an explanation
But now I'd settle for just a sound

What's the name they call ones like us:
A bouquet of shadows in the evening sun
I sat up late and watched you sleep
And you said you'd waited thirty years for me

Another painter-over hardwood floor
And off the hallway, dear, another trail of tears
Out past the couple, and onto the street
I emptied my flask out at your feet

Austin are you calling
Atlanta are you there
Eupora are you dreaming
That you saw my darling dear",Cradle to the Angel
Richard Buckner,"I got a drive-away car in Georgia
And baby boy, there's two lines in the road:
One to leave you lonely
And the other to leave me alone
To get down to the easy flow
You've got to cut through the thick brew

Honey, I've shamed your angel name
The drunkest and deepest cut I've made
Oh, my petal in the puddle,
I'm talking about the time I've been long gone
I shot my insides out with grief and Mr. Kessler

All tanked up
And dressed down in desire
And I hope you understand
I'm not your man anymore",Desire

In this bed of roses
Promises of petals, then
You wake up on the other end

Love is such a monster, kid
And power is addictive
Sweet fire and beauty'll turn this city flat
And could you really handle that

I thought I was through with living once
But, lord, the way she lies there breathing
In the deepest hour of the night
Unraveled, opened full and all undone by

And last night we capped the cavern, dear
We said the word and we're goin' down

And you kissed it all through

Is just the prettiest little burden

Richard Buckner,"It?s a bruised and a fallen sky
Pressed all up against us
And it?s just as true, so far away
But I can be there by breakfast

I just drive on through to you
So as the past goes breaking by
Where are you tonight?

It?s 4 AM and I'm awake again
And not quite high enough
I?ll be back, you know when
Should I lie a little and dream away

I'm just lying here anyway
With a chill a little heat
Could kill on sight
But where are you tonight?

Wasted and well spent
Taken and once wrecked
Oh, you're better than this and that
I thought I was cured of any last chance

Unfastened and floored
Now all I want is
Just a little
Nothing more

I looked inside, the ring we wear
And I read myself to sleep
I caught myself, so captured there
Deep inside those cavern eyes

Oh my one, my one
You've broken me
At the vow, below the vine
But where are you tonight?

Where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?
",4AM
Richard Buckner,"Tough is as she does
Won't you slump on over and stir my shuffle down?
For once, devotion is enough
But the walk you whittle, another dream, another drink
Over in the basement, not an inch between
I'm yours and I have to leave

Take care, you throaty fare
A shade away and a braid along
Shy a day or two of what I've done
What I said I wouldn't do
This poured out picker through a cold 750
There's a view I barely see

What if I just showed up tonight
While the crush is crumbling from the tule fog outside
Like the mark your line left without a sound
Let me in and lay me out

Two rooms of yours, one with the runner
And the other with the runaway
And vows abound in infidels
Waved along and swept away
",Ed's Song
Richard Buckner,"Once upon a blue thing or two
Eyes in sight, the moon confused
We heard the sparks fly and we watched their lies
Some died in retreat, some in jealousy

You know boredom breeds, temptation in its wake
But do look at what temptation's done
The spirit is here in the hollow, a message at the bottom of the bottle
Oh, the sky tonight is gray, all the quiver and the quake

Reaching away goodbye rye
Been bled on down the road
But when the buzz was over, man
It was getting cold

The years are slow, so I lye low
Do you want your name to burn away?
Oh, but I decide, honey, will I ride?
Along and through and over you

Sleep shame, Reno's low behind in flames
So with your misty mist and your low land frame
Won't you sleep shame?
",A Goodbye Rye
Richard Buckner,"Underspent
And too young too
I stumbled onto a picture of you
You wild bitter tale
All cherry oak and tears
As the branches looked in
The summer is done
And we are too, dear

And let the silent light in
Soon I'll be on that highway

That takes so many lives
One of them was mine
Hand me that lil wallet picture

Where I'd walk to you at night
Were so blindly lit
Yeah, there were four little flames

And the torch in the attic

And kissed you awake
And as you packed up your load,

Richard Buckner,"Though, I may be miles away from her
With years that pass without a word
I've never seen a moon so high
Her name hangs down from there, tonight

So, put your little hand away
I've seen such needy days before
On nights like this, my hope returns
Though, I may be miles away from her

A locket just for good luck
A pocket knife for long nights
And a sleepy little dreamer
With still, miles to go

27, take me home
And pour that last year down my throat
The days will fade and the nights will burn
Though, I may be miles away from her

I see her in the doorway
Staring a hole through it all
The first of many fits
And the last one was, man, the last one was

So check your lock and close your eyes
When you wake up, I'll be all right
Never tell them where it hurts
And keep your bullet, safe inside

The wind has wept and the sky is slurred
But we slept through the sunrise, too
I'm dreaming still of who you were
Though, I may be miles away from her

And fly back out
And we'll pretend
Forget we're dead

Yeah, we'll lay it down 
When we're all through
When we're killed or cured
And barely heard

Put Ariel on
And smoke away the night
And do the white net crawl
Until the hammers fall

I missed what it meant

With her eyes bowing down and her last light gone
You looked up to her window from the backyard dusk,
Hired as a shot, lingered as a crush.

Stake me when I'm running and I'll stay down.
See, I've only had a photograph to drag around. 
Would you take another trip with a candle like her?
Strike another promise and watch it burn.

Another left the day before.
Time was saved,
But not a thing was changed.

Faded, fond, and tried
Waiting for some rain,
Not a thing would change.

I'll tell ya, while we linger along our years,

I lapped up to the bay bar and I saw her bobbing like a wave and I slowed down.

Just six months this summer since I've known her that she's been away. 
And sometimes I still answer to the gone ghosts that only suckers make. 
Slow down and hold on. Hold on.

Even my heroes are almost gone, almost folding from the flame, 
But how low can your fuse glow and warm you until your torch begins to fade?

I ran down the stairs & onto the street
(Of course, the chase was sheap).
But, here she walks again
On bent-up promises

There's nights I still fall:

I went to Springfield
There I met a lush,
Whose father just deceased left him a fortune
He married me when drunk
My life was wretched
A year passed and one day they found him dead
That made me rich
I moved on to Chicago
After a time met Tyler Rountree, villain
I moved on to New York
A gray-haired magnate
Went mad about me, so another fortune
He died one night right in my arms, you know
(I saw his purple face for years thereafter)
There was almost a scandal

I moved on, 
This time to Paris
I was now a woman,
Insidious, subtle, 
Versed in the world and rich
My sweet apartment near the Champs Elysees
Became a center for all sorts of people,
Musicians, poets, dandies, artists, nobles,
Where we spoke French and German, Italian, English

And dust with my dust,
O, child who died as you entered the world,
Dead with my death!

Not knowing breath, though you tried so hard,
With a heart that beat when you lived with me,
And stopped when you left me for life

It is well, my child
For you never traveled
The long, long way that begins with school days,
When little fingers blur under the tears
That fall on the crooked letters

And the earliest wound, when a little mate
Leaves you alone for another,
And sickness, and the face of fear by the bed,
The death of a father or mother
Or shame for them, 
Or poverty
The maiden sorrow of school days ended
And eyeless nature that makes you drink
From the cup of love, 
Though you know it's poisoned,
To whom would your flower-face have been lifted?
Botanist, weakling? 
Cry of what blood to yours?
Pure or foul, for it makes no matter,
It's blood that calls to our blood
And then your children?
Oh, what might they be?
And what your sorrow? 
Child! Child!
Death is better than life",Elizabeth Childers
Richard Buckner,"Another washout, brake lights showing
Probably gonna slow down, no way of knowing
Let's hear the outline, I see where it's going
I know where it came from, a bubble in the moment

Someone'll find out, finishing the time
Crashing around and one night you'll try it
Is something at stake?

Seen off safely but I could've used
A chance at maybe, a time or two
One for the distance and speaking of the roar
Stopping just to listen at her number on the door

Isn't something calling, coming as you go?
Never and always and missing the throw
With hours on the fade

It wasn't where you found it, returning late again
Waking dressed from before in some week-long bed
Leave it all still made

Fall to a weak floor and let it lay
Think of somebody too far away
Get something easy lost in the fuel
Come back tomorrow with a new excuse

Sparklers are passing to the corners of the night
I feel the heat and they move on glowing
But I can pull away

I'd love to talk to you out side 
In the open air, some where 
To take it, too, and watch it go 
Any where, in here 
You never know

I need the dance to slow, closing up 
And going out, passing 
As the words to come, slipping 
As the nights will do, burning 
As the clouded sun letting nothing through

You see, the walls are gone some times 
There's no other way

Are you warming in the dark?

Richard Buckner,"Another washout, brake lights showing
Probably gonna slow down, no way of knowing
Let's hear the outline, I see where it's going
I know where it came from a bubble in the moment

Someone'll find out
Finishing the time
Crashing around and one night you'll try it
Is something at stake?

Seen off safely but I could've used
A chance at maybe, a time or two
One for the distance and speaking of the roar
Stopping just to listen at her number on the door

Isn't something calling
Coming as you go?
Never and always and missing the throw?
With hours on the fade

It wasn't where you found it
Returning late again
Waking dressed from before in some week long bed
Leave it all still made

Fall to a weak floor and let it lay
Think of somebody, too far away
Get something easy, lost in the fuel?
Come back tomorrow with a new excuse

Sparklers are passing to the corners of the night
I feel the heat and they move on glowing
But I can pull away

I couldn't make it down, cloudy, in the lights
Fading out and, folded in a letter that I found, 
Remembered just in time: forgetting to forgive
Never turning back around, 

Stretching at the seams, pulling back the hood,

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear

They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with the good and the bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who Imagined it all
All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears

You know I've been in love before, that much is true, 
but though I've been in love before it wasn't with you.

Oo, Sandy Could we spend the day together?
You know how rainy weather get me down when I'm alone.
You Sandy, you gotta be a friend today.
An hour with you could chase the winter away.

Your eyes can see clearer than mine.

The time it took surprises me, nothing's the same,
As if my life began again hearing you name.

Is now comin' true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Somethin' in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

Richard Cheese,"I've been caught stealing
Once when I was 5
I enjoy stealing
It's just as simple as that
Well, it's just a simple fact
When I want something,
I don't want to pay for it
I walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right!
If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!
My girl, she's one too
She'll go and get her a shirt
Stick it under her skirt
She grabbed a razor for me
And she did it just like that
When she wants something, she don't want to pay for it
She walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey all right!
If I get by, it's mine
Mine all mine!
We sat around the pile
We sat and laughed
We sat and laughed and waved it into the air!
And we did it just like that
When we want something, we don't want to pay for it
We walk right through the door
Walk right through the door
Hey, all right!
If I get by, it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. . .",Been Caught Stealing

Coolin' by the lockers, gettin' kinda funky
Me and the crew were drinking brass monkey
This girl walked by, she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker and grabbed the Spanish fly
I put it with the monkey, mixed it in the cup
Went over to the girl, ""Yo baby what's up?""
I offered her a sip, the girl she gave me lip
It did begin, the stuff wore in, and now she's on my tip

Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss 
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight 

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential 

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you

Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight 

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around 

Pace yourself from me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now 
When all I wanna do is try

I wish nothing but the best for you both 
An older version of me

Would she go down on you in a theater? 
Does she speak eloquently 
And would she have your baby? 
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother 

1-'Cause the love that you gave that we made 
Wasn't able to make it enough for you 
To be open wide, No 
And every time you speak her name 
Does she know how you told me 
You'd hold me until you died 
Till you died, but you're still alive 

2-And I'm here, to remind you 
Of the mess you left when you went away 
It's not fair, to deny me 
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me 
You, you, you oughta know 

You seem very well, things look peaceful 
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know 
Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity? 
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner 
It was a slap in the face 
How quickly I was replaced 
And are you thinking of me when you f... her?

Ohh... aah... ahh... ahh... 

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed 
That was me and I'm not gonna fade

Down someone else's back I hope you feel it

Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands
This time will be the last
I fear unless I make it all so clear
I need you so

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
And learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in

Baby I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right

I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy 

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind!!!
And I smell like shit 

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Where is my motivation
No time for motivation

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun

At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing 
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them

Richard Cheese,"So you been to school for a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car thinkin' you'll go far
Back east your type don't crawl
Play ethnicky jazz to parade your snazz
On your five grand stereo
Braggin that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul 

It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Richard Clay,"Tus desprecios son (tus desprecios son)
lo que a mi corazón están matando
Y tus desaires son como puñales
que me estás clavando
Y ya no sé qué hacer (y ya no sé qué hacer)
pa recobrar tu amor, y
que me quieras de nuevo
Día tras día, poco a poco,
nuestro amor, por tus desprecios,
se está acabando
Porque te digo aquí, y me dices que allá
Y si yo digo si, me dices que jamás
Y si quiero salir, tú te quieres quedar
No sé por qué razón, tú no me quieres ya
Te digo que te amo, y ya no contestas
Te ofrezco besos, y me sacas vueltas
No te imaginas cuánto me duele
quererte tanto, y tú ya no me quieres",Tus Desprecios
Richard Clayderman,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Richard Clayderman,"No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

Say you love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summertime
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you, here beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime

Richard Clayderman,"All that I know in my life
I have learned on the street
No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet
Will I wake up from this nightmare?
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many

I feel so all alone
We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night
Left by my father with only this scar on my face

Told by my mother that
""No, you were just a mistake""
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
Some have paid to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside
We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
Than this life I know too well
Lord, I know I'm bound for heaven
'Cause I've done my time in hell
We are the children of the night
(We are children of the night)
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night",Do You Know Where You're Going To? (Theme from Mahogany)
Richard Clayderman,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Richard Clayderman,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All
Richard Clayderman,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

'Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

You and me in paradise

You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place

But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face

Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along
It made me smile

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every sha, la, la, la
Every woo, woo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing so fine

When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every sha, la, la, la
Every woo, woo still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
That they're startin' to sing so fine

Come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die

The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

I would, my friend, Fernando

And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes

And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows

Richard Clayderman,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

As a whelp fast to the teat
She smote me then
We've ever since been shadows
Two beasts of one old soul

If you rely on the kindness of strangers
It helps to have a hound for a handmaid
Not only for the superior nose
Or companionship
Often people stop to talk with me
Having never seen before such a very beautiful snow-coloured collie

Working the fell a most powerful eye
Part of the grass, fast as lightning
Before the children were grown
They'd ride her like a pony
Through the nodding banners yesterday
She went in chase of a ship's rat
At my wit's end I finally located her
Under a whining bush, my poor old lady, seized by a fit

When the raiders came in their flaming carriages
She went running to her family
While I listened on, cowering behind a pile of drying logs
There's no denying it

I sold my shoes so I could buy a chicken
A penance and a treat on her final day

Now she is gone I carry her down to the sea
And scream at the sinking stars

Take it off! Take it off! Take it off - the whooping cough
And we'd be your eternal debtors

With a bundle in her arms
It was clutching her tresses and nuzzling her breast
And the colour was returned

I used to hold him in the palm of one hand
Now he's grown as tall as I am
With the face of his mother veiled in downy gold
On the broad shoulders of a man

He is strong with the second sight
In these parts held in some renown
Using words not his own he veraciously foretold
Of a drought when the stream was bulging

When the pictures become too real
He buries his nose in the bush of my beard
And gently pinches my earlobe between thumb and forefinger
Until the present is restored

At the murmur of dawn there's a knock at the door
And a small man standing by
He is wearing a dogshide and flies for a crown
One good eye a sparkling well in his brow
I'd already acquainted myself of that voice
Before he'd even spoke:

""I have come to collect what is rightfully owed
Rouse the boy from slept
Get him bathed and dressed
It is time he kept your end of the bargain""

The bargain",Hob
Richard Dawson,"Fortune wags its tongue
Along the walkways of the bathhouse
They say the monk returned from Iceland
Unearthly boon in stow
He who possesses the Pin of Quib
Is granted eternal beauty

I am tired of men
Of kneading the knots from their bulbous backs and necks
And rinsing their filmy water
From this mew of tiles
When I heard tell of the Pin of Quib
Straight away I knew I had to hold it at all costs

A storm like a drum
Encompasses the priory
As I go on mouse-toes
Into the blind man's chamber

And leaning over his bed
I push the blade between his ribs
But then in a flash he's got my wrists
And he's pinned me to the floor

I wake up gagged and bound
To a windless ochre forest
The monk's wan face inches from my own
His breathe smells like pears

He asked me then
""would you like to see the Pin?""
Retching on his filth
I nod ""more than anything""

From inside his coat
He fishes a broache
A plain pea of stone
No bigger than a thumbnail

And I can hardly believe
How very ordinary it seems
Then it dawns on me
It was all mere folly

""Yes, now you see
The Pin's a pebble only
That which you so thirstily
Coveted over my dead body

Now it is yours to keep
You are it's custodian
But first I must have your eyes
Then the circle will be whole""

Richard Dawson,"In the kingdom of Bryneich
Verging on a muddy crook of Coquet
A dice of houses cast with clay and sheepdung
Through a soup of starlit peatsmoke
Gradually emerges as we descend

""Bring the goose my child!""
I carve a notch into the squirming post
It smells like a smithy
""Hurry now and drink the bowl before it congeals""

There comes frightful news from town
Of great evil abound
The heartbroken potter's idiot boy was snatched from the speltfield
Scouring a fortnight in the hills
All they found, pointing from a sett, a small grey hand

""Tie the goats to my cot
With tansy rags their faces cover
Push straws into the windows
Damp the coals, and bar the door with hornbeam limb""

Blinding colours leap
Along bemirrored tower walls
Stretching as far as the eye can see

I am woke in icy beads
By a clamour coming from the broadbeans
The snapping of stems and a foul-smelling bloom
Paralysed I watch my child's breath
Glide like a jellyfish across the black morning

When the sun is climbing
We'll find the harrow smothered in slime
When the sun is climbing
We'll put it in the dog's noses

We'll hurry down the Valley of Eagles
When the sun is climbing
We'll hear the distance of the North Sea

When the sun is dying
We'll cross the Causeway of No Memory
When the sun is dying
Our trees will billow in dunes

When the sun is dying
We'll wade around the shoreline
When the sun is dying
The algae as a nap of fire

When the sun is dying
Below the surface of the water
When the sun is dying
In the face of the cliff a ghastly doorway

When the sun is dying
We'll pitch a tent of pigskin on the beach

Is there no reason for me to exist
But for as a plaything of miscreants, malingerers, dastards and knaves?

How is it so
A child can be bought for a year's worth of grain?
In this day and age
It's hard to explain but it happens again and again

I'll never forget the scene
Where the freckled jowls contort across my father's 
Face and disappear under thew wheels of the cart

Oh, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh, why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

Now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
It's once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
So why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

And where was the will of my father when
We raised our swords on high?
And where was my mother's wailing when
Our flags were justified?
And where will we take our pleasures when
Our bodies have been denied?

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.



",Children of Darkness
Richard Fleeshman,"These broken strings they won't pull them back again
Caught in the middle with the future, got no plan
Wish I could freeze these moments now to never end
But I just don't know where to start

Stepping up knowing everything will change
We reach out but no one's there to point the way
I'm not the first but not the last but I won't say
I'm not afraid that this might break us but

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

If I miss those sleepless nights that turn to days
If trouble finds me then there's no one I can blame
No regrets we know it's got to be this way
And everything must change but

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

You and I, we're both the same
Try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know that we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again

You and I, oh, we're both the same
We try to get it right, we're just going different ways
And I know, we will laugh at this someday
I wish that we were back here again
I wish that we were back here",Back Here
Richard Fleeshman,"The minute you count it
The way the words just roll off your tongue
The breaking, the promise
The afterglow of a kiss in the sun

You could have warned me
You'd be laughing when I let you see it all
I was hanging by a thread
And you were there to watch me fall
And now I'm left asking why

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
And everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon
'Cause it?s all coming down after you

The moment you stole it and sold it
But the madness still lives in my head
Did I just imagine
The truth in all of the lies that you said?

You didn't bother to explain
I never had a fighting chance
I'm a poet and fighter
Now my head is in my hands
And now I'm left asking why

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
And everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon
'Cause it?s all coming down after you

Lying in lies, put the clouds in my pocket
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
And I'm out of my mind

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
Everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon
'Cause it?s all coming down after you

It?s coming down like chocolate stars in the sun
And everything we had is gone
Don't waste your time, boy
Don't waste it shouting at the moon
'Cause it?s all coming down after you
'Cause it?s all coming down after you

Richard Fleeshman,"I wanna drive up to my old house driveway
Take a walk around my old bedroom
Let the laughter and the memories surround me
I wonder if they love it like I used to

Do, do, do, do, do
Where did the time go?
Do, do, do,do, do
The little boy in the photos

Why can't it all just be like yesterday
I'd be a lifetime away from 18
Just sat by a window, playing songs on the radio
Where did that time go?
Won't someone tell me?

It's like my childhood just ran out my last birthday
Now I've got all these responsibilities
I'm still young but I'm old enough to know that
I'm still meeting the man that's turning into me

Do, do, do, do, do
Where did the time go?
Do, do, do,do, do
The little boy in the photos

Why can't it all just be like yesterday
I'd be a lifetime away from 18
Just sat by a window, playing songs on the radio
Where did that time go?
Won't someone tell me?

won't someone tell me?

And now the neon London lights, they all surround me
Busy streets full of faces I don't know
Wanna tear the hands on the clock and turn them backwards
Go to familiar places I call home

Do, do, do, do, do
Where did the time go?
Do, do, do,do, do
The little boy in the photos

Why can't it all just be like yesterday
I'd be a lifetime away from 18

Richard Fleeshman,"Disconnected from what we are
I tried to reach you, get back to the start
Why can't we love
Just because I think your funny
Even though nobody does

Did we start a fire just to watch it burn?
Did I push too hard and think you'd never learn?

Is everything going backwards?
Is mercury in retrograde?
I thought I knew what love was
Now tomorrow is yesterday
Is everything going backwards

Freeze the picture, stop the sun
Go underground, forget what we've done
I can't cut the chord, I'm not like you
I don't want something that means nothing to you

Did we start a fire just to watch it burn?
Did I push too hard and think you'd never learn?

Is everything going backwards?
Is mercury in retrograde?
I thought I knew what love was
Now tomorrow is yesterday
Is everything going backwards

Every word to you say but I know you never felt
Do you want somebody else, somebody else?

Is everything going backwards?
Is mercury in retrograde?
I thought I knew what love was
Now tomorrow is yesterday
Is everything going backwards
",Going Backwards
Richard Fleeshman,"Tell me, do you think it'd be alright
If I could just crash here tonight?
As you see I'm in no shape for drivin'
And I got no place to go

And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I ever had
I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might
Be found to take it's place

Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy

You can trust me not to drink
And not to sleep around
And if you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down

'Cause all I really want is to be with you
And feel like I matter too
If I didn't blow the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might
Be found to take it's place

Hey jealousy

Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might
Be found to take it's place

Listen to my heart
There's only one thing I can start

Richard Fleeshman,"He takes directions from the way the wind blows
He's attracted by the way that she steps on
He keeps looking and she knows

Never used to get the 7.30
He's got a job and has to be in early, oh
But suddenly there's this girl and he thinks

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you, oh

Makes a letter from a piece of paper
Asking whether she would meet him later on
He'd be a fool to let this go

He folds it up, it goes back in his pocket
He wished he had it but he hasn't got it, no
He?ll never know if she thinks

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you

All over the world there's people
So close to meeting people
But don't have the nerve to risk a no
So they sleep alone

Oh I'll never ever have anyone to hold them close
They let it go
But I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you

Hold me close
And I?ll never ever think about letting you go
Hold me close
'Cause I never ever wanna be without you
Never ever wanna be without you
",Hold Me Close
Richard Fleeshman,"I was dry as a desert plain
She came down like a summer rain
Then came a hurricane

It was too intoxicating
Feeling the pressure pushing down on me
Fighting the gravity

And now I, I don't wanna stay, don't wanna go
I don't want fast, don't want slow
I don't want high, don't want a low
Just wanna play it down the middle this time

Play it down the middle this time
Play it down the middle this time
I don't want two extremes, just in-betweens
I wanna play it down the middle this time

I'm just a shadow of myself
A plain old reflection of who I used to be
It's staring back at me

Like a sun and a moon in the same sky
I stood in a crowd and I feel like I'm all alone
From color to monochrome

And now I, I don't wanna stay, don't wanna go
I don't want fast, don't want slow
I don't want high, don't want a low
Just wanna play it down the middle this time

Play it down the middle this time
Play it down the middle this time
I don't want two extremes, just in-betweens
I wanna play it down the middle this time

don't want maybe or someday, baby
I don't want maybe, I need to know right now

And now I don't wanna stay, don't wanna go
I don't want fast, don't want slow
I don't want high

Play it down the middle this time
I don't want two extremes, just in-betweens
I wanna play it down the middle this time

Richard Fleeshman,"I was blind, I should've known what was coming
I'd always escaped it before
I fell in the swell of affection
But I don't wanna sink anymore

You're burning me down like fire
The rope getting tighter each breathe that I take
Watching the days getting longer
Wasting away

Now I'm fighting, oh, a feeling
That is twisting on the inside
I tried running, tried resisting
But it's got a hold on me this time

If I don't stand a chance then let me down easy
I don't wanna fall from this high
These days are the days
I was always afraid would arrive

Oh 'cause I, I've had my share of temptation
But always left love to one side
Never was part of the picture
Well that's why it's hurting to hide

My secret dependence upon you
If you would have know where to look on my face
I couldn't get out if I had to
I'm ? this place and

Now I'm fighting, oh, a feeling
That is twisting on the inside
I tried running, tried resisting
But it's got a hold on me this time

If I don't stand a chance then let me down easy
I don't wanna fall from this high
These days are the days
I was always afraid would arrive

Oh, not sure if it's pleasure or pain
This changing emotion I'm in
Yeah, into the unknown I'm heading
Sent away

'Cause I'm fighting, oh, a feeling
That is twisting on the inside
I tried running, tried resisting
But it's got a hold on me this time

Richard Fleeshman,"I picked up your shirts this morning
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
Mr Reynolds said to say hello
I started to cry, I started to cry
Every place we ever walked and
Everywhere we talked, I miss you
You never leave my mind
So much of you is left behind

You took my days with you
Took my nights with you

Those unfinished conversations
We used to have still speak to me
And I write you letters every day
That I’ll never send and you’ll never see
All this wishful thinking
Gets me nowhere I can’t stay
Though my heart is broken
It keeps breaking every day

You took my hopes with you
Took my dreams with you

I keep thinking that you’ll be calling
Everyone says that it’s all in my head
And I can’t accept it yet
I’m not ready to just give in
I know that I can’t live in this pain
With these feelings of regret
I can’t comprehend this
And pretend that I don’t care
Any place I wanna be
I wanna see you there

You took my life with you
Took my world with you",With You
Richard Franklin,"It's late and taillights fade
I sway, as I clean up the place
It's been a while since they all came around
It's been a while since I mellowed out
Janie asks why I'm still alone
Suggesting it might be time to move on
Rather wait cause nothing compares
Found a way to keep you near
I'll be up all night
Dancing with you by the pale moonlight
I'll be up all night
And I hope you're too
Suddenly, you appear to me
In that velvet dress that you bought last year
I won't ever understand why you're here
If you can't come back
I'll be up all night
Dancing with you by the pale moonlight
I'll be up all night
And I hope you're too
I'll be up all night

Richard Friedman,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours,

I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream,

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Richard Harris,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron

All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh no!

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh, after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you

She'll make you players in the bright merry morning
She'll run and hide and leave you the paper
Promises behind her as she runs across the square

You can't win the race, she will set the pace
You'll hear her laughing just behind the foolish fences
Throw back the gate and find the piece of paper
Lying on the curbstone but the lady won't be there

And later in the day, you will be searching for a way
To let her know, you're ready for her little game to end
'Cause it's getting dark and then

You'll see her face, a glimpse of lace
And you'll go running through the last sweet dying day dreams
Calling her name but she's been home an hour
Laughing at the mirror and she combs her paper hair

Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide
From side to side

A pleasant walk

Would be a sheer delight

Yes, should we get hungry on the way
We'll stop and, uh, have a bite

But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her heavy head
She knew too well this was no time
To leave her Oyster bed

The sea is nice
Take my advice
And stay right here

I'll declare my intent to race again
Baby I've done running
I've cut myself a deal
Gave myself a ladder, this time for real
And I've got nothing on the inside left to charm, just look at me
And I've got nothing to live up to and nothing to reveal
Go on run for me
Go on run for me
Go on run for me because I can't take it back
Gone the summer gone the past and now it's done
Now it's done

My road is paved with fear
I bathed myself in sweet grass to tame the years

There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees

She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones

The signals out to the men
Did they make it on board
With fire and the sword?

But the call of the ocean
Is so hard to ignore
It's why I'm leaving your door

When the wind howls and the ghosts wail
Dead men they don't bite
Their faces haunt me at night

Ah honey I've got to go
Can you hear the waves roar?
And no sound of the shore
It shakes you spirit and your soul

I dream of sailing the oceans
In a galleon all golden
Dead trees in the hearth
The way they burn it warms the heart
Ah honey, I've got to go

The years passed
We traveled and sailed west
I'll buy you a new dress
With all of my gold
Free your spirit and your soul

On our way, to the fields where we will play today. 
Louis brings his kite, 
With a homemade paper-chain. 
Strange to see the sight, 
Of the moon, in the daytime not the night. 
I will lift you up, 
So high, on my shoulders to the sky. 
Ah

Don't stare at the sun too long.
Don't stare at the sun too long.
Singing in the dark, 
On our way home, the day is done for sleepy ones. 
On the fire escape, 
My telescope, that scans the evening sky. 
If I could see it all, 
All to be lost, in the galaxy of distant stars. 
Did I see your face? 
It weighs so much, to be alone tonight. 
Ah

Don't stare at the sun too long. 
Don't stare at the sun too long. 
You scare everyone, 
If you stare at the sun.

They think cars everything
To kiss your kind, apple cheeks
Stolen love under a canopy of trees
Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down
Come back feeling good.
There must be a place for us
For you and I to be as one
Around your shoulders, around your hair
My eyes were blinded by solar flares
Won't you follow me down,
Down into the woods.
Won't you follow me down,
Come back feeling good.
Come back feeling good.

Eat me and you shall hold

Around your shoulders, in your hair

These seismic moments rare and few
Does this seismic kiss from you
Take all that's bitter, all that's cold
Does the shadow in me show?
Wisen up, she can see, eat me whole and lose your hope
For the days, these woods are sold
I would like you to know
I love you
I love you

Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down

You said that I would meet somebody with green eyes
Yours are blue!

If you seek it, you won't find
The lovers' eyes so blinded by love
Blinded by love, blinded by love

Time ticks away
Over the hills there is a valley
In the valley there's a little tiny house unoccupied

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

As simple as a man could ever be
And he was happy as a king

He had a clock that worked all right
It worked all right, but not exactly quite
Instead of going: ""tick, tock, tick""
The crazy clock went: ""tock, tick, tock""

The poor old man just raved and raved
Because nobody could say
Why his silly clock behaved that hickory dickory way

But now a famous man is he
He owns a public curiosity
From far and wide, the people flock 
To hear the syncopated clock

But none of them could solve the mystery
They called Professor Einstein too

Richard Hayman,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Richard Hayman,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront
Richard Hayman,"Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut  
Hurry up now
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand

Richard Hayman,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet your my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Richard Hayman,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty

With eyes of their own to see with

My every kiss with theirs

Time and time again I just made things worse
It seems you see the most of what is really true when
You're stepping into your hearse

Only time can write a song that's really really real
The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels
And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals

And when I want to write a song that says it all at once
Like time sublimely silences the whys
I know that if I try I'm going to take a fall at once
And splatter there between my lies

Only time can write a song that's really really real
The most a man can do is say the way its playing feels
And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals

We are made of it and if we give submission
Among our chances there's a chance we can choose
And if we take it, by uncertainty's permission
Then it's impossible to lose

And know he only knows as much as time to him reveals",Time

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Asleep on the hay

Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

And it left us off here at these questions today

Was it really only movies?

Richard Julian,"I used to work in an ice cream shop,
Sugar cone with a cherry on top.
This girl, she had a pretty face,
I think her mother might've owned the place.
I still think about her sometimes, no reason at all.

I took a trip in a Buick once,
Stayed out West for a couple of months.
The apples and the oranges there,
They shine a lot better than they shine here,
Other than that, things turned out the same.

Oh no, we got bills to pay.
Oh no, we got errands to run.
Oh no, too many things to do.
And I'm not gonna do a damn one.

You see, I'm working off this leftover buzz,
Morning after a part of it was,
By all accounts a great success.
I have many friends and acquaintances,
Thing is, I've never been good with names.

Oh no, we got bills to pay.
Oh no, too many errands to run.
Oh no, too many bills to pay,
And I can't pay a damn one.

Oh, but I know I'm gonna make a lot of money one day,
I got this hunch that it's on the way.
I'm gonna stack it up on my living room floor,
Dig me a trench by the living room door.

Richard Julian,"She's drunk enough when she is sober
She don't need no alcohol
Don't need no artificial means
No amphetamines to cause her to fall

She's like the rain in the middle of sunlight
Leaves you confused, but still reborn
I've been up all night, havin' a ball
Starin' at the view of my brick wall in slow New York

I heard that creaking in the hallway
I wiped my eyes and turned on the light
I took some medicine from the shelf
Just a bad influence on myself when you're out of sight

I thought she asked me for the world once
All she wanted was some comfort and nothing more
But like the morning's on Monday, these things are colored grey in slow New York

And if you come back to me now
We'll go by the Sunday times, a little salt, a couple limes to beat the heat
You're gonna swear I make 'em better
Than the Mexicans on Rivington Street

Took the latch off of the front gate
I hid the key up over the door

I'm still on the same side of the bed in slow New York

Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window

Looking in their eyes
I see a memory

And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing

And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy
