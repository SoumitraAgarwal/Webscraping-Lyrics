Stonewall Jackson,"I'm always second choice I'm never first with you
Oh how it hurts to see you out with someone new
But I'll wait around while you play around and have your fun
Maybe someday you'll make second choice your one and only one

Just when I think I'm number one I find I'm number two
I feel the pain and hide the hurt that I go through
I live on dreams my precious dreams that never will come true
How long will I be second choice and love you like I do

Though second choice is hard to take I'll never change sweetheart
I'll always be around to play the loser's part
I'll swallow pride and lock inside the heartaches that I feel
How long will I be second choice with the love so real
I'm always second choice...",Second Choice
Stonewall Jackson,"I met you and we married we planned our future well
Built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekend parties that never seemed to end
Then came the heartache brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame and while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
[ ac.guitar ]
First came the weekend parties...




",Sorrow's Tearing Down the House
Stonewall Jackson,"Your secret love has known to everybody in this town
No need to try you can't deny the talk that's going round
You'll meet in secret places when you think no one's around
People calling you the sweetheart of the town
Would you rather have the name sweetheart instead of wife
Oh why not be content to tread the wrong way for the right
The kind of life you're living now I just can't stay around
While they're calling you the sweetheart of the town
[ piano ]
Infatuation's not the kind of love that we once knew
But that's the kind you hope for him the kind he's giving you
I'm like a ballhead on a string that you can pull around
While they're calling you the sweetheart of the town
Would you rather have...
While they're calling you the sweetheart of the town




",Sweetheart of the Town
Stonewall Jackson,"You can see the ad in the morning paper this house for sale the owener's leaving town
He won't need it any longer he'll like the price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
She was all I had all I ever wanted but now she's gone so I can't stay in town
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
This happy couple used to live there until the winds of sorrow left it alone and bare
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
For the big house on the corner where love used to live




",Big House on the Corner
Stonewall Jackson,"No one will ever know my heart is breaking although a million teardrops start to flow
I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling I'll miss you but no one will ever know
I'll tell them we grew tired of each other and realized our dreams could never be
I'll even make believe I never loved you then no one will ever know the truth from me

No one will ever know how much I'm pining
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding you've hurt me but no one will ever know

I'll tell them I've found true love with another
That I was glad the day you set me free
I'll even make believe I never loved you then no one will ever know the truth from me",No One Will Ever Know
Stonewall Jackson,"The crest of the waves break over my head
My strength's about gone and soon I'll be dead
I'd rather be dead out here in the sea than to love a woman who never loved me
Oh the water's so cold out here in the dark

The water's so cold as cold as your heart
The lights from the shore are fast growing dim the water's so cold I can hardly swim
I offered my ring I offered my name she said you're a child she put me to shame
If she saw me now she'd have to agree most men couldn't swim this far out to sea

Oh the water's so cold...
The water's so cold I can hardly swim",Water's So Cold
Stonewall Jackson,"The sun goes down and the lights turn on to the gay white way you'll soon be gone
Where the music is sweet and the lights are dim
You have left me and gone like the wild wild wind
You'll never be mine for you're always wrong to you the wild wind will always be home

Oh if I were free like once I have been I'd leave you and gone like the wild wild wind
You're gone and I'm lonely I'll always be glad the taste of your love my lips once had
I know that I'll never be the same again since my lips were kissed by the wild wild wind",Wild Wild Wind
Stonewall Jackson,"I've got to change and to stop my running round
She tried so hard to build me up now I'm on my way down
She tried to keep me happy all I've cost her was pain
Before all her love has gone I've got to change

Oh how could I blame her if she too should run around
At times that she needs me most I'm in some other town
She don't deserve the way I treat her and I feel so ashamed
Before all her love has gone I've got to change

Oh how could I blame her...
Before all her love has gone I've got to change",I've Got to Change
Stonewall Jackson,"It's not me that you speak to when you're talking in your sleep
It's not me I can tell by all the secrets that you keep
It's not me you're always dreaming of oh how it hurts to know which your new love

It's not me that you're kissing someone else is on your mind
It's not me that you're missing cause I'm with you all the time
It's not me and it tears my soul apart to have you hold me while he is in your heart

(It's not me you're pretending when you say that I love you
It's not me I can tell by all the little things you do)
You're in love and any fool can see your heart is breaking for someone it's not me
Your heart is breaking for someone it's not me",It's Not Me
Stonewall Jackson,"I called the old crowd over as soon as you were gone
My first night here without you couldn't stand to be alone
Their jokes're not really funny but their laughing just the same
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came

I'll be all right as long as I'll keep laughing I'll be all right until this party ends
But when the jokes have all been told and the drinks no longer flows
They'll all go home and I won't smile till they come back again
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came

I guess your friends will tell you how I lived here up tonight
You'll think that I don't miss you you'll be far from being right

They can't help me to forget you but their trying just the same
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came
They're not my kind of people but I'm so glad they came",Not My Kind of People
Stonewall Jackson,"Month after month I have ridden this so best oh how tired and weary I have been
When I get home well it still be the same with us
You saw me off but will you see me in
When we get to the station will you be standing there
To put your arms around me once again
I know you've got my letters I've thought that you still care
You saw me off but will you see me in
My lonesome heart keeps saying just don't worry
You've missed me just as much as I've missed you
It won't be long but I'm in such a hurry
If you're not there I'll just be passing through
Yes mile after mile I have ridden this old bus oh how tired and weary I have been
When I get home well it still be the same with us
You saw me off but will you see me in you saw me off but will you see me in",You Saw Me Off
Stonewall Jackson,"Ten dollars for my wedding band that's all the man would pay
But then I slipped it from my hand I pawned my past today
Not long ago we said goobye and went our separate ways
Ten dollars for a love gone by I pawned my past today

With this ring goes memories of happy yesterdays
So if I cry excuse me please I pawned my past today
To me true love is life itself guess I'll just waste away
No love no life there's nothing left I pawned my past today",I Pawned My Past Today
Stonewall Jackson,"You're gonna break my heart beyond repair
But I guess that you wouldn't care
You should wear a sign that's painted bright
The kind that glows in the night

Touch me not I'll bring you pain
Touch me and you'll never be the same

You were anything you seemed to be
But to win your love was my destiny
You're like an ornament that decorates the world
So show a sign you're not like other girls

Touch me not I'll bring you pain
Touch me and you'll never be the same

I've already paid the price for you
So why make another pay it too
Someone will fall just like I did before
If you don't show a sign of what's in store

Touch me not I'll bring you pain
Touch me and you'll never be the same
Touch me and you'll never be the same



",Touch Me Not
Stonewall Jackson,"I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But dear, I hope you're happy just the same

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing now for you and me
And down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought someday I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I can hear the children laughing now with glee
I walk alone and hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
While the organ plays I'll love you truly
Please let me pretend that I was there

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But the wedding bells will never ring for me
",Wedding Bells
Stonewall Jackson,"I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
I'm a goin' lookin' in the night time I'm gonna find you
Any time will be the right time I'm gonna find you
I'm a gonna lookin' in the mornin' baby I'm givin' you a warnin'
'Cause I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you

I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do

If you think as free as big blue hound (it's gotta be me just a trackin' you down)
I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
I'll keep a searchin' for your sweet face I'm gonna find

Here on earth or in out of space I'm gonna find you

Stonewall Jackson,"In a war torn land of poverty somewhere across the sea
There's a little guy who's waiting and he looks a lot like me
His hair is like the raven or the wings of a crow
I don't know what they named him but I'm sure they called him Joe

Just a little guy called Joe like so many more I know
Left all alone somewhere across the sea
I want him to have my name little Joe is mine to claim
This little guy called Joe belongs to me

His mother died to give him life the night my orders came
I wanted to be with them but war's an evil thing
Now he won't recognize me but I've got to let him know
He means much more to someone than just a little guy called Joe
Just a little guy called Joe...",Little Guy Called Joe
Stonewall Jackson,"Yes I gather up the pieces of my heart dear I'm a wondering if I'll ever love again
Just because I lost my head and fell for you dear
I'm afraid your love would struck me down again
So don't take my kind of chances while you're searching

For the love that you believe is true
For that mis'ry known as hearetache may be lurking
In his heart to lay by and torture you

Maybe someday you can find the love you've longed for
If you do then I'll be happy as can be
But I'm still wondering just what you led me on for
When you made me believe that it was me
Don't be breaking other hearts...",Misery Known as Heartache
Stonewall Jackson,"Oh I just return from a wedding a wedding that never should be
Although she has married another in her heart offered vows were to me
I could tell that her poor heart was breaking as she promised to love and obey
When her eyes turned to me it was so plain to see
There were tears on her bridal bouquet
[ piano - steel ]
If I had it all to live over if there was some way to atone
But I know it's too late to regret now for another has made her his own
So I'll take all the blame it was my fault yes the two hearts were broken today
Though she tried hard this time as she walk down the isle
There were tears on her bridal bouquet



",Tears on Her Bridal Bouquet
Stonewall Jackson,"Help help help stamp out loneliness bring back the happy that we had before
Let's all get together tonight and begin by lining the ladies up next to the men
Then two by two let's march day and night
Till loneliness leaves us and goes out of sight

Stonewall Jackson,"An acre of diamonds I'd offered to you a solid gold mansion an airplane or two
This world would be yours dear to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the treasures my pockets to hold
I'd be oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
[ steel - guitar ]
The tears that you've caused me won't buy you one thing
The heartaches you've brought me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted my God have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold




",If Teardrops Were Pennies
Stonewall Jackson,"I made myself a promise I knew I couldn't keep
I promised me I wouldn't cry tonight before I sleep
But to think of how you've hurt me and it's more than I can take
Now I know that promises and hearts were made to break and break and break
Oh promises and hearts were made to break
Promises and hearts were made to be broken
But surely not mine at least I was a hopin'
But a hurtin' heart is something I can't learn to face
Now I see that promises and hearts were made to break and break and break
Oh promises and hearts were made to break
[ ac.guitar ]
I promised all of my neighbors no more crying late at night
I promised them I'd go to sleep things are gonna be alright

Now they know that promises and hearts were made to break and break and break
Oh promises and hearts were made to break",Promises and Hearts
Stonewall Jackson,"If anyone could find the joy that true love brings a girl and boy
We could we could you and I
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay
We could we could you and I

When you're in my arms I know you're happy to be there
And just as long as I'm with you I'm happy anywhere
If anyone could ever say that their true love was here to stay

Stonewall Jackson,"All the days of my youth I remember so well I lived in a world on my own
Nobody cared where my money came from when I had it I wasn't alone
Oh the wine flowed freely and friendship was mine how they all loved me back then
But here in this prison I sit all alone and now where are all of my friends
[ guitar ]
So drink and be marry if this is your wish of wastin' your life out in sin
But remember someday you may be as I am with nothing not even a friend
Oh the wine flowed freely...

",Wine Flowed Freely
Stonewall Jackson,"My show signs on the air at six and I get off at night
But I sit there each evening with more than records on my mind
You know that there's three hours when you're sure that you're free
You only need your radio and you can check on me
You can check on me fourteen thirty on your dial
No matter where you park with him I'm there to make you smile
You smile because you realize these records I might be
You can check on me and know how long it's safe to cheat
[ steel ]
I called your name and played our song so often on the air
I play each request for you and someone else to hear
Out there somewhere you'll hear these words and know I've seen the light
I'll be at home when you come in I take the show tonight




",You Can Check on Me
Stonewall Jackson,"Gonna find me a bluebird let him sing me a song
'Cause my heart's been broken much too long

Then came the time my life was haunted my love unwanted all for you

Stonewall Jackson,"Once I lived a life of wine and roses I drank a lot back then so one concern
Success for me lay just around the corner
I thought my social friends could help me make me turn
But now I'm paying for the days of wine and roses a victim of the drunken life I chose
Now all my social friends look down their noses
'Cause I kept the wine and threw away the rose

I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me
The turn I made was not the turn I'd planned
I watched my social standings slip away from me
Yes I watched the bottle slowly take command
Oh now I'm paying for the days...
Yes I kept the wine and threw away the rose",I Threw Away the Rose
Stonewall Jackson,"I sat there with my teardrops showing just the way I felt
Looking at the emptiness the one I love had left
My little boy said daddy mama's left us all alone
I'll go get the tool box and you can fix our broken home

You can fix our broken home daddy I just know you can
I watched you fix my wagon and now the wheels are tight again
Things will turn out alright daddy don't you cry cause mama's gone
I'll go get the tool box and you can fix our broken home

You should have heard my tiny boy for courage in this man
The courage to repair our shattered world now right again
Thanks to him I found her his words pushed me along
I'll go get the tool box and you can fix our broken home
You can fix our broken home...",I'll Go Get the Tool Box
Stonewall Jackson,"If this house could talk oh what a story although it's only made of wood and stone
How it could brag about its days of glory when it almost became a happy home
I just came back in town to sign the papers the house is sold now it's no longer mine
And since the place I built for you once meant so much to me

Thought I'd drop by and see it one more time
I parked the car got out and looked it over
The unkept lawn now seemed so strange to me
That rambling rose that I'd set out with tender care had died

And weeds grow now where flowers used to be
I walked up close looked through the picture window
The past was oh so clear as I looked through
I listened close and almost heard those tender words of love

As I sat by the fireside with you
If this house could talk...",If This House Could Talk
Stonewall Jackson,"If you hear some footsteps walking close behind you in the night
And you look around and no one do you see
If you feel someone is watching you and there's no one in sight
Have no fear it's only lonely me

It's only lonely me I want you back again
So I'll send my memory to haunt you now and then
It follows you around wherever you may be
The ghost of love that's gone it's only lonely me

If sometimes you have the feeling there is something you forgot
Though you try you can't remember what it was
That's my memory only trying to remind you like as not

It was me that you forgot to love

Stonewall Jackson,"It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine
And every day's the same since I met you
It's such a pretty world today knowing that you're mine
My happiness is being close to you

And though the rains may fall skies will all be blue
And if I look close enough the sun will come shining through
It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine
Today and every day since I met you

And though the rains may fall...
Today and every day since I found you",It's Such a Pretty World Today
Stonewall Jackson,"I don't like the sunshine I don't see the stars
I just hate the moonbeams that's shining where you are
I don't like the places where we walked arm in arm
This world holds nothing since you're gone

I don't see the robins nor hear the bluebirds sing
The winter could be summer and autumn might be spring
I don't know or care for friends we've known so long
This world holds nothing since you're gone
I know I'm bound to meet you upon the street some day
And you'll be with your new love and I'll have to turn away
Oh how I'll dread that moment because I can't stand the pain
To see two hearts just passing that'll never love again
I don't like the sunshine
This world holds nothing since you're gone",This World Holds Nothing
Stonewall Jackson,"I won't be home anymore I'll be so far away
In my lonely prison cell until my dying day
Friend I don't want to bore ye or waste much of your day
But I've got a sad story I'd like to tell about the life that just wasted away
I had a good home and a family one time and riches of diamonds and jewels
But one night out on a party my friends I broke one of God's golden rules
Thy shall not kill was deep in my heart that day
But drinking too much driving too fast I took three lives away
So then I was trialed and convicted and the judge said so mercy on me
He said we was makin' an example so I was sent in this penitentary
Ninety-mine years was my sentence never no more will I roam
Nover to be with my loved ones so dear no place but this cell to call home
I'm alone in my shame and this is written deep in my soul
For the price I must pay for driking and driving can't be paid in silver and gold
I can't see my little darling or watch my babies at play
Three lives I took while drinking and driving out on the highway one day




",Drinking and Driving
Stonewall Jackson,"You've heard songs about the broken hearted couple who have fought
You've heard songs about romances and the teardrops they have brought
Many hearts are broken when the one day love has gone
If you feel the way I'm feeling would you listen to my song

When she walked along beside me and my heart was light and gay
I can see the tune's a changing lonely chords are here to stay
She filled my life with happy now the happiness is gone
Oh I'll try to soothe my sorrow in the verses of my song

My heart's been broken not in two but in ten thousand ways
My nights are filled with loneliness and sadness through the days
I sit here by myself and cry and cry and cry and cry
Oh I guess I'll go on living cause I feel too blue tonight
She filled my life...",My Song
Stonewall Jackson,"I've tried everything that I could think of
Went out and bought some things I've wanted to
Spent money for a while like it's going out of style
Nothing takes the place of loving you
I looked for consolation in the barrooms like too many broken hearted do
I drank a full grop down but every night I found
Nothing takes the place of loving you
Nothing takes the place of holding your soft hands in mine
Empty glasses only leave me blue
Where your sweet lips used to be there's just a taste of wine
And nothing takes the place of loving you
[ piano ]
I thought that I could find someone to help me
Now I can't find the girls I've run through
But after every fling I find the same old thing nothing takes the place of loving you
Nothing takes the place of holding...
Nothing takes the place of loving you




",Nothing Takes the Place of Loving You
Stonewall Jackson,"When she left me all she left me was lonely
She took everything that mean anything to me
As times go by times go by for me so slowly but the past is all the future I see
And the more I think of her the more I think of her love

And I believe I make believe she still loves me
For each day I find each day that she's still on my mind
And the past is all the future I see

The stars I see I can see don't shine so brightly
If there's sunshine it never shines for me
And blue skies only leave me blue and lonely and the past is all the future I see
And the past is all the future I see
And the more I think...
Yes the past is all the future I see",Past Is All the Future I See
Stonewall Jackson,"I'm not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray
To the warden of a penitentiary
I'm not in your town to stay and I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail

Yes warden you know I want my baby out of jail
I've tried to raise baby right I prayed both day and night
That he'd never follow footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide I had feared that he had died

So it's good to find my baby here in jail
Yes warden I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
It's been ten long years today since my husband passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white

I made a vow to keep his chain his gold watch and diamond ring
Oh the county laid my husband in the ground
Yes warden the county laid my husband in the ground

I will pawn to you his watch I will pawn to you his chain
I will pawn to you my husband's diamond ring
I will wash all your clothes or I'll scrub all your floors

If that would get my baby out of jail
Yes warden you know I want my baby out of jail
Then we heard the warden say to this lady so old and gray
I will bring your darling boy to your side

Two iron gates swung wide apart she held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling in the arms of her baby boy she died",I'm Just Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail
Stonewall Jackson,"From this valley they say you are leavin' oh I'll miss your blue eyes and sweet smile
And I know you'll be takin' the sunshine that has lightened our path for a while
Come and sit by my side till you're leavin' do not hasten to bid me adieu
And remember the Red River Valley and the cowboy that loved you so true

When you think of the love that you're leavin' and the words that I never could say

Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

That last long day she said goodbye
Well lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'

Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daaddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to you somehow
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me

Lord I tried and tried, to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

Well Lord I thought I would cry

As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love to give you a heart true and real

You'll walk the floor the way I do your cheatin' heart will tell on you

Stonewall Jackson,"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Faithful till death said our loving Master a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will them seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates",Farther Along
Stonewall Jackson,"Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll reseive such peace and happiness
But wait a little longer please Jesus there are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer please Jesus, a few more days to get our loved ones in
Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost dear ol' Lord, then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say
We may look into the skies and the tears will fill our eyes
For our burdened heart grows heavier with each day
First we cry, oh Lord please come, come and take your children home
But then we look around us and say",Wait a Little Longer Please Jesus
Stonewall Jackson,"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer

If we have don't be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer",What a Friend We Have in Jesus
Stonewall Jackson,"Living below in this old sinful world hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations far where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end where could I go but to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so dear comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face those chilling hands of death where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go

Neighbors are kind I love them everyone comfort I get from God's own words
But when my soul needs 'em from up above where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go",Where Could I Go But to the Lord
Stonewall Jackson,"It hurts down deep when angry words are spoken
Because of this countless tears are shed
Much too often tender hearts are broken
When hasty thoughtless angry words are said
As you know I stormed out of the house again this mornin'
I slammed the door and didn't even take your usual kiss
Well angry words can make us do things without a warnin'
I could hardly wait to get back home to tell you this
First of all you're the reason for my living
You've stuck with me when things were at their worst
We've got the home the kids and the joy they're giving
But over all you always will come first
We found out a long ago this life's no paradise
We're not angels or else we'd all have wings
Above all angry words I hope you realize that I love you if that means anything




",Angry Words
Stonewall Jackson,"I don't know why I drink so much can't even stand the test
But liquid courage helps me through my day
If I take time to stop and think the booze just goes to waste
I'm still the same cause I was born that way
My love walked out and mama cried I've heard she even cursed
And said I'm turning off my family grey
Of all the kids she raised no doubt Stonewall turned out the worse
Guess I must have just been born that way
I guess there's a streak of sorry burried in each man
And it always shows up now and then
Mine wasn't burried deep enough it's got the upper hand
Cause that line between the good and bad's so thin
The preacher said my only chance was to be born again
So I got bowties and tried so hard to break
But the devil in me laughed and danced when I went back to sin
Guess I must have just been born that way
I'm just no good cause I was born that way what can I do when I was born that way

Stonewall Jackson,"I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said I'll sure surprise my wife
I don't think I'll phone I'll just head on home

I passed a little winestore on the corner I pictured big champagne by candle light
I stopped the car right then got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter

He said I'll take two bottles of your best
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winkled as if to say you know the rest
I left the store two steps behind the stranger

From there to my house his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't till he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block till I was dizzy

Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Lord you should've seen their frantic faces

They screamed and cried please put away that knife
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in this cell

Stonewall Jackson,"A story 'bout a pal of mine
Who worked down near the Georgia Line
He's a D.J. in a little country station
Everybody loved him dear
'Cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late
And his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive
She warned against his loss of sleep
And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom sits by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright
Then she'd say a little prayer
Keep him safe for he was there
And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn
All four tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time
B.J. had a lot of nerve
But he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio
The voice she heard she didn't know
B.J.'d never been this late before
But with the road so bad and all
She'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

B.J. the D.J. only twenty-four
A wreck at ninety miles an hour
He'll spin the discs no more

And reads, without his heart

You want everything 
But you can't see the signs""

Somewhere, you'll take my hand 
Somewhere we'll meet again, I know

Fulfill the hope of mine

Wrecked and lonely he was to be 
A typhoon set his ship aground 

And he cursed the cruel sea 
The sea took him with it's mighty hand 
Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land 

Stranded - in a foreign land! 
Stranded - without people he could understand 
He's a man, proud and strong 
A man, with just one aim 
A man, who never did any wrong 
And he is not to blame 
Stranded - in a foreign land! 
Stranger in a very strange land 

He met his old foes the priests again 
He had no weapon in his hand 
Against their might he stood one man

Tossed him up, he's stranded in a unknown land

Still he didn't lose his pride 
Struggling on and hoping only

Them times there, yeah, my hearing was hard
Snakes in the clique, there was bare in the grass
Can I get the mic, man? I'm raring to start
Heart's too big and it beats too loud

Don't you ever let em see you down
Don't you ever let em take your crown

Sold me the dream and I went and I bought it
I can't even afford it
Should've payed safe, put it straight to my mortgage
It's too late now, can't-can't turn back
Time's one thing that you can't turn back

Girl, you the baddest
That's why I'll give you it the way you never had it
You keep it real, hold it down, let me see you turn around

Gets outshined by that Hennessy, still get it done, yeah, that's any means
And that's faith, we had love, I turned cold and left you broken
But you came back 'cuh the love cuts deep and I let you breathe but you left me choking
And we all know that you had my soul when I had yours too but I still weren't coping
Feel like Frank would, fuel in my tank, got one more mile to the ocean
Then you come along but the summer's gone and this thing might take some time
All those summer songs and those Jägerbombs and that day when I made you mine
You're not blessed but you say you're fine, I could swear that's your favourite line
All that I need and you're all that I see, let me help you breathe, let me save your life
You get caught in a whirl when you talk to your girls and they say that I'm bad news
You get wrapped in their words and it actually hurts cause we both know that's not true
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's, it's time that we both take charge
If we get it right then we'll never die, I just hope we can make it last, yo

Can we make the world spin slow? Let's work it out till it's better
I would never let this love grow, then you say never say never
And you kept me warm in the snow, with your tush as light as a feather
You said I was close to killing us both, we both know love's so painful
You came in my life and you made it alright and for that, man, I'm so grateful
Girl, this love is ours and it's no one else's and you need me to survive
You can light the way or return the flame, I just hope we can keep it alight, yo

Alright look, let's just get one thing clear, I don't fuck about
I am the certi' one
I am the one that they call 'Gangster of Grime'
I don't like it but I don't mind it
But I need everyone to know, and I'm not just talking about the hood, 
I ain't just talking about the basics
I'm talking about the whole island of this country, 
Needs to understand what is about to happen
If you put all bias aside, Stormzy has to be Neo, he has to be
So therefore that makes me Morpheus so I'm telling the council right now
This kid, no joke, you can hate him all you want
This kid has to be seeing the game in zeros and ones, 
Like, it's not normal, it's not normal
So hashtag 'merky', hashtag 'problem', (mad bro) hashtag 'wickedskengman'
Na, I like that one, no I like that one
And I don't even know what a hashtag is, 
I just know it's proper merky
You know, you know a hashtag's a bit more advanced than me
But what people do need to understand is, 
You see anyone from my era of Grime, need to recognise
That if you cannot fathom that this guy's about to take it 
From a second rate genre to a first rate genre
Then you need to look at yourself and be ashamed, 
Seriously, you have to be ashamed
Because we started from the roots of this ting (Word)
Now we've gone past the roots, it's a whole digital age, 
We don't need the middle man
Mr. Smith is nearly obsolete, 
We don't need those label ones again (word, word)
We can actually just shot it ourselves and cut through
So everyone needs to understand that when I'm telling you, and I'm certi', 
My name's Crazy Titch, I'm definitely one million percent certified
I know certi' guys from all over, Brum, Manchester, Notts, Sheffield, Leeds, Manny, Liverpool
These people all say the same thing, 
'We don't really even know what Grime is but we know who Stormzy is'
You know like, so, I don't wanna hear man say 
'I'm too gangster listening to Stormzy'
Shut up, that's a lie, you ain't
You know them ones right there
It just means you're a hater, 
No real talk, it just means you're a hater
You know like, that's what it is, this is my opinion and it is my opinion, 
I don't care what no one says
Real talk, those old guys that don't wanna bring him in
Whatever man, fuck yourself man, you know like real talk""

""Mad brother""

""Get a Coke and a smile man, seriously, 
Don't play them man there no mind, brudda
All them other side crap guys better just shut their mouth,

Yeah man, there you go""

I think about the past sometimes and I sober up
'Cause if that boy looks back, it'll hold him up
Man are out here beefin' like we ain't broke enough
Swear these bruddas ain't woken up
Like what have I done to deserve this life?
I got brothers in the pen that I'll never see again
Got my brothers dem servin' life

I've been gone for a while but I saw you niggas smile
When I cancelled all my tours (little pussies)
Someone tell 'em that I'm back
I don't never ever slack, grab my gun and go to war (boy)
I got brothers up in jail, going mad up in their cells
When you hear me, bang your doors (bang your doors)
Niggas moving chatty, someone tell them that I'm scatty
Bro, I'll pull up uninsured like (skkkkkrrr)
Running through my strip, rappers jumping on my dick
Just to build up a rapport (it's embarrassing)
I can tell them man are bitter
But they're begging it on Twitter, man, I swear I'm so appalled
Before he takes a shot, I'll shoot him first (shoot him first)
And poor mum, we was going through her purse (through her purse)
We were doing road and doing church
Looked the devil in his face like motherfucker, do your worst
Still here tryna' find another blessing
I'm over-loyal, man, I'll ride for what I'm repping
Dark times niggas dying in recession
You was fighting with your girl when I was fighting my depression, wait
Okay

Alright, first things first, coulda put you in a hearse
Man, I gave you boys a lifeline (lifeline)
I was scrolling through my tweets, had Adele up on repeat
And saw a madness on my timeline (on my timeline)
LBC's tryna' black ball me
And tryna' blame your boy for knife crime (like what?)
I don't use a shank, I got money in the bank
Man, I'd rather do a drive by (dickheads)
Mad, mad demons in my thoughts
Young Stormz wasn't ready for the limelight (he wasn't ready)
Took a little break from the game, started praying
Man, I had to get my mind right (started praying)
All black clothes till I shine bright
Full beams fucking up my eyesight
They hate me on the sly
But I bet you if I died, you would see em at my night night (fake youts)
They asking if I'm real, I'm real enough ('nough)
Still got a couple killers in the cut (cut)
If he's coming nice
I big him up, drugs kill
But my niggas make a killing off a drug (aye)
Rapping like I'm jigga but I'm puff (puff)
West End wanna show a nigga love (love)
But if it weren't me you would never let my niggas in the club
Fuck DSTRKT and fuck all these nightclubs
And fuck giving money to people that don't like us
There's riots in the city just tell me where I sign up
The rave goes silly every time I pick the mic up (whoa)
I got smoke, you can hold a bit
A coloured brother with a bone to pick
But I still get to gunning, don't be running when I bang mine
Before we said our prayers, there was gang signs (gang signs)",First Things First
Stormzy,"One more time I'll make it clear
This some shit I hate to share
Escape this life or pay the fare

This is all I got so lay me bare

Lord help me please I'm breaking down
Tryna call my name and take my crown
Little bit of pain I'll paint the town
When they put me in my grave don't make a sound
'Cause there's still some days I find it hard
Smoke my spliff and write my bars
I know they see me climb the charts
But plaques don't help me find my heart
Yo God, what's good? I need you bad
Devil's in my ear, I need you back
Got scars in my soul, I've been attacked
Even when I'm low I seem relaxed
But the year's been mad I lost my way
They think I went ghost to drop my tape
Not knowing that I fell and lost my faith
Like Satan please no, not today
So fuck this shit this ain't a joke
Just to get away I take a toke
I took this pain and made a boat
Lord knows how the fuck it stayed afloat
Last year I cried too many times
Weren't for Flipz and weren't for rhymes
Weren't for Rachel, weren't for Kelly
Man them people saved my life
Like, man, I get low sometimes, so low sometimes
Airplane mode on my phone sometimes
Sitting in my house with tears on my face
Can't answer the door to my bro sometimes
Roaming around all alone sometimes
Them lonesome times
I was a young dead start
But this shit's like Game of Thrones sometimes

One more time I'll make it clear

Like bro I can't believe I saw my dad
Still up in the ends, still driving cabs
He said ""Yo son, I need a car""
I kissed my teeth and turned my back
Like ""Nigga, you ain't seen my face for years
Nigga, you ain't seen my face for time
And the first thing you're asking me for, is that?
Fuck you! That's where I draw the line""
Should've dashed through a rack like ""Keep the change""
And fuck letting go, I'll keep the pain
Twenty-three years I'm still the same
When you hear this I hope you feel ashamed
'Cause we were broke like what the fuck
Mum did well to hold us up
But yet she still forgave your arse
But mumsy's cool, I'm cold as fuck
Fuck that! I'm still not over this
Fuck that! No, I'm still not over this
Flipz told me someone died in Heath
Like ""Please say I don't know the kid""
When I heard TS, I kissed my teeth
And then I broke down in disbelief
My bro TH and Yogi too
Man I'll be damned to miss the streets
But I still got old school friends that I shoulda' been cool with
Man that I ride for, man I went school with
Man that I love and man I kicked ball with
My phone's there, just call it
But I guess things just got strange for me
But you all grew fast and gracefully
Left my hood and grabbed the mic
And I got me a girl that prays for me

One more time I'll make it clear

Stornoway,"Waiting for a train 
Going nowhere in a nowhere station
Staying up last night 
Going nowhere with my trains of thought
Sleeping with your boy
Going nowhere in a long distance relation
Blinded of your senses
By the fear of unrequited love

Once more I woke up in the moonlight
Once more our paths crossed through the night
And a moment's hesitation
Your silent invocation
But you shielded me from your glow
Like a moth against your window
And I'm too shy to stop you in your tracks
Oh you leave me in the dark

Drifting in my boat 
Going nowhere with my aspirations
You and me connected 
Unexpected in our drifting thoughts
But you still see him
And I am sinking in the storm of separation
Blinded of my senses
By the fear of unrequited love

Once more I woke up in the moonlight
And twice more our paths crossed through the night
And a moment's hesitation
Your silent invocation
But you shielded me from your glow
Like a moth against your window
And I'm too shy to stop you in your tracks
Oh you leave me in the dark again
And I need someone
To stop me from drifting
It's getting late to be traveling

Destined to go nowhere
By the fear of unrequited love",Boats and Trains

I know your seasons and your sanctuaries
And when I'm wheeling over your wild white horses I know
There's nowhere else that I belong

I am a small town you are a tornado
And down the high street you tear into me
Bring down the power lines a
And you twist the heart right out of me
Leaving my outskirts devastated

And as you're going tears are flowing
'Cause while you're leaving I'm still believing

You are a memory I am the mind you enter
A single moment in a single bed
This is the feeling you are bringing back to me of when

On my doorstep blinking in the sunshine
Blamed and framed I'm frozen in the picture
Hanging in the space you left inside me
Climbed upstairs into the final scene

Waiting for the credits to appear
For all the years that I've been starring
Starring in a film with you and leading
Leading with a star I knew but I'm waking up
In a lone beam of light where the dust is dancing
As the music fades

On my way out for the very last time
Off my doorstep straight into the sunshine
Walking west and following the coastline

Looking for a sea change
You led me here when the world began
And the breakers shook the moonlit sand
Saw your pale face shining through the spray
And I was blown away 

With the feeling I was starring
Starring in a film with you and leading

Stornoway,"Curled up in the back of the car
Nine years old you don't know where you are
And your head's on the window, your eyes are just closed
There's a voice in the front and a hush on the road
You're a passenger but your mind is traveling on.

Open your eyes and you're nine years older
Hands on the wheel and you're racing on over
To lie with your first love, you can't wait to see her
You borrowed the car and you think you're the driver
But now you're the passenger to your own heart
And it takes you traveling, traveling on.

When the morning broke and the sky fell down
It went black as night and the wind blew round
And stole your directions, you lost your way home
And you felt like a passenger left by the road
But I'll tell you the reason you couldn't get home
Cause there's nowhere you've been 
And it's nowhere you're going
Home is only a feeling you get in your mind
From the people you love and you travel beside
You may feel like a passenger but now you're the driver
You've got to go traveling, traveling on
Because if you break down, it's a cold, hard shoulder

So fuel up your mind and fire up your heart and drive on
Drive on, drive on
And when your days are darker, put your foot down harder
Drive on, drive on.

And it's nine more years you've been driving now
But tonight you're stumbling through your old town
You met up with a schoolfriend who's still just the same
And you talked all the same shit you talked in those days

And now you're drunk 
And you're sad for the old times passing you by
For there's no rewind so you might as well play 

While your time is rolling away
And get back on the road, it's a beautiful day
Pick up all the friends you can find on your way
And if you lose direction they'll be there guiding you on
Guiding you, guiding you on.

Because we're all going 
The same way down this long road
Yes, we're all bound 
The same way down this long, long road.

So fuel up your mind 
And fire up your heart and drive on
Drive on, drive on
And when your days are darker, 
Put your foot down harder
Drive on
Fuel up, and drive on
Fuel up, and drive on

Alone in this place where I've been living
My real home lives down the river
Where she's making circles with her tears

And February blows even colder 
And I'll send my love downstream
In words and verses in plastic boxes 
She's still unready to take them in
And they're bobbing underneath the bridges
Out to the ocean back
Back on the rocks

And the rain came down back in December
When you told me you were drifting
The waters rose while my door swung closed
On the circles that you lived in 
We got so caught up in the swirls and eddies
You never saw where you were heading
Oh you were bobbing underneath the bridges
Out to the ocean and back
Back on the rocks
    
And spring is only round the corner 
As I'm writing you this final letter
I'll drop it in the cool green water
At the bridge where we jumped in together
And I hope it will be carried to you
Cast upon the rocks beside you
And I hope the words serve to remind of
Someone you can leave behind you
Someone who's got a hole inside
Someone who'll be waiting here for you

To take me from this burning bridge 
Before I end up back

Deeper than blue was the dusk through the trees
With the last of the leaves clinging on like my mother's hand
Cold as the sandpaper wind on my cheeks

Over the river and under the railway
Moon lighting silver the ribbon of road
And the phone lines were whistling like my mother's breathing
And my eyes were streaming

There's a clock on my wall
Sometimes I hear it in my dreams
But I won't be afraid of the changes a comin'
While I know a love that is sure as the morning

There's a light in the clockhouse
A light in the chapel
A light in the hallway left on by an angel
And I creak up the stairs and I pause at the threshold
To take off my boots and my clothes in the dark

With my nose like a fox and my skin like a chicken
I steal into my bed where it's warm as an oven
And you feel like the bread made in my mother's kitchen
And we're peaceful as a candle

And the clock on my wall
Sometimes I hear it in my dreams

Story of the Year,"Now I can taste
The war that I've been fighting
Start to fall but I'm still standing here
Behind this wall of dying faith

I can't forget
The fight that's growing stronger
Face to face with hopes of longer days
To build on something we should save

I stand alone, I'm on my own
My hands will bleed
My hands will bleed
I'm holding on to what is gone
What's left of me?

You I'm falling down
Well I should find my strength in this
A light that burns to reconnect my heart
For what it's meant to give

I stand alone, I'm on my own
My hands will bleed
My hands will bleed
I'm holding on to what is gone
What's left of me?

Walk, fall
Stand again so I can
Walk, fall
Stand again so I can
Walk, fall
Stand again so I can

I stand alone, I'm on my own
My hands will bleed
My hands will bleed
I'm holding on to what is gone
What's left of me?

Story of the Year,"We both take the hardest punches
And collect black eyes just to prove it
Still we passed by just like strangers
And we speak just like the closest enemies
Enemies

Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far

Somehow my words rendered useless
Still I pull my lip down to my fucking chest
Am I choking, tired of waiting
To say the things that you should hear

Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far

After all we're still the same
These empty promises seem to never change
There's a smile on my face and it's 2:55 a.m.
And this cramp in my wrist
Puts me back asleep till all comes around again

With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist
With a closed fist

Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can fall into the night unscarred
Woah, in the shadows of our life
We can never let it go this far

Story of the Year,"The bridge is all crumbled. 
The water soaks into rocks 
That fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.)
The town that we lived in. 
The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow

Over the sidewalks, 
Running away from the streets we knew, 
Sidewalks, 
Like the time we thought was made for you. 
Or 

Out on the front porch, 
Watching the cars as they go by
(Eighteen blue, twenty one gray) 
Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive, 
Out on our own, 
To speed away 

From the sidewalks, 
Running away from the streets we knew, 
Sidewalks, 
Like the time we thought was made for you. 
Or 

All of the days have passed us by, 
All of the sun is gone, away.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.
On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
Every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
Thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines,
Every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every hero and coward,
Every creator and destroyer of civilization,
Every saint and sinner in the history of our species,
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that,
In glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Same struggles that I have
And my heart goes out to You

I know it’s hard to feel alone
And this world's so unforgiving
I've been feeling that way too

Storyteller,"When it was time to move on to the castle of evil 
There was a lot of doubt among the travelers.
They were not sure that they wanted to continue this quest, 
And why should they? If they turned back now 
Maybe they would survive instead of meeting the same fate as Darek. 
And riding towards the castle would only bring one thing, death. 
It was in that moment of doubt that Siam began to speak.

As I started to make this journey I traveled alone
Not knowing what waited for me on the other side
But I always knew that this was destined just for me
Chosen by fate to battle the evil one

And no, no I can not change this prophecy
No, it's already written in my fate

And now that I've come this far into the unknown
This quest feels so hard to bear on my shoulders
And I cannot ask of you to join me to the end
But if I face this alone then I will die

Bu no, no I will not change my destiny
No, I shall follow the sign because

I, I know it's my destiny
And there is nothing here for me
So now, you got to choose you see
Stay here where you'll be safe and warm
Or to carry on
And if you stay then I go alone
Into the land of the dark

Together we're strong enough
There's no way we will lose
Together we'll carry on
United as one we will give them a fight
To battle were riding on
With steel in our hands
In glory we're riding on
Try to fulfill our quest

And no, no we shall not change our destiny
No, we shall follow the sign because

Storyteller,"Although our travelers had seen a lot of horrible things during their 
journey, nothing would
prepare them for what they were about to see when they entered the 
village... Women and children
were slaughtered like cattle. On giant poles, warriors and old men were 
impaled, and all around the
village there was a very thick and dark fog. Never before had they seen such 
cruelty, and no one,
not even the brave dwarf could keep the tears from falling. There was no 
doubt that the army of
darkness had paid a visit to this village. And by the damage made to the 
village they were quite
sure that the dark side had found the book of mystery. That was the only 
thing capable of doing
this kind of damage.

Suddenly! Someone cried out in agony! The travelers froze for a few 
seconds... were the dark
army still around the area? The air was quiet... but there! Behind that old 
ruin! Someone was
moving. They all ran towards the ruin, and what they saw came as a shock to 
them.

There was a survivor. A woman, bruised and beaten, but still alive. As they 
began to speak to
her it turned out that she was one of a warrior clan with a mission of 
guarding the book of
mystery. Obviously they had failed. Someone inside the clan had betrayed 
them, and sold the
information to the evil one, and therefore the book of mystery was now in 
the hands of the dark
side.

She had sworn an oath to guard the book, and to the gods she now swore to 
bring it back to the
sorcerers of light, no matter what. So when they left the village they had 
one more traveler by
their side, and her name was Kira the Guardian.

Soldiers were coming far from the hills
To seek the magic we concealed
My people were slaughtered, taken as slaves
To work until their dying days

But I know that one day
I will see victory
That's why I'll follow you
That's why I won't give in
Yes I know that one day
I will see victory
That's why I'll follow you
That's why I won't give in

So now that it's taken, it won't be long
Before their powers will be strong
Using the magic that's in the book
Their reign shall grow, the dark will rise

But I know that one day
I will see victory...

And as we leave the place that was my home
That now is laid in ruins
I swore an oath to restore the book of light again
And take it were it is safe
From all greed, from the dark, and misery

So follow my footsteps, and have no fear
I'll be your guide through the shadows
Always be ready, always be sharp
If we shall survive in the dark

But I know that one day
I will see victory...",The Secret's Revealed

(making this money man) uh-huh, true that true that
Check this out, it's going down over here
On the South, so I'm bout to come over
There on the North and scoop you up
We gotta put it down, boys ain't feel us in 9-9
With that Braids N' Fades, it's Y2K baby
Know I'm tal'n bout, candy coated still putting it down
Still swanging and banging ha, boys gon feel us man

Candy coated Exursion, swang and bang
Still gripping grain
(Northside man huh, Southside what)

See I'm a wide body roller, wood grain remote controller
Blades on Escalades, electric shocks on Range Rovers
Man the game over, when me and Slim pull up
You see us flossing on chrome, with the styrofoam cup
I got a eight and a liter, swanging on the feeter
In the Bentley watching BET, I'm tripping off of Cita
Cristal margaritas, we some block bleeders
My balling tire size, can't ride in two-seaters
Man I need Excursion, or my Navigator
My big body Denali, sqauatting like a Florida Gator
Tell them playa haters, E.S.G. I don't bar
50 cash and dash, like my name was Peter Warren
I parallel parked it, ghetto starts cost to Mars
Man my rims cost more, than some boys cars
Hit the Boulevard, with the nine on my lap-lap
Southside on the map-map, Screw tape tap-tap

Now when I come down, I be throwing up the North shwoing off
Six gallons of gloss, on my 7-9 Boss
I floss the candy cream gleam, when I pull on the scene
My four 18's and screens, got my shit sitting mean
My drop top is a supreme, king of a young team's dream
Like a diamond it bling-bling, when it's hit with sun beams
Shoot more spiders in my ring, when I glide up the block
I got a trunk full of knock, about to bust air shocks
I'm shutting down the parking lot, when you see me ride
See me sitting high with pride, sliding on the buck hide
Looking pretty, on a tour all across my city
Sipping drank by the pint, about to bust my kidney
From the North to the South, we gon represent
I'm getting bent behind tint, pros by the air vent
I spent a lot of cash to shine, but it came in handy
Cause like a child, Slim Thug is so in love with candy huh

Looking laid in the 'Sacci, or the Gucci shades

Candy red smash, syrup make you lean fast

That candy blue or that green, gon keep our slab looking clean

I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K

Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro

I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again

Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though

Straitjacket Fits,"And I quietly count with her gone
Name any number and I'm counting beyond
Playing it coolly, though you know it isn't even really there
Caress one night away, I was looking for more
More, more, more

But she
She speeds
Elusive as a thief in the night, she's stealing away
She rides the wind, she burn, burns
Yeah she rides the wind, she burn, burns

And her speeding, her freedom's what's appealing to me
to stop her in her tracks
Match an act with flat tactics of attack
These eyes may be steady but my cigarette is shaking

With way deep saying, why don't you leap in
But she, she goes, so no
Leave it, but you know at times it seems

Standing on the seashore and the tide
Comes rolling through your eyes

Comes rolling through your mind

Blinded in the white light and the crowd
Die slowly in your arms
You're left to lie alone
And save your face of changing color
And your smile of fading color

Could it be that you don't understand me?
I doubt myself sometimes, never, always
And I don't feel like holding out

I make resolutions, I won't back down
Then comes a rainstorm, and I hit the ground

The wind's tapping out a message for us
A message I already know
The wind's picking up as our words become
The litter of the night before
Words that seem so empty now
Blowing round the room
Getting twisted and torn
Everybody's in their own world
Everybody's staring at the floor
No-one wanna see the sign in the sky
Says people don't talk anymore
I don't wanna stay here
But I don't think I can go
I don't wanna stay here
But I really don't think I can go
It must have been some evil one
It must have been a twisted joke
Whoever it was round here
Turned on that radio
My God it's a sick world
Out there on the radio
Any way you look at it man
Were on our way out
At the end of it all
I gotta say it's a sick world
In here it's a human disgrace
Are you saying if we can get some
We're gonna make it to the moon
But I don't wanna go there
But I don't wanna stay
No I don't wanna stay here

Calling out for anyone to make it go away
Try to kill the picture the flowers in her hair
Or taking shots of anything so I don't have to care
Staring at a paper cup
The emptiness inside
She's going high someday
She's going high someday.
Living with a photograph is really not the same
I've kept it in the suitcase where no one ever came
Watching other insects as they feel around my walls
They say that taking anything don't change a thing at all
Stare again - the photograph
The plastic is her mind
She's going high someday
She's going high someday.
Crawls up the walls, yes she crawls up the walls
Staring at my body,
Christ! It isn't mine at all.
Crying out for someone to make it go away
To take away this photograph so I can live again
Staring at the plastic cups
The emptiness inside

She's going high someday.

To a place you've never ever been before
Where no one goes
Yet still you're not alone
Yu wonder why
As you look into the the sky
The clatter-clatter-clatter of electric pylons
Are carrying chattering electric wires
Like a spider's web
Just above your head
It's a spider's web just above your head
It's the telephone dead on the internet

Sell your friends and
Sell your mother

Whisperin' my name and laughin'
Edgin' up the hall into my bed
Faces on the walls are screamin'
Driftin' out across the ceilin'
Droppin' off and fallin' in my head

All alone they cut the phones

In and out of every openin'
Up and down and over me all night
Lookin' through my old scrapbook
I search in vain for pleasant memory
Tearin' out my hair 'til it gets light

All alone, I'm heard to groan
My epitaph, I regret everythin'
There's gonna be no sleep 'til the bones
Break through my skin

Another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is eager in the wings
Of a skeleton grin, oh no
And I don't know where he stops and I begin

It's just another night in, another night in
I shiver within, a slow hand clap begins
Another night in, another night in
Woah, my skeleton is waitin' in the wings
Of another night in, just another night in
Woah, another night in

Watchin' the wildlife drift by on the outside
Watchin' the movement on my bit of sky
Watchin' my face disappear in the mirror
All in the name of another night in

Oh no no, this skeleton thing

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd

IÂ´m learning how to believe
I know now that this is the way
IÂ´ve found my red-letter day
I've been there out on a limb
But now IÂ´ve finally come in 

IÂ´ve turned the tables Â´round and found another way
IÂ´ve left it all behind for a better day 

I will take things as they come
Look out for number one
And IÂ´ll be back tomorrow

She's too young for the club but the guys at the door don't mind her. 
The boys are all lining up for their chance to wine and dine her. 
She thinks she's working the scene 
But she's caught up in a web full of spiders 
(and all the drinks they buy her) 

She don't like cocaine, baby just likes how it smells
Says maybe you can drive me home if you want. 

Then you wake up beside her saying ""baby I think you should leave""
She had a really rough night, she got too high, now she can't breathe 
And if the ambulance comes you know they're gonna bring the police, 
So you wrap her up tight, put her to sleep beneath a willow tree 
And your hands are clean

She don't like cocaine, baby just likes how it smells

I feel a little suicidal, just not high enough to jump.

Are not the ones who sacrifice -

To the lies leading up to another corporate sponsored war

And it feels just right at the time

You're an actor forgetting your lines

You were a star when you started so bright eyed and ready
But now you just can't seem to shine
Nothing to lose is a path that you choose
And it feels just right at the time

But can you still remember your very first kiss?
Or the future you hoped for when we were still kids?
Stay young, stay young

There are constants like gravity, heartbreak and shame
You can never out run them, they're part of your name
Like lessons you learn from a past you can't change
Stay young, stay young

For a lifetime of paying dues and ruthless reviews
Yeah, it's hard not to end up a cynic
When everyone's too scared to walk in your shoes
But can work up the nerve to be critics

Oh, can you still remember your very first kiss?
Or the future you hoped for when we were still kids?
Stay young, stay young

No, don't lose your heart
Don't lose your soul
Don't give up control

It's the business end of a loaded gun
Facing tomorrows of black useless lungs
With nothing but lies left on tips of our tongues

Oh, can you still remember your very first kiss?
Or the future you hoped for when we were still kids?
Trying to keep up our innocence in this fucked up world

Is coming back to stay
I know, just look ahead

Approaching visions of things I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises
The night awaits

The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas

Haunts me once again
In your private chamber you're all alone
The well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
The flame of the candle casting movement to the wall

Your eyes filled with guilt keep staring at the door
Approaching visions of things I can´t recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain
Unkept promises

The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek

Stronger than steel we're the Legions of the Twilight

To undo this crime

Look into my eyes do you see the truth
I'm lost and alone feelings unknown
Come to me stronger than before

On winds of time my soul will fly
The angels are knocking at my door
Oh now I need to be free
From all this hatred I feel inside

Let it be my dreams
Let it be my thoughts
All those things in my heart
One too many days
One too many years
I wasted for nothing
I never realized
The truth is inside
Of every man for all to see
Listen to me now
I'm so close to you
Never felt like this before

The carousel is spinning fast
Better enjoy while it lasts
Every moment is like gold
You'll remember when you're old
And the meaning of this life
Is to live and is to die
Make the best out of your dreams
They're the world where you are free
All the sorrow and the pain
Will be washed away by rain
An eternal joy will come
It can be found by everyone
Though the end is drawing near

I have found the truth inside
After all the tears I've cried

They shall unjustly put down the holy laws
And by thunder and war true believers shall die

Buried ones shall come out of their graves

Within embrace of universal womb

For the young girl who's gone away
She had to return to where she came from
How I wish she would stay, even for one more day

I only knew her a little while
But I'll never forget the time
When we stood on the bridge at the edge of the world
And she asked what was on my mind
Tell me what's on your mind

And I sang a song of sadness 
For the moments forever lost
She had to return to where she came from
Though the seasons have changed 
The loneliness still remains

The cool clear sunshine mornings 
With honey flavored tea 
And the notebooks she kept
On the things that she loved
Were open for me to see
All her secrets for me to see

And I sing a song of sorrow
For the young girl who's gone away
She had to return to where she came from
How I wish she would stay, even for one more day",Blues for a Young Girl Gone

When you're up in clouds forever,
Pacify your mind with islands
Colored snow and green-field skies and,

Floating free, walk upon the sand
Got to give you things much better
My mushroom's green and brown forever.

I've wondered where
Ever since then

[Chorus]
Won't you take me back there again
I dreamt of drowning
But it never was as good as when
You'd take me down and under

I could have told you
The same thing yesterday
But I could not find
The words I wanted to say
You never listened to me anyway
I've wondered why
Ever since then

[Chorus: x2]

Why can't we go back there now
You could take my hand
And we could go back like before
I'd like to go down there once more",Deep Water
Strawberry Switchblade,"You know why I don't want to see you
Remember when we went to the bay
You had your car so we thought we'd go
Since t was such a nice day

I remember walking with you to the rocks
Now knowing what you had in mind
I closed my eyes to make a wish
But  opened them up to find

You had slipped away
And I wondered why
Thinking you'd return
I thought I would stay
But after a while you hadn't returned
Then it didn't seem such a nice day

I remember sitting there on the rocks
Not knowing you had gone away
I was sitting there on my own
Wiping the tears away

[Chorus]
Go away, I wish you would
Go away, oh won't you please
Go away, I wish you would go

You've come to ask me how I am
But I don't want to see you today
You said it was fun but I cannot smile
I just wish that you would go away

I still remember sitting there
On the rocks
Not knowing you had gone away
I was sitting there on my own
Wiping the tears away

Go away, I wish you would
Go away, oh won't you please
Go away, I wish you would
Go away, oh won't you please

She does not want to be with you
She told me so

From under her skin
But it's not been that easy
Because you just won't give in

[Chorus]
And I know
I would let go
I know, I know

I know it's wrong
It can't  possibly go on
She can't drop a friend
Just because you say so

I love her more than you do
Yet I can't get near her
It isn't fair that you should
Say who can and can't see her

[Chorus]

She has a mind of her own
And she's going to use it
She told you to step down
So you'll have to do it
Maybe you'll try it again
But it won't work out that I know
You can't push anymore
You'll just have to let her go

Looking for a reason to go on
It's so clear that all we have now
Are our thoughts of yesterday

If you're still there when it's all over
I'm scared I'll have to say
That a part of  you has gone

Stray Cats,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

I've told myself this a million times before
Time and time again, I try to see things 'til the end
But sometimes something seems to hold me right back to the ground 

Over and over again, I think of what it could have been
If I had kept my head on straight and out of the clouds
This feeling inside of me, nowhere left to hide
It's like a bomb waiting to explode inside of me 

You've got to stand up for yourself
Don't rely on no one else
Only you know where you stand in life
Go after your dreams
It's easier than it seems
Only you know where you stand in life

And keep on holding on to what's dear to you

Is to enjoy life and to keep on holding on and on

Back to my girl
Back to my family and kids
Have to go and see my home again

It brings me comfort while I'm stuck in this desert mess
But don't get me wrong, perform my mission
Just sounding off on my homesick condition
Got to get out, a short timer, my heart it begs for home

Seen many a firefight since we deployed out here
Learned how to survive with my friends
They're focus, adrenaline and fear

Hope some days still lie ahead for me

Too short to turn back
Gotta go back

Street Dogs,"You alone must stand your ground
You take a life worth nothing and turn it around
You stand alone, yeah that's the deal
You have yourself to count on cause no one really cares

At your wit's end with no hope in sight
You turn on Costello it's welcome to the working week
You're broke and cornered no one to call
On your shoulders the hardship falls
Yet something inside you stirs and you begin to smile

Faced with few options you look to yourself
And begin to decide that

You alone must stand your ground
You take a life worth nothing and turn it around
You stand alone, yeah that's the deal

Optimism runs partner with it
The pendulum swings into your favor now
Cash in pocket you earn your keep
With security you now sleep
Your mandate never quit sustaining you

Street Dogs,"There is power in democracy, power in the land
Power in the hands of a worker
But it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand
There is power in a union

Now the lessons of the past were all learned in workers' blood
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for
From the cities to the farmlands, in trenches full of mud
Cause war has always been the bosses' way, sir

The union forever defending our rights
Let's fight the right wing, all workers unite
With our brothers and sisters from many far off lands
There is power in a union

Now I long for the time that they realize
Brutality and unjust laws cannot defeat us
But who'll defend the workers who cannot organize?
When the GOP send their attorneys out to cheat us?

Money speaks for money, the devil for his own
Who'll come to speak for the skin and the bone?
What comfort to a widow, a light for a child
There is power in a union

The union forever defending our rights
Let's fight the right wing, all workers unite
With our brothers and sisters from many far off lands

Street Dogs,"All of my life I've searched for clarity
I have wrestled with some paths very deep inside of me
I lost some rounds, been knocked around
Felt my share of defeat
Yet somehow I've always managed to get back...on my feet
The world keeps telling me to a grip or I won't last
Gotta break away from solitude and let go of my past
I've never found it easy to change my stubborn ways
Or to give perspective, throw away those soul-less days.

We have prayed
We still searching for something more
We have struggled

We sing the words of our favorite songs, they bring us home
We find a little comfort, a little peace of mind

Street to Nowhere,"The sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm tangled in sheets
It creeps between my eyelids
Seems the blinds sprung a leak
Pills crushed in wine are a headache sometimes
But not 'til the feelings worn off
Still the sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm not getting up
There's nothing like a beautiful morning
No there's nothing like a beautiful day
No there's nothing like a beautiful morning
To make me hate the way I hate myself today
The sun hangs over Sunday
I pull the blankets over my head
And it creeps between the stitches
I melt like wax in my bed
There was someone here last night
Before I closed my eyes
She's just a scent on the sheets
Still the sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm gettin' the fuck back to sleep
The sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm hung over as well
The sun hangs over Sunday
And I'm hung over as hell

You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light,  move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow 
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last

We been doin' all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is

Well what you want me to do?

Express yourself!

I'm expressin with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight and meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flava, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube; because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat; and it'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to diss one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science; while I'm droppin english
Even if Yella, makes it acapella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage, nnothin'
But makin a sucka and you equal
Don't be another sequel

Whoa!
Express Yourself

Now, gettin back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend
Again and again and again, yo, you're on the other end
Whatch a brother blend dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' or guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes which fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when upon the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you will hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin for the ""Dopeman""
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear Stretch Arm Strong say, ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to express yourself!

Whoa!
Express yourself

Cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it (a big part of it)

Expression is a big part of it, a big part of it!

There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith and Wessun for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, Stretch Arm Strong is the lynch mob!
Yes I'm a climb, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here is the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself, Yella, slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage
Or I'm a be too hyped, and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we're gettin' hyped tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

Express yourself!
Whoa

Come on and do it
Come on and do it

Reality and rawness I find, I know this is truth.
Stripped of all my pretense I feel so lost and naked.
With your tenderness for love I can make it.
Confusion, fear consume my thoughts the things I say and do.
It's all so difficult because I'm not with you.

Stretch Armstrong,"Shattered lives and broken worlds
Pieces of life scattered all around
The art of politicians spread their
Canvas all over town
Thick lines of red
All the lies and promises
The images won't leave their minds
The witnesses can't leave it all behind

Hearts on fire burning hot
Searching for more blood to feed them
With their desire they'd rather not look 
For peace while their hatred's breeding 

Destroy! Rebuild!
It won't bring it back
All the life we've killed!

Back through time in and out of days
Fragmented lives seem to waste away
The monsters have once again made their mark
They paint with thick lines of red
All the lies and promises
The images won't leave their mind
The witnesses can't leave it all behind

Hearts on fire burning hot
Searching for more blood to feed them
With their desire they'd rather not look 
For peace while their hatred's breeding
And this will never end until their weapons melt
And we will never see or fell what they felt

(It is the people's unlimited responsibility to choose and to act in accordance with that which is helpful to all living things! How much more so must this be the case for our leaders?)

We've got the numbers but we're running out of time
One voice united we echo through these lines
We've got the numbers
Running out of time

Free at last is what we saw
But tonight we had it all
Free at last is what we saw
But tonight we had it all

Destroy! Rebuild!
It won't bring it back
All the life we've killed!

I will draw the line like I have one thousand times before
But this time it stays firmly in place
The smile no longer resides on my face
Summer has passed, the streets are empty now

Not this time
I want to run away, I gotta get away
Can we find a better way?
Not this time

Right now, right here
This is our last resort, but the air is clearing
The situation is too tough to report but the outcome is still pending

These words cannot express my longing
And my desire to erase these memories from my mind
So I lie here waiting for the right time
Could it be the right time to turn and walk away

Stretch Armstrong,"[Chorus:]
I've been up three long days and we've covered a million miles.
Or so it seems
My face is cracking from all the fears and miles,
My trials and all my dreams
And I know why I live this way
My energy left me, it's back today
Sacrifice my body and mind
Because this is our time.

So many dreams stretched over these endless miles
So many faces and places we left with endless smiles
But buried deep within our souls
The inability to let go

So many dreams stretched over these endless miles
So many faces and places we left behind

[Chorus]
I've been up three long days and we've covered a million miles
Or so it seems
My face is cracking from all the fears and smiles,
My trials and all my dreams
And I know why I live this way
My energy left me, it's back today
Sacrifice my body and mind
Because this is our time

So let's pack it up and gas it up
We'll give this one more try
And answer this burning question that's consumed us all the while
We'll give it everything we've got and if this ends today
We'll know that we gave it our best shot

And I know how it feels to be battered and frayed
And since we're all still here, I'm glad that I stayed

And tonight we'll make this ours

And so I'll pack my things and I'll wipe your crying eyes once again
It hurts to chase this dream but I'll follow this one through to the end

And I know why I live this way
My energy left me, it's back today
Sacrifice my body and mind
Because this is our time",To the End

They had a drink and when he asked her name
She told him Jennifer

He held the body of a waitress called Kaye
Who used to live in Sacramento
They danced right through the night and into the day

He drove her home in the sunlight of morning
He held her close in the car
But fourteen-year old Sara Lee was watching
She knew he'd gone much too far

It wasn't Jennifer who kissed him
'Cause when Dan took her hand he held Sara Lee
She knew that she could convict him

And lost the use of his car

Strife,"Reaching hands- cirkling down I see it twist to nothing torn from
What it meant, cou from extence...my fingers bleed, but reaching hands are not weak the light the tonce burned so bright, has now
Been cast a dismal grey. fighting to keep the voice alive, I cannot left
It end this way...i'm held- in the arms of the few! I walk in a line with
The skared, never breaking my vow. I swear to you. A rise of
Commitment strong, a vision to which it belongs. purty of the
Mind and body, to keep the resistance moving on ...
",Arms of the Few
Strife,"Imperfection seems to have gotten the best of me.
I beat myself down in this frustration.
In unreal aspiration- never allowing progression to begin- sights set so far ahead.
Missing the start I fall once more.
I must try one step at a time.
Facing this path alone, I will begin again.
I will begin again.
Obstacles come from within!
Sometimes so strong you must wait.
Take the time to catch your breath.
Face the path alone and begin again...Begin again.
Never let yourself go astray!
Making a change will take some time.
But you've got the time, you've got the time.
Face the path alone- Begin again!
Face what is there- what is there.
I must realize what is there, face, confront and never give in.
I must try one day at a time.
Facing the path alone, I won't let it win.



",Face
Strife,"The shadow is taking over by acceptance...the shadow is taking over.
The movement pulled below. strifled crises are thrown aside but I am
Searching for hope once more stagnations end- rebirth, insurgence...
Confide in fear, looked inside here, alone but never lost. soltude
Is mine. the answers to the question that kill this will. that boil in
Our blood... the fete is never sealed
",Shadow's End
Strife,"Just when it felt like these walls weren't so close, and the grip of what held me
Tight was close enough for my escape... I fell again, and where were you my
Cruch my need my everything there's a question of sinserty, but a question
Of what used to be... and for right now, I'm moving in the only way I know how.
And that's what I have to do. an escape may never be but I must try ...to be seen ...
Once more I'm sorry for all that's been lost- promises broken ... I'm slipping
Away.
",Slipping
Strife,"Stepping ground lost, fallen through the sands of time. The
Security once known has been stipped back and exposed. Strong
Hands which before expressed support have now faded from my sight.
Stong hands scorn my eyes to darken the light...and it just
Slips away. It burns. It burns in my heart. I thought I knew
What I was looking for. I thought I knew what I would find.
I thought I knew what would become of me. It feels like like
I knew nothing. Figure it out what's going on. Well in my heart I
Know I'm strong. Figure out what went wrong. It feels like
It took too long. Too long!
",Still Rise
Strife,"Will you ever know what it is feel for
You? can I express myself - is there any
Way to? it moves through and through it
Moves through me... look into these eyes
And tell me what you see. I'll call truth
And happiness sealed by destiny...inside
Me...can you see me...there is only one
Truth.
",Through and Through
Strife,"Reaching hands- cirkling down I see it twist to nothing torn from
What it meant, cou from extence...my fingers bleed, but reaching hands are not weak the light the tonce burned so bright, has now
Been cast a dismal grey. fighting to keep the voice alive, I cannot left

The skared, never breaking my vow. I swear to you. A rise of
Commitment strong, a vision to which it belongs. purty of the

",To the Surface
Strife,"What will remain of those days when it
All meant something to you, the kinds, and
Me- it was more than just something yes,
But it's changed.what will remain ofthose things that uses to be? some say
They're gone, but they'll never be gone in
Me. and I'll remain to see those days
Again...like before when to me, it feelt like
Something more. it didn't die it's just been
Ignored; what will remain of those days?
People changed, time is rearranged, lives
And goals do not remain the same, nothing
Stays the same...what will remain...
Will remain.
",What Will Remain
Strife,"Still hanging on the words from your lips 
Still trembling at my fingertips 
The end came sooner than expected 
It came without warning without mercy 
Believe in me you said, you said 
Trust in me you pled, you pled 
It's all misled 
Why did I believe 
How could I not see 

I wish I knew, so where do I go from here? 
Where do I belong? 
If not amongst you then with who? 
With who? 
I wish I knew  
I wish I knew  
I wish I knew  
I wish I knew  
With who",I Wish I Knew
Strife,"Blistered by a raging sun's flames 
Mankind sealed its fate in its haste 
Warning signs sent time after time 
We just sit back in all this waste 

All this waste 
And I will not wait 
I'll climb from this place 
I'll climb to the truth 

To the truth 
Blackened skies poisoned ashes cried 
Mankind sealed its fate in it's haste 
Warning signs sent time after time 

We just sit back ignore the waste 
All the waste 
An I cannot wait 
I'll climb from this place 

I'll climb to the truth 
To the truth 
To the truth 
Looking to the skies I can see the ashes falling 

Looking to the shy I can see it all coming down 
I can never give up 
I can never give up my fights right 
I can never give out 

I can never give out because mine is right 
My fight is truth 
My fight is truth",Blistered
