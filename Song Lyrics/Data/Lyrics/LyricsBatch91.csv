Elvis Costello,"If I could believe two and two is five
Two wrongs make a right
Well then, man alive
Lost in my insolence and sneers
That might sound like prayers
If I could believe

If I could believe
You were from heaven sent
Then just losing you
Would be my punishment
But in the hour of disgrace
I might see his face
If I could believe

If I could believe
Then I know I might
Sleep all through the night
But how many times must I wake in fright
Nagging doubts still tugging on my sleeve

If I could believe two and two is five
Two wrongs make a right
Well then, man alive
Lost in my insolence and sneers
That might sound like prayers
If I could believe
If I could believe",If I Could Believe
Elvis Costello,"Now that you set everybody free
What you going to do about me?
Don't want to be treated like some poor grateful clown
I'd rather go back in the sweet underground
Where I can tell the time by the color of my skin
And I know my neighbor 'cos he's the one, yes he's the one
Who always turns me in

A woman works the tunnel in the middle of the night
Picking up every lost object in sight
Handbags, toupees, lost legs and fingernails
The black market eats up all your failures
Her transistor offers no salvation or regrets
No pool, no pets, no cigarettes
Just non-stop Disco Tex and the Sex-o-lettes

There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
For the pain we'll cause you again and again
For the pain we'll cause you again and again

The Liberation Forces make movies of their own
Playing their Doors records and pretending to be stoned
Drowning out a broadcast that wasn't authorized
Incidentally the revolution will be televised
With one head for business and another for good looks
Until they started arriving with their rubber aprons and their butcher's hooks

There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
There's no name, there's no name
For the pain we'll cause you again and again
For the pain we'll cause you again and again

They're hunting us down here with Liberty's light
A handshaking double talking procession of the mighty
Pursued by a T.V. crew and coming after them
A limousine of singing stars and their brotherhood anthem
The former dictator was impeccably behaved
They're mopping up all the stubborn ones who just refuse to be saved

I refuse to be saved [x12]",Refuse to Be Saved
Elvis Costello,"They talked to the sister, the father and the mother
With a microphone in one hand and a chequebook in the other
And the camera noses in to the tears on her face
The tears on her face
The tears on her face
You can put them back together with your paper and paste

Stick out your tongue
Drink down the venom

She sleeps with the shirt of a late, great country singer
Stretched out upon her poor jealous husband's pillow
In time you can turn these obsessions into careers
While the parents of those kidnapped children start the bidding for their tears

What would you say?
What would you do?
Children and animals two by two
Give me the needle
Give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap

Four and twenty crowbars, jemmy your desire
Out of the frying pan into the fire
The king is in the counting house
Some folk have all the might
And majesty will run on Bombay Gin and German spite
They come from lovely people
(They come from lovely people)
With a hard line in hypocrisy
There are tears of mediocrity
For the fag ends of the aristocracy

What would you say?
What would you do?
Children and animals two by two
Give me the needle
Give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap

Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
Drink down the venom

The sugar-coated pill is getting bitterer still
You think your country needs you but you know it never will
So pack up your troubles in a stolen handbag
Don't dilly dally boys rally 'round the flag
Give us our daily bread, give us our daily bread, in individual slices, in individual slices
And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis

What would you say?
What would you do?
(Did you find out how to lie?)
Children and animals two by two
(Did you find out how to cheat?)
Give me the needle
(The elite bleat, they're obsolete)
We're going to melt them down for
Stick out your tongue
(We're going to melt them down for pills and soap)
Now if you'd only genuflect, now if you'd only genuflect
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue
Now if you'd only genuflect
Stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue, stick out your tongue",Stick Out Your Tongue
Elvis Costello,"Lightning up!
And shake the ground

Is that a horn that's blowing?
Or a bell that's tolling?
Walls are falling
Ships pulled out from their mooring
Is that a river or just a road the storm has stolen?

And this will predict the times these signs will bring
Me and my stupid heart
We were never apart
But now sugar won't work

Lightning up!
And fly the coop
Far from this tin-pan alley oop
Did you think I was your dupe?
I hear such lies and howlers
Words to pull out your molars

And this will predict the times these signs will bring
Me and my stupid heart
We were never apart
But now sugar won't work, sugar won't work

Lightning up!
Sugar the pill
A wall of ocean ten miles high
Metal darts torn from the sky
Like wanton boys make noise pull wings from flies

And this will predict the times these signs will bring
Me and my stupid heart
We were never apart
But now sugar won't work, (sugar won't work) [x5]",Sugar Won't Work
Elvis Costello,"Just because you don’t speak the language
Doesn’t mean that you can’t understand
Just because you don’t speak the language
Doesn’t mean that you can’t understand
The twist in the script of the insult
Scrawled on the back of your hand

Torn from the pages of scripture
Sprayed on the wall in the frays of a flag
Kisses forbidden on lips
And all of your fine clothes worn into rags

Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There’s a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire

Don’t open the door ‘cos they’re coming
Don’t open the door ‘cos they’re here
Above there’s an ominous humming
Below there’s a murmur of prayer

Torn from the pages of scandal
Sprayed on a wall in the frays of the flag
Kisses forbidden on lips
And all of your fine clothes blown into rags

Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There’s a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire

There’s a cross in the line there’s a circus
There’s a voice that you might overhear
There’s a lens making the picture perfect
They say you have nothing to fear

Torn from the pages of pamphlets
Thrown in the air like confetti in church
Far, far away there’s a target
And the sound of an army just starting to march

Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There’s a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire

Just because I don’t read the language
Doesn’t mean that I'm blind to the threat
Though I thought there was more to forgiveness
Than all we conveniently forget

Torn from the pages of history
Repeated again and again and again
You’re either for or against us
And that is how the hatred begins

Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire, tripwire
There’s a tripwire
Tripwire, tripwire, tripwire...",Tripwire
Elvis Costello,"Now there's a crank in every crowd
Sprinkling gunpowder
Seems that everything is about to blow
They lit the burning paper
With a waxen taper
Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row

And they're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
Watching the pipeline as it overflowed
Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row

He made a fortune out of barbed wire
In the last days of the Empire
Built a cast-iron curtain
Just to keep control

He was a tycoon, then a cheapskate
Went out looking for a keepsake
To tuck into his suitcase on Viceroy's Row

And they're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
Watching the pipeline as it overflowed
Sitting pretty here on Viceroy's Row

He had a satchel full of cash
And dishes full of ashes
He went from boom to bust
In the blinking of a lash

Heard the rat-a-tat of the late patrol
Shooting out the lights up on Viceroy's Row

And they're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
They're coming for him slowly
Now the war is over
Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row

The woman in a blindfold
She doesn't want her hand held
Walking through a minefield
Saying ""How does this feel?""
Stepping on the quicksand
Going down slow
Hiding up here on Viceroy's Row

Nothing satisfies
The ruins of his blue eyes
Like blood stains on a diamond mine
And deep within you felt
Not one measure of his guilt
Staring in the dark up on Viceroy's Row

Yet her penitent lover
Took a ribbon of rubber
Tied her to the bed made of silken thread

But without an ounce of mercy
They denounced him with a curse
Hammering on the door upon Viceroy's Row

Now his little concubine in her cemetery drag
Her face all smeared with charcoal
Is leaving all her cares, so
Take 500 acres and see what you can sow
We came to overthrow those on Viceroy's Row

They're gathering flowers
In the crack of hours where all of the nightmares go
Watching the pipeline as it overflowed
Sitting up here on Viceroy's Row",Viceroy's Row
Elvis Costello,"I've got this phosphorescent portrait of gentle Jesus meek and mild
 I've got this harlot that I'm stuck with carrying another man's child
 The solitary star announcing vacancy burnt out as we arrived
 They'd throw us back across the border if they knew that we survived
And they were surprised to see us
 So they greeted us with palms
 They asked for ammunition, acts of contrition and small alms

Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 I've got this imaginary radio, and I'm punching up the dial
 I've got the A.C. trained on the T.V. so it won't blow up in my eye
 And everything that I thought fanciful or mocked as too extreme
 Must be family entertainment here in the strange land of my dreams
 And I'm practicing my likeness of St. Francis of Assisi
 And if I hold my hand outstretched
 A little bird comes to me

 And I might recite a small prayer
 If I ever said them
 I lay down on an iron frame
 And found myself in Bedlam
 Stepping on the fingers that were stretching through the bars
 Wailing echoes down the corridors

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 They've got this scared and decorated girl strapped to the steel trunk of a Mustang
 They drove her down a cypress grove where traitors hang and stars still spangle
 They dangled flags and other rags along a colored thread of twine
 They dragged that bruised and purple heart along the road to Palestine

 Someone went off muttering, he mentioned thirty pieces
 Easter saw a slaughtering, each wrapped in bloodstained fleeces

My thoughts returned to vengeance but I put up no resistance
 Though I seemed a long way from my home
 It really was no distance

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
With a slap or a kiss
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this

 And the player piano picks out ""Life Goes On""
 The Ringtone rang out ""Jerusalem""
 Into the pit of sadness
 Where the wretched plunge
 We've buried all the Innocents
 We must bury revenge

 Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up
There must be something better than this
There must be something better than this
There must be something better than this

 In the name of the Father and the Son
In the name of Gasoline and a Gun
Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, wake me up",Wake Me Up

Trapped within a House of Feathers
Sitting in a Shirt of Wire
Howling at a Wall of Flowers
Saying ""Wise Up Ghost""

Slipped into the room like an assassin

For you and your King

Elvis Costello,"As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?
And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I want to know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
And as I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony.
'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me want to cry.
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh

Yo me moriré 

Con tu recuerdo 
Yo me voy a morir por ti 
Pedacito de mi vida, pedacito de mi vida 
Dueña de mi corazón, dueña de mis pensamientos 

Todavía no se me olvida, todavía no se me olvida 
Todavía no se me olvida cuando estamos contentos 
Ay! pedacito de mi vida, pedacito de mi vida 
Dueña de mi corazón dueña de mis pensamientos 

Yo no sé porque te fuiste, yo no se porque te fuiste 
Solo estoy sufriendo porque no estas a mi lado 
Si tu te vas yo no se que hacer 
Porque tu ya formas parte de mí 

Si es que te busco y no estas ahí 
Tenlo por seguro que yo 
Yo me moriré 
Yo sin tus besos 

Yo me moriré 
Tal vez por eso

Elvis Crespo,"Por un mirada tuya
Soy capas de cualquier cosa
Por un beso de esa boca
Sin pensarlo moriría

Por el solo rose de tu piel de terciopelo
Dejaría el firmamento sin estrellas
Me convertiría en un esclavo para siempre
Por una mirada tuya solamente

Por que fueras de mi mano
Un día de estos por la calle
Con la nubes de la tarde
Te dibujaría aun te amo

Sueño que un día de estos
Te detengas a escucharme
Para poder decirte lo que siento

Porque una noche de estas
La luna me sorprendieras
Con tu cabeza en mi hombro
Yo daría la vida entera

Sueño que un día de estos
Te detengas a escucharme
Para poder decirte lo que siento

Que yo estoy enamorado de tu voz
De tu sonrisa angelical
De tu forma de mirar

Que yo estoy dispuesto a todo
Por tu amor
Si tu abrieras de par en par
Las puertas de tu corazón

Que yo vivo

Yo podre volver a verte 
Necesito hablar contigo 
Y decirte lo que siento 

Aquella noche que nos vimos 
Todavía la recuerdo 
En mis suenos, fuiste un ángel 
Vi, que del cielo bajaba 
No podía despertarme 
Pues tus alas me abrazaban

Elvis Crespo,"Mi regalito, mi regalito
Tienes la magia que me
Llena, cuando me das un besito
Why aunque me regalan

Flores why claveles, eso no me llena
Mi mayor regalo es volver a tenerte
Prefiero tus labios, mios nuevamente
Tu eres mi nina

Por eso te digo, veo en tu mirar
Una said de amor, que me arrastra a tus pies
Why hay en tu besar, fuego clestial
Que domina mi ser

why con tu ternura, why con tu dulzura
Conozco el placer, de ese regalito
Que dios me ha dado, hoy en ti mujer
Why no quiero nada, que no sea amarte, por ser

Elvis Crespo,"Ya no quiero darte amor eterno 
Solo quiero echarme al mar 
Y una boquita en cada puerto 
Ya no quiero atarme al 
Mismo cuerpo 
Pero estoy amordazado 
Entre los besos de tu huerto 
Yo no quise darte las dos manos 
Ni trepar por los tejados 
Recogiendo el fruto del manzano 
Raras veces mata los ladridos 
Pero tu callada me has mordido 
 
Dame tiempo y bésame 
En la boca 
Y déjame la lengua rota 
Es mi pasatiempo 
Que yo no quiero darte amor eterno 
Ni beber para olvidar los palos 
De este casamiento 

Yo no quiero ahogarme en el infierno 
Pero tengo que abrazarte y 
Juro que sin ti reviento 
Yo no quise darte tantas flores 
Ni subirme a los balcones 
Pero me baje los pantalones 
Raras veces mata los ladridos 
Pero tu callada me has mordido",Bésame en la Boca

Elvis Crespo,"¿Cómo fingir que te olvide? 
Si por mas que intento sigues en mi mente 
¿Cómo he de sanar la herida que quedó en mi corazón? 
Solo de pensar que te perdí, duele 

Ya sucedió ¿Dónde fallé? 
Si mi motivo en esta vida era quererte 
Cuando duermo en las noches me imagino junto a ti 
Pero cuando me despierto, veo que no estás ahí 

Dime dónde yo me equivoqué 
Dime en qué momento te dejé de amar 
Sólo quiero qué escuches mis palabras 
Que llegan desde el fondo de mi alma 
Y aún sigo refugiado a tu almohada 
Que lleva el aroma de tu piel 
Y en ella llevo tantos dulces sueños, como lo fue ayer

Ya no eres la misma de ayer 
Dime donde se fueron 
Los suenos que yo te invente 
Ya no finjas, los ojos no saben

Como ves y esta claro 
Que lo que sentías por mi ya se fue 

Si no hay nada que hacer 
No te voy a insistir 
Es mejor que estés libre

Mas si aun vivo en ti, si algo queda 
De mi, moveré cielo y tierra 
Y haré lo que sea por no dejarte ir 

A medias no me sirve el 
Amor, a medias no me alcanza 
Para que quiero amar con locura y 
Pasión a quien ya no me ama 
A medias no me sirve el amor, 
A medias no me basta 
No te puedo engañar 
La verdad no te has ido 
Y ya me haces falta 

No te voy a negar 
Que me duele pensar que perdí, 
Pero aun la esperanza 
No ha muerto aquí dentro de mi, 
Y por eso te pido que aclares 
Nuestra situación 
No valdría lo pena seguir 
Si no nos amamos los dos 

Si no hay nada que hacer 
No te voy a insistir 
Es mejor que estés libre 
Y decidas que es lo mejor para ti

Que noche!, pequeña, échate pa'ca
Fue una noche donde en realidad
Tanto tu como yo la pasamos
Tan bien
Primero nos besamos
Nos acariciamos, nos cogió la noche

Que noche la de anoche
Que noche que pasamos!
Primero nos besamos
Y luego nos amamos
Que noche, y llenas de frio
Que noche donde fui tu abrigo
Yo al abrazarte, tu al calentarme
El chocar de los cuerpos era desesperante
Que noche de melodía, que noche de
Poesías, yo al hablarte, tu al escucharme,
Unidos a coros eran provocantes

Que noche, noche de suenos
Que noche donde fui tu dueño
Yo fui el tren y tu la vía, noche como la de
Anoche que nunca llegue el día

Que noche la de anoche
Que noche que pasamos!

Sudor se convirtieron en un manantial,
Un manantial donde nadamos y
Nadamos y ojala que se repita

Loco esa noche
Que se repita esa noche
De besos y abrazos, caricias
Que noche, que noche!
Fue una noche bonita;
Que noche, que noche
Donde tu fuiste mía;

Y si me dices que me quieres 
Puedo volver a empezar 

Dime si tú me puedes querer 
Dime si tú me puedes amar 
Dime si tú me puedes decir 
Que soy la única en ti 
Dime que tú me prometerás 
Que conmigo tú estarás 
Yo estoy segura que al fin 
Contigo seré feliz 

En vano no ha pasado este tiempo 
Hoy hemos aprendido que en la vida nada dura 
Como se puede ya confiar 
Que la felicidad espera una oportunidad 

Dime si tú me puedes querer 
Dime si tú me puedes amar 
Dime si tú me puedes decir 
Que soy la única en ti 
Dime que tú me prometerás 
Que conmigo tú estarás 
Yo estoy segura que al fin 
Contigo seré feliz

De relaciones pasadas marcadas 
Un poco mas de tiempo y yo estaré 
Preparada para escuchar

Dime que tú me prometerás 
Que conmigo tú estarás

Era tan fácil como ayer

Se esmeraba por darme 
Todo lo que yo necesitaba 
Y me di cuenta de que tan fácil no es

Ahora con gusto nos toca ayudarla, 
Y por mi vieja luchar hasta el fin, 
Por ella luchare hasta que me muera, 
Y por ella yo no quiero morir,

I've got a hostage and a hand grenade
Take me alive or take me dead
Just put a bullet through my head

As I go down
Down to the flats and into the sound
The closer I get to the city
The further I am from memory

For the words of the angry sun
'no one' when he says 'no one'
Yeah he means 'no one' 
No one
No one will survive
Ash Wednesday alive
No soldier no lover
No father no mother
Not a lonely child
In the up and in the bedroom
A black and white of the bride and the groon
Will bring me to my knees
With the colorized bad dream
That takes its place on 
Ash Wednesday

White noise and love
Will be my only drug
On this day nine 
Suns away 
From that sad sad Saturday
When fire my friend
Fire my villain
You take away yesterday
To give to me today
When nothing's free no now it's
Ash Wednesday

So each day is ash Wednesday
All this life is ash Wednesday

All the doors are shut
And the windows barely opened up
The fires all around
It's the ending of the drought
And we are ready now
For tear gas clouds

Come on fill the house
Finally and weep
For it's king and queen sleep

Elvis Perkins,"Jean Cocteau is covered in butter
The ghosts of Cappucino and Zaza hover
In the hallway where the devil and his lover
Beg you for change on the slide

There's nothing really like a French blues
Blown by an unknown soldier in you
To all your regrets and you rouse
I'll meet you down there when I try

And do you ever wonder
Where you go when you die?
Emile's Vietnam in the sky

Well, I'd take better care of your heart
You'll be opening a Sswiss bank account
Let go, it's over now, play your part
You'll be swinging those milk clouds on high

And do you ever wonder
Where you go when you die?
Emile's Vietnam in the sky

",Emile's Vietnam in the Sky
Elvis Perkins,"Come, lay here beside me
And I'll fear no death
I'll give you my body
And I'll breathe your breath

No-one will harm you
Inside this song
We will be safe here
As the light is long
That makes way for Good Friday

Get out of your body
For there goes your blood
It falls on my secrets
And colors the flood

The time of our fathers
Is not ours to kill
Their sad cellared wines
Are not ours to spill
And won't be passed over Good Friday

Though this life
Is Ash Wednesday
It's Ash Wednesday
It forever approaches Good Friday

",Good Friday
Elvis Perkins,"Stay if you want
There is enough
Sadness for the
Both of us

Follow the sound
To the table underground
There will be plenty
Tears goin' round

And I would be happy
For you to stay
With me 'til tomorrow
Can become today

In a sad world
In a sad world

But when you leave
By powders and my teas
Will speak
Their heads off to me

Here everyone knows
Their own name
In a sad world
No two are the same

Real soon, assures the spoon
Watch out!, says the time
Water, give me water
Remember me, begs the rhyme

Of a sad world
Of a sad world

",It's a Sad World After All
Elvis Perkins,"I heard a sound
When I was a child
Someone was walking through the pillow that night
The snow muted 
The pitch of night
A shadow approached across a field in white
It's only me
It's only me
And the sound of my heart it startled me
As I drifted
From the dark room
Face lifted from the paper moon
Reflected in the orbit bath
He manages to say before he starts to laugh
You can't always trust
The darkness and the dust
But me, I'm just a man
It's more than I can understand
It's only me

The white noise
Falls away
To reveal the perfect day
Where roses bloomed
Out of thin air
And music rose from down the buried stairs
It's only mine
It's only mine
I grew it in the shade
When the sun couldn't shine
And at times I don't know why
The tears come to my eyes
And what if I go blind
As they flow out of my mind
It worries me
It worries me
That there's someone on my mind
Who I don't see
I close my eyes to disappear
Into the fields of stars between my ears
The dark 
As they overlap
We follow one another 
As we fade to black

It's only night
It's only night

An ultrasound when I was alive
The shadows go spying on the ones in the wild
They dip their arrows
Into the sea
They wash their arms 
As they wait for me
They wait for me
They wait for me
Hey wait for me
Hey wait for me",It's Only Me
Elvis Perkins,"Well, I don't care, your cameras caught me crying as I left your gates
Or that your maintenance men, they caught our last embrace
Well, you were on the verge of tears when I first knew I would know you
And now your ancient black tears, they stain your robe

Calypso will come with me on that morning April day
To the city of my childhood in a cage
On the broad back of the earth we will drive twelve hours straight
And we'll take turns feeling crazy and okay

On May Day, May Day, listen for the sound
Of the ambulances singing rounds drowning out the blue
Well the Captain of America he sings through his toothpaste
And the bubbles of his words will float away
As he gargles out a hymn in the funny fish voice way
And all the sorrow seems to go away

On May Day, May Day, listen for the sound
Of the Geiger counters counting down
To one and blast off baby to the inter-space of stars
Out to the star encrusted boulevard

On May Day, May Day, can you hear the sound
Of the megaphones calling out instructions
And I need your quiet empire where forgetful Persians roam
And with two hands full of silver I'll go home
Return me to my kingdom where my children wait for me
To build them flying saucers

On May Day, May Day, they are going down
Send the fleet of black-and-whites wailing downtown

May Day, May Day, May Day

",May Day
Elvis Perkins,"And now the night and the liquor wear off
I see your sister more clear
Now that the sun has warmed the sky

Won't you sleep, my lady
Go to sleep baby
No I can't sleep now, baby

It's true, I loved her then, yes
And you deserve far better than this mess
It's true, I loved her then, forever

Now the night and the liquor coming on
I hardly see your sister
Now that the stars own the sky

No, I won't come back, baby

Elvis Perkins,"While you were sleeping your babies grew
The stars shined and the shadows moved
Time flew the phone rang
There was a silence when the kitchen sang
Its songs competed like kids for space
We stared for hours in our maker?s face
They gave us picks said ""go mine the sun
And go gold and come back when you're done""
Uh oh

While you were sleeping you tossed you turned
You rolled your eyes as the world burned
The heavens fell the earth quaked
I thought you must be but you weren't awake, no
You were dreaming you ignored the sun
You grew your power garden for your little ones
And you found brides for them on Christmas Eve
They hung young Cain from the Adam trees
And danced uh oh
While you were sleeping I tossed and I turned too
I closed my eyes but the future burned through
The planet turned a hair grey as I relived the day

While you were sleeping the money died
Machines were harmless and the earth sighed
The wind you swept sound and gravity brought my love
Around
The oceans rose sang about decay
The witches flew and the mermaids stayed
Full of dreams you overslept
In keeping with the quiet through the walls I crept
I walked on tip-toes sent darkness swirling over all
The kitchen
In the early morning
Uh oh uh oh


I'll never catch up to you who sleep so sound
My yawns are useless my heart beats too loud
To go to sleep my mind's too proud to bow out
While you were sleeping the time changed
All your things were rearranged
Your vampire mirrors face to face
They saw forever out into space and found you dreaming
In black and white
While it rained in all the colors of the night
Uh oh uh oh

I watched the tv?s memories champion ships vanish to sea
Can it be my honey between you and me
So I waited for the riddled sky to be solved again by
Sunrise
And I made a death soup for life
For my father?s ill widowed wife
Did you have that strangest dream before you woke
'Cause in your gown you had the butterfly stroke
Did it escape you like some half-told joke
When you reached for your plume of smoke

And it'll haunt you my honey bee
Anyone who's anyone has that same dream
Were you falling were you flying and were you calling
Out or were you dying
But thank god you're up now let's stay this way
Else there'll be no mornings and no more days
'Cause when we?re dreaming the babies grow
The stars shine and the shadows flow
Time flies the phone rings there is a silence
When everybody tries to sing
Uh oh uh oh",While You Were Sleeping

The echoing mountains hum along

And have matador stew for his dinner

And it was true love at first sight
Her red cape was waving but Pedro was shaking (or shaving?)
He wanted to date her that night

First time the love bug had bitten
He once was a mad bull, a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten

Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

So one night, when no-one was on sight
The matador, went to finish the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bull...and they fought once more

When they found the matador and saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro

The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame

Who makes my temperature rise?
Who makes me tremble with wonderful rapture

A creature too wild to tame
Then suddenly I saw, Marguerita
And I was caught, like a moth in the flame

A slave to her every command
She captivates me, and intoxicates me
With one little touch of her hand

Though I thirst for your lips, night and day
Is your love a mirage that will fade away?

And that hourglass, runs too fast no doubt

Listen, to the wisdom of the ages
These words, can be found in history's pages

Live each day, for happiness can't wait
And love while you may, but heed the hand of fate
If the finger points, it's too late no doubt
For the sands of time, are running out
But the man who turns, and escapes somehow

Is the wisest of men
And to such a man, I'd bow

Nuzzle her muzzle

You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me

The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles",Drums of the Islands

And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach

Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart

You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart it's cold as ice

Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money? I do

Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worryin' about their income tax
Why waste time on high financin'?
I'd rather spend it on good romancin'

What if my pockets are empty as can be?

Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money? Not me

When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep

Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money? Not me
What do you want?

I want a big yacht I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two

Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality

To prove it's you that I've been thinking of
Tear up all the pictures I own of every pretty girl I've ever known

I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop

If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can

Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do

I held you so tight
You were out of my sight

Night people hear the call
From hidden alleys, secret rendezvous
They come out one and all

The city by night I'm wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake

Whatever sets off the spark
A magic glow lights the dark
Then I'm intrigued by the sight
Of the city by night

Those crowded nightclubs
Those picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one forgets
And I'm enchanted, music softly plays
By dancing silhouettes

The city by night I'm wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake

The evening's full of surprise
It's magic opens my eyes
And I'm intrigued by the sight
Of the city by night

Driving wagons, cars and jeeps

Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot, the nights are cold

Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the night wings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done

And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need

By deprivation of temptation

Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad

It's give and take and he does all the taking

""Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon?""

About the way we learned to live and if we said our prayers

Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces

I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd 
And I would be stranger no more

At a quarter to eleven

That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before

Because the stranger in the crowd

It hurts my little children so I wonder

Long before the human race
Something stirred

A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the world

Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness

Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life

Daylight came from in the night
And all was good

Life became a master plan
Love produced the perfect man

Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day

From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life

Oh, the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow

Well, the fires of hell began to burn
And so he sent his chosen son
To let us know

That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall

I love more and more

Oh, we could fly right up to the sky
The things we've been dreaming of
And how real they would seem
A midsummer-night's dream
Can't you see that tonight's so right for love?

We'll be together, and love forever
Nothing can change our destiny

I knew the moment I kissed you, couldn't resist you
Together we belong

You'll always be.

Elvis Presley,"We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been.

We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
We were just outsiders looking in.

We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin.

And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way",Almost
Elvis Presley,"Now once it was told to me
We're born with a magic key
It opens the door to miracles of spring

It takes you to wishing wells
To ice cream and carousels
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing

Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy
Have a happy, warm smiling face
I start believin', in believin'
Let your address, be sunshine place

There's love and there's joy I'm told
Much more than your heart can hold
It's there like the ring you would grab
On a merry-go-round

The world isn't half as gray
With friends on a rainy day
But people keep away, when you wear a frown

And I know what it's like when you feel left out of the game little one
But if you take this helping hand that I lift
Then we can smile together, let's be friends
The world that you see may seem to be a mystery to you
The night may be dark but hope very hard and dreams can come true
You live in silence but for once let's pretend
We're talking here together, let's be friends
You're not alone, I've always known that we'd get along
And someone I know says life is good and He can't be wrong
There's fun and laughter just waiting round the bend
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Let's find them now together, let's be friends

Elvis Presley,"If you let the stars keep telling you
Who to love and not to love
You may never find contentment for your heart
You could go unloved forever and darling that means never
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
You say that stars have promised you true love ten thousand times
But here you are with a broken heart and mind
I can tell you want to love me from the beating in your heart

Let's forget about the stars, come follow me my dove

Elvis Presley,"I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel'
Some call it folk, some call it soul
People let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat
I was made for rock and roll

I thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it Lord it takes me home

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to his country songs
While I was in the back room rockin' on 

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat

Elvis Presley,"I look at you and wham, I'm head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell

One crazy kiss and bam, I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell

I never thought I'd get tricked 
By you sweet talking lies
You've got a bag of tricks
And when you get busy
I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks

My knees are weak, my head is spinning around

Elvis Presley,"When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep
Elvis Presley,"Never know how much I love you

Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know

Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when they kiss you

that's exactly what Id do
I would travel night and day

Or that could keep me away from you

They only told me we were parting
Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me.

How could I help it?
Tears were starting.
Good-bye to golden nights 
Beside the silvery seas.

I long to hold you dear,
And kiss you just once more.

Here come the teardrops, bitter they are, harder they fall
She caught me lying, then she caught a train
And I caught a fever walking home in the rain

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow

But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ava there for me

And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to me",Danny Boy

Tomorrow for old england she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine

For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war i know so very well
Even now i see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
My ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should i return home safe again to england
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, i have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell",The Last Farewell

Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid

That he couldn't see love coming down

Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed

Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world

That he couldn't see love going down

Would just be wasted if you leave me

Never thought that I'd travel all alone
The trail of memories

Happy hours, lonely years
But I guess I can't complain
For I still recall the Summer sun
Through all the Winter rain

The fire of love, the fire of love
Can burn from afar
And nothing can light the dark of the night
Like a falling star
Summer kisses, Winter tears
Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights
With dreams of yesterday

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless,
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Whithout question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm

That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage

Elvis Presley,"The words of her promise
The flame of her faith
The love that would never drift away
Where did they go, Lord, where did they go?

You know somehow forever
Slipped out of my hands
And my dreams ran away with the wind
Where did they go, Lord, where did they go?

You know sometimes I wish
I had lost her to another
Well, but, Lord, she just walked off all alone
But all that is within me is the bitter just ending
And bewildered because her love is gone

Oh, the passion I trusted
The truth that I leaned on
And the hope that would forever keep me strong
I cry out my questions
Oh, the answers are all gone

Elvis Presley,"When I think of how He came so far from glory
Came to dwell among the lowly such as I
To suffer shame and such disgrace
On Mount Calvary take my place
Then I ask myself this question
Who am I?

Who am I that The King would bleed and die for
Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord
The answer I may never know
Why He ever loved me so
But to that old rugged cross He'd go
For who am I?

When I'm reminded of His words
I'll leave Him never
If you'll be true I'll give to you life forever
Oh I wonder what I could have done
To deserve God's only Son
To fight my battles until they're won
For who am I?

Who am I that He would pray not my will, Thy Lord

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend

While life goes on around him everywhere

And through the night, his sleepless nights

And by himself it's easy to pretend

I'm gonna shake it up

Fool about my money don't try to save

Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
And I'm feelin' fine

Elvis Presley,"It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home

I have been away from her now for a long time
And I've lived a life I thought that it should be
It's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
And the waiting 'round is really killing me

It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time, oh Lord, before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again; it's a matter of time

I think I'll take a train right early in the morning
Just to see how far I get along the way
But the trains don't run too often, only sometimes
So I guess I'd better wait another day

It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home

Pardon me, if I'm sentimental

Now and then there's a fool such as I (fool such as I)
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you

You taught me how to love
And now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you dear

Elvis Presley,"Are you lonesome tonight,
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day

When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?

Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
I wonder if you`re lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world`s a stage
And each must play a part.

Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange

And why I`ll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I`d rather go on hearing your lies

Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I`m standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won`t come back to me

Then make them bring the curtain down.
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?",Are You Lonesome Tonight? [Laughing Version]

Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving

I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need

When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do

Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving
Gotta find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out

I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay
If you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go
I can't take another minute of a day without you in it
If you love me, let it be. If you don't then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me lovin' you
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello, it's good to see you
Anytime I turn around to find you there
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see?
You now you have whatever's mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be
 
If you love me let me know. If you don't then let me go

Elvis Presley,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight

Fever all through the night

Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when they kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever

'cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple

I was minding my own business
But drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau

Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow

And twilight trimmed in purple haze

Elvis Presley,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.
The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,
She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side.

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

The cadillac moved to a hundred and four
Got hot and wouldn't do no more
It got cloudy and started to rain
Tooted my horn in the passing lane
The rain water blowin all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor no good

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

Maybellene, why can't you be true?

You've started back doing the things you used to do.

The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound.
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill.

It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're movin' on the back roads

And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads

And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way

Why her mom and dad are not together

Elvis Presley,"In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my -pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
Well I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high

She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain",Early Morning Rain
Elvis Presley,"The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies, my love
To the dark and the empty skies

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command

The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands

To wake up to my destiny 
It's time to face reality

I lie in the darkness thinking I must go before it's light
Before you open up your eyes and you beg me to stay
I'll leave 'cause I can't stand to see you hurt this way
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Though I knew the time was coming and our love would end somehow
I just couldn't bear to tell you exactly just when or how
I know we can't go on, that it was wrong to start
But if you wake up crying now, you know you'll break my heart
Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Sleep my love as I kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you, kiss you, kiss you goodbye
Then I won't hear the sound of your cry

Ohhhh, Sleep my love as I kiss you

",The Sound of Your Cry
Elvis Presley,"Are you lonesome tonight,
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down.

Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?",Are You Lonesome Tonight?

Where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so

Till then my heart will be beyond the reef

Datin' means acting in a silly way
Datin' makes girls start wiggle walking
Datin' makes a guy start baby talking

Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids I've found
You'd think they belong in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
'Cause some day you'll be datin' too

Datin' makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Datin' makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
And just because it's so much fun to make up

Children can't wait to grow up but then
They're datin and they're acting like kids again

long before the human race,
Something stirred,
A vast and timeless source began,
Intelligence was born and then,
there was the world,
Powers filled the universe,
matter formed and broke the curse,
Of nothingness,
Love became an ageless soul,
nature reached her highest goal,
And breathed the breath of life,
Everlasting life.

Well creatures come from out of sight,
Daylight came from in the night,
and all was good,
Life became a masterplan,
Love produced the perfect man,
that understood,
The image of the makers word,
worshipped him with all he had,
But then one day,
From in the depths an evil seed,
grew and manufactured greed,
That changed the way of life,
Everlasting life,

Oh the loving power looked and saw,
Inside the heart of man a flaw,
began to grow,
Well, the fires of hell began to burn,
and so he sent his chosen son,
To let us know,
That love had surely made us all,
and hate would surely make us fall,
So from the cross,
Well he showed the world that dreadful day,
That love could be the only way,
or all is lost of life,
Everlasting life,
For life is love,
And love is life.

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day 
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Cause it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back,
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way

My woman got tired of heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time.",You Gave Me a Mountain

Elvis Presley,"King Creole
There's a man in New Orleans
Who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man
With a great big soul
He lays down a beat
Like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

When the king starts to do it
It's as good as done
He holds his guitar
like a Tommy gun
He starts to growl
From way down his throat
He bends a string
And that's all she wrote

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about meat and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole

Well, he plays something evil
Then he plays something sweet
No matter what he plays
You got to get up on your feet

When he gets the rockin' fever
Baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playin'
'Till his guitar breaks

You know he's gone, gone, gone

But I've never ran

And the night won't set me free 
But I don't let the evening get me down 
Now that you're around me 

And you love me, too 
Your thoughts are just for me 
You set my spirits free 
I'm happy that you do

And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me

In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

Elvis Presley,"Six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called love

It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy a livin' to worry about a thing called love

And then I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called love.",A Thing Called Love

Elvis Presley,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell.
I let it ring for a long, long spell.
I went to the window,
I peeped through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind.
He said,

Money, honey.
Money, honey.
Money, honey, if you want to get along with me.

Well, I screamed and I hollered,
I was so hard-pressed.
I called the woman that I loved the best.
I finally got my baby about half past three,
She said I'd like to know what you want with me.
I said,

Money, honey.

Elvis Presley,"When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep, he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
""I can do no more for him, Jim""

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side and looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep, he has gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep [Alternate Take][#]

Elvis Presley,"Hear that old train whistle
Howling in the night
If that flyer's southbound
Everything will be all right

I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now,
I'm gonna get back home somehow

Don't nobody tell me
Baby's been untrue
If she's been unfaithful
I don't know what I'll do

I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow

Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could , now I know

The sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye

I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky back road
I've loved you much too long
My love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong
Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through

With the rain in my shoes (rain in my shoes)
Searchin' for you
In the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain
Showed your photograph
To some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a gen'ral store
They said ""yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday?
No, wait, the day before?

Finally got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""
As we drove on through the rain
As he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through

If tomorrow wasn't such a long time

Then I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name

If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me

There'd be no birds,
No planes to sail in the blue
Without his wondrous eyes
To see them through

They say God made land
And He gave it all to man
This I know is mighty, good and true
There is no God, but God

And He knows everything to do
So just you call on Him
And He will share His love with you",There Is No God But God
Elvis Presley,"Once I stood in the night
With my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried
Oh Lord, don't hide your face from me

Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone

Hold my hand all the way
Every hour, every day
Come here to the great unknown

Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone",Where No One Stands Alone
Elvis Presley,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me Lord? [Live]

Without Him I?d surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting

Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I?d be enslaved
Without Him life would be worthless
But with Jesus thank God I'm saved

Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Do you know Him today
Please don't turn Him away
Oh Jesus, my Jesus
Without Him how lost I would be
Without Him how lost I would be",Without Him

Kissin's allowed 'cause we're proud to be cousins

What's a little teasin', huggin' and a-squeezin'

Between us cousins.

Oh it's so great to be one big family

And we show it, yes we show it

You see, we never feud, we're a happy brood

Folks all know it, yes they know it

Honey we dress and we mess

I'm just a smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills i love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above

The closer and closer i get to home
The more excited i am
Those were the mornings i'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam

[Chorus]

I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How i long to be with them following the hounds
A-huntin' again
Gettin' me a big old grizzly bear

[Chorus]

I traveled around and met lots of girls
No matter how many i see
I left some pretty ones behind
I know back home is where i'll find
The girl whose love is meant for me

Elvis Presley,"Ten thousand miles even though I roam
I can hear the call of the hills of home
The canyons high and the valleys low
Echo ""how can you stay away""

Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me ""how can you stay away""

Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
Now, now I know I must go
Where the hills say ""don't stay away""

Elvis Presley,"We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been

We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
But we were just outsiders looking in

We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin

And if it's true you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way",Almost [Undubbed Version][#]

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more?

This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day to shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me, there is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun that rises over the land
I watch you walk away; how come I have to let you go?
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel, you might return and yet
There are so many times that people have to love and then forget
Oh, there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say it's over

So I turn my back, turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence tying not to think at all
I set my feet before me, walk the silent street before me
Now it's over

You made the bed your sleeping in
And I'm tired of hearing about it friend

Elvis Presley,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""No, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way [Master][#]

And it looks somethin' like a turnip green

Pick her a mess of it

Lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
Because her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Everyday before supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack

Because her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
