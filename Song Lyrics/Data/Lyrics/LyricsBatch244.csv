Kenny Loggins,"I see a lion captive in the kitchen
Rolling thunder rumbles down the hall
Once in awhile, everyone paces the floor
Lately, it's more and more
Love, if yu must be started go easily on your way
Still I wonder could it wait another day?

Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?
Is the answer just another road to go?
Does it have to leave to be?
Can it stay and be with be with me?
When will it last enough to have it here at home?

Too many roads are needlessly divided
By silent walls we build along the way
Why be alone to learn that your life has more?
That's what our love is for
Tear down those angry walls. I'll walk with you where you go
Still, you're the only one who'll ever know

Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?
Is the answer just another road to go?
Does it have to leave to be?
Or can it stay and be with me?
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?
When will it last enough to have it here at home?



",Will It Last
Kenny Loggins,"Day is done and night is calling
From the window light is falling
Shadows spinning on the walls
And dancing in the light

And 'round the door the kids are playing
Like June bugs into the light
And it seems like I'm looking at a mighty good time
All alone tonight

Hands a-clapping, voices singing
Tambourines and guitars ringing
Echoes through the willows
Bringing music to the night

And in the wind the whippoorwill's crying
Cold and all alone
And I am standing outside of a mighty good time
All alone tonight

Well, I can't recall when Louisiana music
Ever sounded so sweet
Just listen to the fiddle playing
'Bonaparte's Retreat'

Well, I just can't take no more
I gotta make it through that door
And dance until the break of day
As long as there's still music playing
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight

Well, I just can't take no more
I gotta make it through that door
And dance until the break of day
As long as there's still music playing
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight
",All Alone Tonight
Kenny Loggins,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Kenny Loggins,"I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

I'm alright
Don't nobody worry 'bout me
You got to gimme a fight
Why don't you just let me be

Do what you like,
Doing it nat'rally
But if it's too easy
They're gonna disagree

It's your life
And isn't it a mystery
If it's nobody's bus'ness
It's everybody's game

Gotta catch you later
No, no, cannonball it right away

Get it up and get you a job

Kenny Loggins,"I like the love
And I like the peaceful
I wish everyone I know could
Stand in the heartlight

I hold the hand
I walk with the teacher
We welcome in the mornin'
Singing together

Can you feel the love that's in my heart
Can you see the flame we got to start
Burnin' like a beacon in the night

Oh, oh and I'll light a candle
And then we'll dance it in the moonlight
Until the sunrise

",Heartlight
Kenny Loggins,"Maybe it's true what they say about it
Maybe we can't make the ends meet
Maybe we'll all have to do without it
Maybe this world's just incomplete

Still we all look for truth in our lives
Searching from different sides
If it's so hard living in a desperate world
But we all do the best that we can

Some people dream a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun

Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try

Maybe there's too much to think about
Maybe there just ain't nothing left to say
But if our time's really running out
Then this is no time to run away

'Cause we're destined to look for truth in this life
Blinded by tearful eyes
If it's no use trying in a desperate world
Then tell me, why was I born?

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun

Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try

Lonely, living so lonely
Is it too late
To turn it all around?

Some people dream a change
Some will remain the same
All of us live their lives
Under the gun

Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say, I gotta try

I gotta change
The world just remains the same
All of us live our lives
Under the gun

Someone's sleeping
Someone's giving up

Someone's trying
Someone's crying out
Still we live under the gun
",I Gotta Try
Kenny Loggins,"What you thinkin' of?
Darlin', you've been with me every day
But you seem so far away, I know
No, it's never enough
To smile and say there's something on your mind

If you doubt my love
Know that it's here all the time
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know

And if there is somethin' more
Girl, I'll give you anything you want
Girl it's been so right
Nobody could ever love you more

I've never been more sure
Where in the middle of the night
I hold you near
And take your heart in my arms

Swearin' all my love
That's something you've known from the start
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know

And if there is somethin' more
I'll give you anything you want
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know

Know that you're free to go
Just be sure that what you want
Is not what you got

Hold me, oh, hold me tonight
Forever, here, my love
So you'll never fly away

Gotta work it out
I'm tryin' to hold on to our romance
We've only got one more chance I know
So tell me what it's all about

Oh, darlin', if there's still a way to your heart
I'll use all my love to keep us from fallin' apart
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know

And if there is somethin' more
I'll give you everything you want
If that's not what you're lookin' for
If it's not what you need to know

Know that you're free to go
Just be sure that what you want
Is not what you got
",If It's Not What You're Looking For
Kenny Loggins,"When the feeling isn't right?
They say, you see it in a lover's eye
But I'm wide awake tonight
'N I'm looking for a reason why

It doesn't show
Still somehow, I know
Tell me that it just ain't so
Say, I made the whole thing up

It must be imagination
Why can't I forget it?
God, you'd think I'd know better

It must be imagination
Gone completely out of my mind
It must be imagination
Tearin' me apart

'N breakin' my heart
You can say what is real
You can tell me if I'm in a dream
'Cause I know what I feel

But I don't know what to believe
Turn on the night light
Even if it takes us all night
I gotta be sure by daylight
If I've made this whole thing up

It must be imagination
Tell me if I'm right
'Cause it's changing my life
It must be imagination
Everybody knows
There ain't no way to fight it

It must be imagination
Breakin' my heart
'N tearing me apart
If I'm only dreamin'

Then I'm cryin' in my sleep
You should be shakin' me
Why ain't you wakin' me up?

It must be imagination
God, I must be losin' my mind
It must be imagination
Does anybody know
Is there anyway to fight it?

It must be imagination
All in my mind, all in my mind
It must be imagination
If you wanna go, I just got to know

It must be imagination
Ooh, tell me what's the problem
Why you wanna go on breakin' my heart?
",It Must Be Imagination
Kenny Loggins,"I've always said that I believe anything can happen
Lately I've been wonderin' if that's really true
For a boy, time can be a lovely dance
Then suddenly the music can fade
Leave the man alone and dreamless

Till he only sees that he's used up all his chances after all
'Til now only a miracle could do to save the man I've turned into
Won't somebody let me know, where's my miracle

Love, it always seemed so easy
Just like a child who plays with imaginary friends
I could see the face of someone I believe
But only in the words of a song
Then she came along and got me dreamin'

That's when you began and when I held you, I held a miracle in my hands
'Til now only a miracle could do, I've found the boy I was in you
You've come to let me know there are miracles

And now only a miracle could do what I have finally found in you
I've come to let you know I believe that
Miracles can happen in the end
",Only a Miracle
Kenny Loggins,"I can't tell you 'bout the future
I wouldn't even swear about the past
One thing I know for certain
That's when your heart stops hurting
Falling in love, caught up with me at last

Always knew it would, never had it so good
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away
In my heart, I know it's right
By the way that I'm sleepin at night

People say that love ain't easy
Find a little love and let it dawn
One thing I know for certain
It'll make your heart stop hurting
Falling in love, caught up with me at last

Always knew it would, never had it so good
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away
In my heart, I know it's right

I was out there, all on my own
And just a smile is all I was after
And then you filled my world up with laughter
What a wonderful life
I never saw it so beautiful

Oh-oh-wo-oh what a wonderful life

Always knew it would, never had it so good
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away
In my heart, I know it's right

Always knew it would, never had it so good
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away
In my heart, I know it's right",At Last
Kenny Loggins,"Now, while we're here alone
And all is said and done
Now I can let you know
Because of all you've shown
I've grown enough to tell you
You'll always be inside of me

How many roads have gone by
So many words left unspoken
I needed to be by your side
If only to hold you

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And even when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever

Once, I dreamed that you were gone
I cried out trying to find you
I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me
But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
the love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And know that when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever in my heart
You always thought I'd be
I'd be yours
Forever",Forever

A gift we were given, within each other's dreams
We lived in the gardens of Avalon
Together, believed that we could live there forever
Then it faded away
Forgetting, we wandered too far from the land we'd known

Of all the lonely people, you're among the lucky few

It's never as easy to return
But if you're willing to go on
We'll find a way back to Avalon

They had it, it wasn't far away or imagined
He held her in his arms and planned it all
The towers of Avalon
They warned him, he only turned around for a moment
And everything had changed
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away

All the lonely people, you're among the lucky few
If it comes even once in a life

And when you come to know the miracle, it's mystical
When someone else's heart is in your hand
I learned too late, now I must try and find a way back home, ohh

Here is a lesson hard to learn
It's never as easy to return
But if you're willing to go on
We'll find a way back to Avalon

Kenny Loggins,"Found your picture in an old coat
And the ghost stirred deep inside.
All this time and I still feel the cold
From the madness in my pride.
Don't know why you ended it that way
I would've thought that you would tell
Me to my face

CHORUS
Color me blue on blu
Color me sadness without you.
Color me blue on blue
And I will wear it well.
I will wear it well.

Painted someone from a vision.
You saw the future in his eyes.
I know that wasn't how you pictured me.
You stole my hope, now I'll never know why.
Two hearts who began to beat as one.
I guess you scared yourself
And now you're on the run.

Come back my darlin'
Come back to me

Lookin' to find a time to become.

Holding the moment in their eyes.

Once I met a man who knew where he was goin'
And let everybody tag along.
But suddenly love had another plan.
Shook him and took him by the hand.

Believes that he's in danger
He'll never give up without a fight.

There's no way to lose

I know somethin' about love;
you gotta want it bad.
If that girl's (boy's) got into your blood, 
go out and get her (him).
If you want her (him) to be the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe,
here's the thing to do:
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta show it and make her (him) 
see that the moon up above, reach out and get it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
and if you want her (him) to only think of you,
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
Ever since the world began, 
it's been that way for man, and women 
were created to make love their destiny.
Then why should true love be so complicated?
Oh yeah, uh huh!
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta take it and show her (him) what the world's made of.
One kiss will prove it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
take her (him) hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride and 
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.

Kenny Loggins,"Where are the dreams that we once had?
This is the time to bring them back.
What were the promises caught
On the tips of our tongues?

Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart.

And down your streets I've walked alone,
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose,
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm so tired of living this life,
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart.

One with the Earth, with the sky
I believe we'll survive
If we only try
How long must we wait to change

This world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive,
And to be forgiven?
It's been too many years of talking now.

Isn't it time to stop somehow?
Air that's too angry to breathe
Water our children can't drink
You've heard it hundreds of times

You say you're aware, believe and you care, but
Do you care enough
To talk with conviction of the heart?",Conviction of the Heart
Kenny Loggins,"Love, where are we going,
And when do we reach the promise on the horizon,

Out on the ocean, under a sunset,
I was invited to come out and play a while
with magic and move a mountain.

Has anyone ever captured the sun,
Is the eagle ever truly tame,
Given just a little time,
I know that you'll find a way.

I would do anything for you,
Give up the world I've made me
And take you away,
I swear from now on,
The trust in my heart,
The vision of you in my life

My love,
I will be faithful,
but how can I make a promise
to a place I've never been?

Something has taken me off,
and I don't know if I will survive.
I believe that everything
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.

How can you fly,
keeping heaven in sight,
blinded by the light of day?

Given just a little time,
I know that I'll find a way

I would do anything for you,
Listen with all of my spirit,
for ecstasy calling,
You know I believe,
Cause all I have seen,
From the mountain,
The view from the heart.

I would do anything for you,
Give up the world I've made me
And take you away,
I swear from here on,
The trust in my god,
The vision of you in my life

Freedom is mine,
One beat at a time,
Where are we going,
I just don't know yet,
How will we make it,
I just can't say,
All that I know is that we've finally sailed away.

Seems everyone's made a prison of love,
But if anybody can escape,
Given just a little time,
I know that we'll find a way.

Like you, except in my dreams,
All my songs are for you,
I finally see my dreams come true.

I've never been so afraid,
That love is just a dream,
Darling I'll awake and you'll be gone,
Never believe that I'll love somebody,
I'll love somebody, someone like you,
I'll love somebody, I could love somebody.

You're too early for the sun,
Too early for the moon,
Too early for the rain,
Coming down on you,
You make me feel so close to home,
So far away, like nowhere else I've never been.

You're just too early for the stars,
Too early for the wind,
Too early for my heart,
To open up again.

But when I see you I just laugh,
And I believe, I'm right where I'm supposed to be.

Ooh, Darling, welcome to the wind,
As we sail our ship of dreams into uncharted waters,
Forget about the stars, and love will lead you higher,
So girl, let's ride the wind.

Surrender to the sun,
Surrender to the moon,
Surrender to the rain,
Surrender to the stars,
Surrender to your heart,
Surrender to the wind.
Take a chance,
Open up, let me love again.

Surrender to the sun,
Surrender to the moon,
Surrender to the rain,
Surrender to the stars,
Surrender to your fears,
Surrender to your tears,
Take a chance,
Open up, let me love again.",Too Early for the Sun

Will take you home again,
The journey home has just begun by friend,

The magic in your eyes,

And I surrender time and time again,

The will of the wind, child
The wind in the wind chimes,
Takes you home again.

What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me

You and I must start to realize
Blindness binds us in a false disguise
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes?

Kenny Loggins,"Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to owl and eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood

So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

Help me If you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Itâ´s hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going
I swear that old bear whispered, 'boy, welcome home'

Believe me if you can I've finally come

Further and further from things that we've done,
Leaving them one by one.
And we have just begun watching the river run.
Listening, learning and yearning to
Run, river, run.
Winding and swirling and dancing along,

Where lovers caress as we sing of our song,
Twisting together when we greet the sea.

Cast her wild wings over water and cloud

That's the way it's gonna be little darling
We'll go riding on the horses
Way up in the sky little darling
If you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

You will grow until you go
I'll be right there by your side
Even then a whispering wind
Will call me to you in the night
I hear all the people of the world
In my one bird's cry
I see them trying every way they know
To make their spirits fly

Can you see her moonlight in her eye
Coming from under my wing
You were born to fly

And the last lion roars, at the last dusty fountain
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn
They will stare unbelieving
At the Last Unicorn

When the first breath of winter, through the flowers is icing
And you look to the north, and a pale moon is rising
And it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn
In the distance hear her laughter
It's the Last Unicorn
I'm alive I'm alive

When the last moon is cast, over the last star of morning
And the future is past, without even a last desperate warning
Then look into the sky where through, the clouds a path is formed
Look and see her how she shimmers, it's the Last Unicorn

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side
Rainbow's are visions
They're only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some chose to
Believe it
But I know they're wrong wait and see

Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us star gazing
What so we think we might see

Someday we'll find it
That Rainbow Connection
The lovers the dreamers and me

Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices
I've heard them calling my name
Are these the sweet sounds that called
The young sailors
I think they're one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
There's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it

You built a present perfect world
And you may wonder to yourself
Does anyone really know what else could ever matter?

But the Man with His hand
On the hammer
Wears a velvet glove

Does the rich man know he's poor?
Does the beggar care for much more than survival?

Do you remember who you were?
Or who you are?

Love is nothing if not freedom

A new language I wish to speak

To translate my heart and my vision
To my beloved and his children
To all who come to sit at our table
Or walk with us through the market place
Or pray with us by the water

May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel
Or why there is pain,
If the answers are mine to know.
And if they are, I ask the Spirit to let me share them
With a light heart, with laughter,
Wth no expectation, with humility
But for the grace of Thee, go I.
May I know my innocence
Every moment of every day
May I be a child forever
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love
By my own communication to the Spirit.
May my aliveness always be as loud
When I make love, as when I cry
May I see my own reflection in the mirror
And smile

You are my teacher
And I surrender to your heart

No act of love can satisfy

To ask yourself the question
""How can love survive?""

And if we try and it don't work out
Like so many people do
It's just a fact of life, no we ain't in charge
There ain't nothin' that's wrong with me
Ain't nothin' that's wrong with you

Love's got nothin' to prove, it's not up to you
Two souls come into a world made
Of time and space, searchin' for the truth
With nothin' but love to prove
And find it in the gift of a moment of grace

Your heart is broken
'Cause your love was untrue
You're asking God
""Oh, why you?""

Oh, was it crazy
Givin' all of you?
You ask yourself the question
""What more could I do?""

And if we try and it don't work out
Like so many people do
It's just a fact of life, no we ain't in charge
There ain't nothin' that's wrong with me
Ain't nothin' that's wrong with you

Love's got nothin' to prove, it's not up to you
Two souls come into a world made
Of time and space, searchin' for the truth
With nothin' but love to prove
And find it in the gift of a moment of grace

You were a fool who just believed too much
But in the end, the fool
You'll come to know
Is not the one who loved

Is constant compromise

And I must have done somethin' so right
To be in love with you
And I ain't givin' up what I got

Kenny Loggins,"How do I know if I'm in love?
Who could I ever learn to trust?
I asked myself these questions for so long
What do I only wish to see?
What do I truly know to be?
I told myself to hold on tight
You never know enough
But now I see what I believe
'Cause I'm believin' love

[Chorus]
Whether my mind's sayin' it's crazy
Whether my world's sayin' I'm wrong
Wherever my heart goes, that's where I belong
I finally found out what faith is
I follow the way that it feels
And heaven has never been more real

When you looked into me
And you laid your hands on me
At once the deaf could hear
The blind could see
Now that I Know Love

I was a child alone, asleep
You came along and cradled me
You took me in your arms
And rocked me so sweetly
I'd prayed for love
To come to pass
How do we know if love will last?
And if it can't then someone tell me
What we're livin' for
I don't know what tomorrow holds
But I know what I know

[Chorus]

Glory be, I believe
Oh I finally see that love isn't blind
'Cause I've never seen more clearly in my life

And nobody fooled but me

Rainbow in the night,
Lightning on the sea,

Never before,

You know the rest of your life is mine,
How long can I be this sure,
Only for the rest of your life.

Self-assured before,
Had it figured out,
All I didn't know,
Is what it's all about,
You walked into my world,
Then it came alive
I never knew before,
Why I survived.

Oh, now I believe,
There's a god watching over me,
From up here, I can see the rest of my life,
You're giving me directions starting over,

You know the rest of your life is mine,

Whoa, I know it's over,
The past is over, ooh yeah

Kenny Loggins,"When will we know love?
When will we listen to heaven above?
And how will we return?
Someone said that we've been tempting fate
But I believe this song just wouldn't come if it's too late.

[Chorus]
When will we see a light upon the ocean.
Shining like a star
That leads us ever onward
There's a new world waiting
When will we see rebirth
This island Earth

Maybe our moment is gone
Maybe we've stood and watched
A moment too long
So why do I believe?
Someone said
That the truth's too much to take
But tell me how we can face it
If we only want to look the other way

[Chorus]

To a new beginning
Shine for all it's worth

Why, what will we say to the angry child,
Try to explain away her fears while we're crying burning tears

Whirling round each other for eons
Let's be god this time
Let's be human
Let's be light
Let's be all that is dark
Everything you are I see
And seeing is loving
And loving is remembering
Because this blueprint of your heart
I carry inside me
For all time
This soul memory of spirit
Wakes me from my dream
Rips the veils, pierces the certainty
Of my ever effusive despair
And I meet myself for the first time
We are, and all that I've learned about life
And love and men and women
Is false and phony and obscene
Love, take me, rip me into shreds
Baptize me again and again
In the warm wetness of my own tears
Burn down my walls, fast and furious
Like a drunken, divine glass blower
For all my fear is camouflage
My rage is the fuel of my truth telling
My demons are at home now
All my days and nights are for love}

Then we'll take the kids to Mama's
They can make snow angels in the yard
Like a Christmas card
We'll decorate the tree
Put an angel high above us
Like we always do
At Christmas

On and on it goes
Every year new memories to share
And for all we know
We will all of us be there

When the autumn leaves have gone to gold
And swallows know December's calling
I'll be flying home a thousand times
In all my sweetest dreams
I can see the glow in your eyes
As we sit by the fire
Like lovers we knew long ago
While we watch our angels in the snow

When December comes
We'll be trying to remember
Where we packed our woolen winter clothes
Only heaven knows
When December comes
We'll be hanging pine and holly
Singing all the songs we sing at Christmas

Home is ever near
Hearts return no matter what we do
And Love
Will build a bridge
And I will always be there with you

Kneeling by the window
Lookin' out across the driveway at the rain
Will it always rain

Comin' from the churchyard
And I thought they played their music just for me
And day by day
The rain turned to snow
I don't hear them anymore

Will ring for us again

What Christmas really means

So light a candle
That every man may see

Like the one we knew back when and

We'll ring the bells of Christmas

Lived around the corner
With eyes as black as Mary's must have been
I wonder

Does she miss her friend
I remember the day
All the bells were ringing
As I watched her cross the churchyard in the snow

And all my searching
for all I lack
Is just trying to get that feeling back

The bells of Christmas
Will ring for us again
When we truly do believe
What Christmas really means

So light a candle
That every man may see
A world of hope and promise
Like the one we knew back when and
We'll ring the bells of Christmas once again

Is in the children's hands
Perhaps if we could let them lead
We'd come to understand

Some children see him bronzed and brown,
With dark and heavy hair.

Some children see him almond-eyed,
With skin of yellow hue.

Some children see him dark as they,
Sweet mary's son to whom we pray,
Some children see him dark as they,
And, ah! they love him, too!

Will see the baby jesus' face

And you're tired and cold and wet
And you're looking for a place that's cozy and warm
You'll make it if you never forget

A kind and steady heart can conquer doubt and fear
A little courage goes a long long way
Gets you little bit further down the road each day
And before you know it you'll here someone say
That'll do, babe, that'll do

Gets you little bit further down the road each day

And your heart will lead you home

Funny how a photograph 
Can take you back in time
To places and races that you thought you'd left behind
Trying to remind you that you're not the only one
That no-one is an island when all is said and done

If you feel you lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waiting there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you home

There'll come a day when you're losing your way
And you won't know where you belong
They say that home is where the heart is
So follow your heart and know that you can't go wrong.

If you feel you lost
And on your own
And far from home
You're never alone you know
Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waiting there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you ...

You like making it rough on me don’t you? My, my, my
Back to the shack oh, oh yeah, nothing suits me better than that
If time has taught me anything, you've got to learn to be the ball
And I can’t keep from laughing at it all

I’m going now, I’m going all the way
Sooner or later going to love somebody
I don’t care how long it takes
Like a shot to the heart, I've got news for you
I may not look so smart, but I’m nobody’s fool, oh no

Oh no, that’s enough for me baby
Taking it slow, it’s too much for me to analyze
Still alright, heading into the rhythm of the southern night
Winds of wild insanity, blow with me tonight
Saddle up all you cowboys, going to ride

I’m going now, I’m going all the way
Sooner or later going to love somebody
Don’t care how long it takes
You can turn up the heat, but I’m playing it cool
Know it’s hard to believe, I am nobody’s fool

I’m going all the way
Sooner or later going to love somebody
Don’t care how long it takes
You might think that, I've not gone to school on you
Baby like it or not, I am nobody’s fool

You may try to deny it
In the place when the clown slaps you in the face
Leaves you dumbfounded there in his way, yeah

I’m going all the way
Sooner or later going to love somebody

Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you
And the love in his lullaby
Seem to tell me if I try, I could fly for you
Lover I wanna try for you 'cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern lights and skies ablaze I bring to you
If you let me sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I sing to you
Love is what I bring to you
I wanna sing to you, oh

I wanna sing you a love song

Kenny Loggins,"I'm thinking about when I was a sailor
Spent my time on the open seas
When we'd stay off the coast of Santa Barbara

I'd secretly steal ashore
The natives were waiting for
The boy with the lazy soul
To sing with the sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every evening I'd be gone
Back on board by break of dawn

I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica
Pretty girls dancin' here and there
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor

The captain he don't know
Where Billy he done go
Singing with native girls
The songs of a sailor

Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Vahevala, homeless sailor
Vahevala, homeward sail away
Every single, single way
Gotta be back on board by break of day

Every night in Jamaica
I'd sing with the lady
And drink with the men till the morning appear

Healthy sunshine
Is fresh on my face
As the songs of the night puts
The ring in my ear

Kenny Loggins,"Back in the days of the 33 and 45
First time I remember feelin' alive
Playin' like a'ringin' a bell 'n' I learned it off the radio
Sure it was only mama's broom but I was strummin' like a fool
A true believer till the day I die
If you'd a plugged me in, in front of all my friends
I would'a set the livin' room on fire

I was alive
Alive 'n' Kickin'
Like a time bomb tickin'
Headed for the Hullaballoo
There were no big gigs in sight
No bright white-hot spotlight
But everybody knew that I was Alive 'n' Kickin'

Got in a battle of the bands when I stole my big brother's guitar
Let me tell you, that'll never get you far
2000 Overnights later 'n' I'm still not on the radio

Got a new Best Friend
He was more than Sittin' In
'N' we were makin' our mark on the road
Our regalia'd hit Full Sail
'N' we were trapped into the Mother Lode

We was alive
Alive 'n' Kickin'
Like a time-bomb tickin'
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone
As far as we could see
It was the way it was meant to be
The whole world knew that we was
Alive 'n' Kickin'

It's been miles 'n' miles
Still Alive
And pickin'

Now I'm in the daze of the downloadin' digital fights
Bit by bit, byte by byte
But everybody says it's music 'cause they hear it on the radio

'N' when I hit the stage I'm gonna rattle your cage
I still remember how to howl at the moon
And I can carry the load whether I'm on the road
Or jus' appearing in my living room

'Cause I am alive
Alive 'n' Kickin'
Like a time-bomb tickin'
This boy's ready to blow

Don't need to tell you why
I'm gonna love to do it 'til the day I die
Everybody's gonna know that I
Am Alive 'n' Kickin'

We been rockin' since '73
And just between you 'n' me
You better believe that we
Are alive
Alive 'n' Kickin'

Kenny Loggins,"Look at us and the life that we made
Oh darlin', I wouldn't trade a single thing
Still in love
But I can't help dream about yesterday, oh yesterday

I miss Sunday mornings free and easy
Lazy days and endless evenings
I really thought somehow
That I'd be over it by now

And I miss lying in your arms till morning
With nothing on our minds but making love
Baby most of all
I miss us

Like a child, I know it is selfish to say
But sometimes I want you all to myself
For a while
Couldn't we go back and play in yesterday, oh yesterday

Walking on the beach alone together
Sunsets that would last forever
No where else to be
Side by side just you and me

And I miss lying in your arms 'til morning
With nothing on our minds but making love
Baby most of all
I miss us

All that we have lost
Has all come back as love
I know that's what family is about
Still I miss

Sunday mornings free and easy
Lazy days and endless evenings
I know we'll survive
But it is eating me alive

And I miss lying in your arms 'till morning
With nothing on our minds but making love
I can't hold it back another minute
I'm embarrassed to admit it

But I still want to be your everything

Is way more than enough

I wake up again at 4:00
I read a while
Then try to sleep some more
But by 6:00 AM I'm gone again
Lost in the logic of despair
Cause you just can't reason with someone
Who ain't even there
I been right about the reasons
This bein' right is getting nowhere
And it's time for movin' on

I'm letting go of the anger
I been holding in my heart
I'm letting go of the bitterness

I couldn't give before
I don't want to hate you anymore

I loved you for your honesty
Now I hate you for your lies
Still I just don't see the wisdom in goodbye
So I'll put my fears in a letter of tears
I guess I never intended to send
The future's hard to believe in if I can't even see the end
There are no easy answers
It's just a fact of life
You know somebody's always leavin'
Somebody's always left behind

""Jesus"", she hears a young boy pray 
""Could You bring back my daddy? ,
I know that You'll find a way.

And the next time You see daddy, 
Tell him I'm alright and 
There's a fire in my heart for him, 
That's always burning bright
Tell him that I pray for him, 
Each and every day.""

Bedtime, where she taught him to pray
""Now I lay me down to sleep""
Where the words he would say.
""Jesus"" she hears him again
And she faces the faith of a child
That's no longer pretend

And the next time You see daddy, 
Tell him I'm alright and 
There's a fire in my heart for him, 
That's always burning bright
Tell him that I pray for him, 
Each and every day.""

Bedtime, in her room all alone
She feels the Presence of 
Someone unseen, someone unknown
""Jesus"" she hears herself start
Let the fire of forgiveness 
Burn bright in this broken down heart

And the next time You see Johnny, 
Tell him it's alright and 
There's a fire of forgiveness, 
That's always burning bright
There's Someone he can pray to 
Each and every night.""",Next Time You See Johnny
"Kenny Martin, Jr.","It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

And life was nothing but an awful song

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?

I'm so lonely so lonely at midnight for you
Midnight oh what a lonely time to weep I ought to know
Midnight I should have been fast asleep hours ago
Still I'm crying I'm crying cause I miss you so

Kenny Price,"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup o'er hills and meadows we'd roamed
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun we grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there to the rescue he came he jumped in and helped pull me out
The years rolled along and at last he grew old his eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said I can't do no more for him Jim
With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it I wanted to run and I wished they'd shot me instead
I went to his side and I sat on the ground he laid his head on my knees
I stroke the best pal that a man ever found I cried so I scaresly could see
Old Shepy he knew he was going to go for he reached out and nipped at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say we're parting but you'll understand
Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep
Kenny Price,"Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus.
Steal away, steal away home.
I ain't got long to stay here.
I was walkin' in Savannah past a church decayed and dim
And there slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn.
A sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
Till I found myself environed in a little Negro pew.
Down front sat a young couple nearly wild.
On the altar was a coffin, in the coffin was a child.
Rose a sad old Negro preacher at a little wooden desk
With a manner grandly awkward and a countenance grotesque.
And he said ""Now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay,
For the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away
And he's doin' very finely and he appreciates your love
But his sure nuff Father want him in the large house above
Now He didn't give you that baby for a hundred thousand miles.
He just think you need some sunshine and He lent him for awhile
And He let you love and keep him 'till your hearts were bigger grown
And those silver tears you're sheddin' are just interest on the loan.
So my poor dejected mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go criticizin' the one that knows the best.
He gave us many comforts, He has the right to take away.
To the Lord be praise and glory, now and ever let us pray.
My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder. The trumpet sounds
Within my soul.
I ain't got long to stay here. I'm gonna steal away home.",Steal Away

Kenny Price,"Listen while I tell you bout a place I know down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
The moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there all right but they all go native on Saturday night

Well the music is a fiddle and a crack guitar they give the kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods're full of couples lookin' for romance
They struggle and they shuffle till the broad daylight
And they all go native on Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fella packs a gun
Everybody does his best to act just right
Cause it's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight

If you don't stop drivin' that hot rod Lincoln

Now you've heard the story of the hot-rod race
When the Ford and Lincoln was settin' the pace
That story's true I'm here to say
'Cause I was drivin' that Model-A

Got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model-A body makes it look like a pup
Got eight cylinders'n uses them all
Got overdrive, just won't stall

Got a four-barrel carb and dual exhaust
4-11 gears it can really get lost
Got safety tubes but I'm not scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Was out on San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright
We were drivin' up on Grapevine hill
Passin' cars like they was standin' still

Now all of a sudden in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said boys that's a mark for me
By then, the taillights was all you could see

Well the fellers ribbed me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well I wound her up to a hundred and ten
My speedometer said I'd hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road just looked like dots

Went around a corner and passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Well smoke was comin' outta the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, thought I could pass
Don't ya know by then we'd be low on gas

Went around a corner, side-swiped the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said hold on boys, I got a license to fly
And the Caddy pulled over and let me by

Now all of a sudden the rods started knockin'
And down in the dip she started a'rockin'
I looked in the mirror, red lights was blinkin'

Did you ever love a woman who broke your heart every day of her life

And crawl out on your knees with your head a reelin'

And no matter what I do nothing turns out right
I guess a blind man could see how losing you got the best of me

I guess they don't feel at home cause there's no home here anymore
But I bet all our friends can see how losing you got the best of me
I'm not the same man you knew for there's very little me without you
And though I tried how I tried to go on I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not that strong
When I held you I held life in my hand and losin' life would do the same for any man
I was a slave who never asked to be free

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love

Why does the rain fall from up above

It will reach defeat

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you

You came out in front and I was hiding

A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem

With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming

When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

There is nothing for me but to love you, just the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart
And that laugh, that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart
Lovely, never, never change keep that breathless charm

And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they
Did before

That ol' storm broke out
And girl ran off and left me in the rain
Though she's gone I doubt
If she'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if she
Should

Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til the sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane

Kenny Rankin,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

",Where Do You Start
Kenny Ray Horton,"Once in a lifetime, love comes along
And I know it's you that I'm waiting on
And that sweet promise of our first kiss
Keeps me hanging on, through times like this

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart
Keep wishing upon that same ol' star
And know that I love you, wherever you are

Can't say I know what you look like 
But you're in my heart, you're on my mind
And I feel your love deep down in my soul
When I finally find you, I'll just know

So wherever you are, I'm thinking of you
I wonder if you're thinking of me, too
There's only so long, time can keep up apart
So until we meet, keep me in your heart

Would invite us to begin the day

We would ever need 
Love was strong for so long 
Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right 
We tried to find what we had 
Till sadness was all we shared 
We were scared 
This affair would lead our love into

Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through, God her love is true.

I was sitting here thinking about some old times
Some old times, some old friends
Suddenly it came across my mind
That I would like to see you again.

Remember how we used to walk and talk
Walk and talk holding hands
We said we loved each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans.

But the years have come and gone
And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight your memory's awful strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again.

It's funny how an old flame comes down
Come on back, make you blue
But I saw the picture of a railroad track
An old shot of me and you.

I guess I'd better straighten up my mind
Straighten it up and go to bed
I pray that I don't dream about old times
Some old times, gone and dead

But years have come and goneâ?¦.

Wondering what laid beyond as far as you could see
You left to find a castle, a knight in shining armor
Or maybe just to spread your wings and feel that you are free.

Runaway girl, there's someone here who loves you
And understands you, you're not alone
Runaway girl, I won't stop until I found you
And put my arms around you and take you home.

You longed to fame and fortune, you were looking for a rainbow
Knowing someone down the line has found your heart of gold
Castles sometimes crumble and too often dreams were shattered
Then you'll be left with nothing but a tortured mind and soul

Kenny Rogers,"As a child, mama told me all about You
And all the things You've done
I wondered all these years how You kept goin'
And had the strength to carry on
She said You'd always be beside me
To help me up if I should fall
If I get lost You'll always find me
And all I have to do is call

When Moses cried for help to free his people
You opened up the mighty sea
When David said, â??He sure looks big, Lord!â??, You said,
Â??Here's a stone and you've got Me!â??
And when Daniel said, â??The lions are gonna get me Lord!â?? You said,
Â??Get down, get down on your knees.â??
And in six short days You made the world we live in,
And still You find the time for me.

Oh, You stayed up forty days and forty nights
Makin' all that rain
And when You see us messin' up this world You love so much
That's gotta bring pain
If I was big enough, and strong enough to help you, Lord, I would
But I can't
You gotta be tired, Lord
You gotta be tired

Kenny Rogers,"I don't understand your hesitation.
You always were so quick to say 
What needed to be said.
But you're standing there, 
Just saying nothing.
Please say something, 
Just don't tell me I'm too late.

It took a while for me 
To understand my feelings for you.
I hope it's not too late, 
To say I love you, 
'Cause god knows I do.

Before you turn away 
And the chance I had to love you is gone,
You got to know
I've finally found the feeling

And though I never told you,
I live my life to hold you

Am I too late
To show myself
Is it too late to let you know

Do you feel me
Am I touching you
Scares me to think you might say no
Cause it's too late for me to let you go

You got to know
I've finally found the feeling
And though I never told you
I live my live to hold you

Am I too late to show myself
Is it too late to let you know

Am I touching you
It scares me to think you might say no
Cause it's too late
For me
To let you go

Am I too late

Kenny Rogers,"WE DON'T WE MAKE LOVE ANYMORE
WRITERS KENNY ROGERS, MARIANNE GORDON

The love that we have
Is not so bad
Unless you think about
The love that we had
I don't know, who closed the door
But we don't make love anymore

We used to love
You used to care
Now it's hard to find
The feeling we shared
You found a way
To even the score
And we don't make love anymore

So come lie down
Beside me and talk to me
Touch me with your body and your mind
Help me find the feeling
And push all this behind
We'll make sweet, sweet love one more time

But you won't try
And I'll understand
We'll just live our lives
The best we can
We turn out the lights
We still lock the door
But we don't make love anymore

Pretending again
I think we both know this is the end
We can try it again
But we better face it
Losing again
I know we both thought this time we'd win
But you can't take thing and just erase it.

Could it be we talked too long
Maybe we should start off being friends
And try it again.
Could it be we both were wrong
Maybe we should sing our song again
And rewrite the end, start it again.

Start it again
Not looking for love, needing a friend
And knowing inside it's gonna be better
Laughing again
And thinking how wrong we were back then
We're happy again and this is forever.

Now we know we both were wrong
Aren't you g lad we sang our song again
To rewrite the end and start it again.
We start love, love, love
Start it again.



",Starting Again
Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us,
And he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind me sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his faced lost all expression
He said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die
in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

You've got to know when to hold 'em (when to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (when to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away
And know when to run

Kenny Rogers,"Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again
At least I had you every now and then
And in between the sorrow
At least there was tomorrow
And as long as there's tomorrow
There's no end
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.

Oh, I wish that we could play that game again
Even though I'd always lose and you would win
At times you would desert me
The emptiness would hurt me
But your coming back
Was always worth the pain
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.

I?d love to hear you tell me
You don't need me anymore
Just like you used to tell me everyday
I'd love to watch you leaving
Like the hundred times before
At least my eyes could see you walk away.

Kenny Rogers,"Like a leaf caught in the wind
He drifted a while
With no purpose or direction to his life
He tried to get himself together
And pacify his mind
And forget about the things he left behind

The cryin' woman
Standing helpless in his door
With a two month old baby-why in her arms
His little black book 
Laying torn up on the floor
And God only knows he never meant to do her wrong

A careless weekend on the other side of town
Has torn the King of Oak Street's Castle down
And all week long he's tried to ca-all her
But she won't let him explain
Now Sunday morning finds him walking i-in the rain

He sits down in a phone booth and he prays
That she'll forgive him 
And she'll believe he's changed his ways
With shaking hand 
He deposits hi-is last dime
And he's still praying that she won't hang you-up this time

Then the sweetest voice he's ever heard says hello
Breakfast's a-almost ready baby-why, come on home
I've thought the whole thing over 
And I think I understand
That the King of Oak Street is just an ordinary man

Kenny Rogers,"His daddy was an honest man, red dirt Georgia farmer
His mama lived her short life having kids and baling hay
He had fifteen years, an ache inside to wander
He hopped a freight in Waycross, wound up in L.A.

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitutions child born of an L.A. street called shame

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings, brought a meaning to his life
Yes, the night before she left, sleep came and left that Waycross
Country boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light of her door
When a right cross sent him reeling, put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
He growled that Georgia neck is red, but sonny your still green

He turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross Georgia boy
Starin' at those four gray, in silence he would listen
That midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lyin' 'neath the red light of her door
With a bullet in his side he cried have you seen Mabel Joy
Stunned and shaken someone said she's not here no more
She left this house four years today

Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says ""how was your night?""
And I come to her and say, ""it was all right,"" and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday, if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows, maybe, on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong

Kenny Rogers,"Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door, and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now, it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""hey look, old yeller's leaving""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door

Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothin' back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""this one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall

(And I heard him say) ""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man""

Everyone considered him the coward of the county",Coward of the County
Kenny Rogers,"If my heart's not too late
For a piece of your time
There's been so many days
Since your eyes looked at mine

In the dark of this room
Where the burning has grown
You believe in your love
When you're lost and alone

And life don't give no reasons
When the love goes away
No answers for someone like you

Hold me, hold me
Seems like we never get together anymore
Hold me, hold me
Starry nights don't come enough
That's what we come here for, hold me

I will lay by your side
I can warm your cold nights
You can play in my dreams
'Till I'm out of your sight in the morning, my love

Couldn't change where you go
You were always my woman
It's the one truth I know
So hold out when there's no chance
For your love anyway
No diamond could shine close to you

Hold me, hold me
Seems like we never get together anymore
Hold me, hold me

That's what we came here for, hold me",In and Out of Your Heart
Kenny Rogers,"She's got dinner on the table at seven
The kids are tucked in bed by nine-fifteen
And she's headed for a hotel at eleven
To meet a man her family's never seen.

As the elevator takes her to her lover
She thinks about his wife at home asleep
And she knows it must be painful to discover
That the man you love's not always yours to keep.

Well, she's one man's bride
And she's one man's on the side
She wonders why it takes two men
To keep her satisfied.

She's a hard workin' house-wife
Right now she's occupied
She's one man's woman
And one man's on the side
Yes, she's one man's woman
And one man's on the side.

She thinks about her husband when it's over
But she justifies her love affair somehow
She knows it can't go on like this forever
But she takes it all from day to day for now.

Once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes

Kenny Rogers,"In Cumberland Kentucky
On a cool autumn evening
Billy lay in love with Marianne
She was a rich judge's daughter
He was the son of a miner
But that night their love was more than they could stand
The judge said to his daughter
“That son of that coal miner
Is someone you'd do well to leave alone”
She knew her dad so well
She knew she couldn't tell
But the truth was bound to show before too long
Their love had started growing on its own

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law

Billy placed his hand on Mary
And he felt the baby moving
Kissed her, and said ""I'll see you when I can""
The judge had made a promise
When he caught up with Billy
He'd send him far away from Marianne
The whole town knew he'd do it
Too many times he'd proved it
To at least a hundred men behind the wall
He'd smile behind that frown
And when he brought that gavel down
He called himself the long arm of the law
And he'd set his mind on seeing Billy fall

In a hot and humid mine shack
The midwife pulled the sheet back
And placed a cool, damp towel on Marianne
Billy's eyes were wide with wonder
From the spell he was under
When she placed the newborn baby in his hands
He didn't hear the siren
Just the baby crying
That miracle of love was all he saw
When the door came crashing down
And Billy turned around
He felt the heart and soul inside him fall
He stood face-to-face with the long arm of the law

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law
You can hide out for a while
He says with a smile
But you can't outrun the long arm of the law

Seemed like everybody down in Cumberland, Kentucky
Came out that day to see poor Billy's trial
The court was called to order
There sat the judge's daughter
She looked so proud, holding Billy's child
When they brought Billy to him
The judge just looked right through him
As he held that Holy Bible in his hand
Then he smiled at his grandson
And his eyes cut back to Billy
He said ""I think this time the law will understand
Son, I sentence you to life with Marianne""

You can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law
He said to Billy with a smile
I know you hid out for a while
But you can't outrun the long arm of the law
No, you can't outrun the long arm of the law",Long Arm of the Law

All the folks around Madison County cussed your name
You`re just a no-account, sharecropping colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

The gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
You were the one that didn`t turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

With your mind on my soul and a Bible in your right hand
You said ""turn the other cheek
A-there`s a better world a-waiting for the meek""
In my mind these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed field of my mind
The faded shirt, the weathered brow
The calloused hands upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

One dark, cloudy day they brought you from the field
Until your lonely pinebox came
Just a preacher and me in the rain
Just to sing one last refrain for Reuben James

The calloused hands upon the plow

To see the signs of things to come

Well, you've taken my life in the palm of your hand â??
Make you mine for another day;
There ain't nobody that doesn't need anybody
When the good times turn away.

I don't want to be the lonely one,
Fade away in the evening sun;
I could love you all of my life;
You are my wife; haven't I told you so?

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.

We don't need it, we don't need it

We don't need no buried treasure,
No buried treasure; we don't need it.
We don't stand on ceremony,
But life is phony in spite of it.

You can never be all you want to be
When you're searching for gold;
We don't need no buried treasure;
I've still got you, still got you, still got you;
I've still got you in my soul.",Buried Treasure

On a stranger with no dream

I can never play somebody else's game, I can follow the evening star

If you follow the evening star

Have you ever known a sunset when the sky's on fire
How you end another day boy you've been searching too far
Like the desert I rode on any memory is lost in the restless wind
I just lie beneath the evening star

Shine a little Heaven
On a stranger with no dream

Put your money on a good night if you never been there

Kenny Rogers,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha

That I've never learned

Since you gave your love to me.

When I met you on a Monday
My life just stood still
I belong in every moment
That your love can fill
Let me be the only heart you can mend
Turn out the light and take it right to the end

In the madness of my mind
In a world I could not find
But you knew what to do

In return for the midsummer nights.

There's been so many tears

And the winter came
And you said goodbye
And I don't want another reason to cry

To make those long legs mine, is all I care about
She's got so much to give, I got to be the one
I got to have
Someone to hold 
I got to make it with that woman 
When the nights get hot
And she goes walking by
And the city lights, and the city lights
They make you blind
I go insane
But am I crazy if she feels the same
You believe what you believe
You got the darkest night

Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me

Throught the window I can see

I hear a church bell ring

After all this time

Easy to turn and walk away when love goes wrong
Harder to stay and work it out but if the love is strong
We must choose to hold on to something
We don't wanna lose

After all this time
Did you think I let you slip away from me?
Girl, we've come too far
Just to turn our love into a memory

Did you think that I can push you aside?
All that we've been through
Me and you, never give a try
After all this time
",After All This Time
Kenny Rogers,"JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE 
IF I COULD FIND SOMEONE, IF ONCE 
THE FEELING WAS RIGHT 
I'D NEVER LET HER GO
I'D ALWAYS BE THERE
IF I COULD HAVE MY CHANCE TO BE
THE ONLY ONE
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR

CHORUS

IF I COULD HOLD ON TO LOVE 
I'D NEVER LET IT GO
I'D KEEP IT RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART

IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE

I'M SEARCHING MY DREAMS
I'M TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACE,
OH,
WHO CAN IT BE?

I'M

RUNNING TO HER
BUT EVERYTIME I GET THIS CLOSE
SHE VANISHES
INTO THE NIGHT

Kenny Rogers,"You wanna know if I care for you
You ought to know by now
How can you stand there just pretending
And you know how I feel.

Â'cause baby youÂ're my love
And I love everything you do to me
YouÂ're my love
And I love when youÂ're around
YouÂ're my love
And IÂ've never let you down.

You wanna know what I see you
I can really say it for sure
All I know is I need you
More than IÂ've ever needed
Anyone else before.

Â'cause baby youÂ're my love ....

seasons changing faster than they do
And we be gone
ItÂ's funny but we didnÂ't seem to care
The only thing we cared about
Was keeping you out, our strong
As long as youÂ're there
IÂ'll always care.

Kenny Rogers,"Desperado, why don't you come to your senses,
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now,
Oh and you're a hard one, but I know that you've got your reasons,
The things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow.

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, she'll beat you if she's able.
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table,
But you only want the ones you can't get.

Desperado, you ain't gettin' no younger,
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home,
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'.
Your prison is walking through this world all alone.

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime,
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine,
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day.
And you're losin' all your highs and lows,
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses,
Come down from your fences- open the gates.
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you.
You'd better let somebody love you,
Let somebody love you. 
You'd better let somebody love you,
Before it's too late.",Desperado
Kenny Rogers,"I don't need you.
I don't need friendship.

I don't peace and harmony.
I don't need you.
And you surely don't need me.

But we both want it bad enough.
Yes, we both want it.  Don't we?
I don't need you baby.
And I know you don't need me.

I don't need your loving arms around me.
All I need is to be free.
That's what I keep telling myself.
And I tell you, you don't need me.

I don't need children in my old age.
No more cluttered leaves around the tree.
And I don't need you baby.

You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways I want to say ""I love you""
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song?

Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever, let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

Kenny Rogers,"Girl, we've come a long, long way
Too far for us to end this way
Sometimes the cost of love is hard
And we must pay this little give-and-take

So don't you think if you and I
Were just about and let our hearts decide
Maybe it would all work out in time
So won't you stay, please don't go away.

Love, love is what we make it
We can make it so much better if we try
Love, love is what we make it
So let?s make it real good this time.

Is it too late to change your mind?
Or has it gone to fall this time
Won't you hold me just one more time

Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more.

Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.

Whoa, I can take her or leave her
But I like to take her away

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain

And some want to just sit and talk

Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a barstool, she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her she said ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""
In the mirror, I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking, his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the barroom
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal

Kenny Rogers,"Sing a song sweet music man 'cause I won't be there
To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
""I need you"", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new

Oh, but nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along
Nobody else can make me feel things are right
When I know they're wrong, nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, travel the world
With a six piece band that does for you what you tell 'em to
And you try to stay young but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun came back on you

Sing your song sad music man, makin' your living
Doing one night stands, they're through with you
They don't need you, you're still a heck of a singer but a broken man
But you'll keep on lookin' for one last fan to sing to

Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along and nobody else
Can make me feel things are right when they're wrong with a song
Nobody sings a love song quite like you

Sing your song sweet music man, I believe in you

Kenny Rogers,"It was six in the morning
When I made the county line
There's someone I got to talk to
I can't get it off my mind

He's just a kid
And he's in a pretty rough spot
Two dimes to make a phone call
That's about all I've got

How's my boy today?
I know it's been three weeks
But you know how far I've got to go
To make those loose ends meet

How's your mama now
With her new live-in friend
Oh how I hate the wounds 
That never seem to mend

[Chorus:]
And he says I don't call him daddy
but he takes care of things
When you pick me up on Friday
Are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh don't worry dad ya know 
It don't matter what we do 
I don't call him daddy 
He could never be like you
Never be like you

God bless their little hearts
They're the ones who really pay
When mom and dad can't get along
And go their seperate ways
In a way I'm glad there's someone
There to fill the empty place
Tears of understanding
Streak down a dirty face

[Chorus]

He is quite a little man 
Growing up as fast as he can
And I don't get to see him
Half as much as I had planned 
There's so much I need to tell him
So precious little time
A little rain on the window
In a little way goodbye

Kenny Rogers,"When tempting eyes across the road
 Said to me I'd love to be with you
 I'm not tempted for a moment
 I just think about my woman
 The baby calls me on the phone
 Telling me I need to hurrily home
 Well the hurrying is easy
 Because she's waiting up
 With all the love I need

 I prefer the moonlight
 The one right little lady by my side
 That's what I like
 I prefer a late drive down the turn park
 With the moonlight shining so brightly
 Got her by my side
 That's what I'd like
 I prefer the moonlight

 I prefer playing quiet song
 She's a mother love her daughter
 Moonlight dances on the water
 The moon is full and so am I
 I look at her and feel like I could cry
 But my tears contain no sorrow
 Because I know
 She'll wake up by my side tomorrow

 When the feeling comes so right
 Somewhere in some sky
 Where the moon is surely shining bright

You'll give me one more day.

I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you

I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted whom, I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so

Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Till boredom overtook us, and he began to speak

He said, ""son, I've made my life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression
Said, ""if you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done

Now ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep""

So when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run",Loser
Kenny Rogers,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

The price was too high for returning

I have spent all my love
Getting none in return

As it rings in my brain
Telling me she's in love

the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights, even stoplights, blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Where ox and ass are feeding?

The silent Word is pleading. 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,

Hail, hail, the Word made flesh,

Come, peasant, king, to own him.

Of the fact that you weren't around

And she made a promise, never to utter a sound

Something's Burning I think it's love
I believe it's love

And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever
I cup my hands to touch your face
Once again I feel your fire

Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it 
Here comes
Feel it

Kenny Rogers,"Sunshine, you may find my window
But you won't find me
And sunshine, I've got my friend of darkness here
Tonight to hide me.

So sunshine, as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
And sunshine, as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me.

Cause she doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want me, Lord
She doesn't need me anymore
She grew tired of chasing rainbows
But I loved her true
And God you know I tried.

And I guess she was right
Cause I'm at the end
I found the part but there's no golden sun.

So sunshine, can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
And sunshine, pick up your dawn
And move on down the street.",Sunshine

Tell it all brothers and sisters

When you say you're giving all? 
And in the dungeons of your mind 
Who you got chained to the wall? 
Tell it all brother, before we fall 
Tell it all brothers and sisters 
Tell it ah-ah-aal 
Did you plant your feet on higher ground 
To avoid life's mud and stone? 
Did you ever kick a good man 
When he was down, just to make yourself feel strong? 
Tell it all brother, before we fall 
Tell it all brothers and sisters 
Tell it ah-ah-aal 
Tomorrow just might be too late 
Now is the time 
To get your jumbled mind straight 
And seek a new design 
Did you ever walk for a crippled man 
Pretending you were lame? 
And what made you think one feeble hand to God 
Was gonna make him call your name?

Tell it all brother, before we fall 
Tell it all brothers and sisters, tell

Kenny Rogers,"When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I've waken up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road, once again it seems
All I've left behind, is a chain of broken dream

But you know I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

How I wish that love, is all we need to live
What a life we'd live, 'cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong, deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign could be keeping us apart
When you know I love
Yes I love you

And if I could only find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life of mine didn't cross our minds
All the answers were found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Just to pay the rent, I must leave you all alone
But you know I made me choice many years ago
And this traveling life is the only one I know

But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you
But you know, I love you
Yes I love you, oh I love you

But you know, I love you

Kenny Rogers,"Ain't funny how time
Steals the feeling from a love affair
And there's no place to lay the blame
'cos in any case, oh, no one cares
Helplessly we just watched it fade away
Neither will admit it
Are we both aching to say.

We, you, I miss the days when we were crazy in love
When you were so sure of me, I had my little jealousy.
We, you, bring back the days when we were crazy in love
I wanna feel that way again, remember when we were crazy in love.

I know it used to be so easy
One touch and I was high
And I could get intoxicated
Just by looking in your eyes
Oh, baby ain't there anything we can do
Cos I know you're missing me
As much as I've been missing you.

We, you, 

Girl, we were more than best of friends
We were crazy in love.",Crazy in Love
Kenny Rogers,"If I were a painting
Captured on canvas
Alone in the portriat I would stand
And brush strokes bold
Yet soft as a whisper
The work of a feminine hand

Caught in a still life
Surrounded by shadows
And lost in a background of blue

If I were a painting
My price would be pain
And the artist would have to be you

I imagine the colors
Would all run together
If you ever allowed me to cry
So don't paint the tears
Just let me remember me
Without you in my LIFE

It's only the frame
That holds me together
Or else I would be falling apart

If I were a painting
I wouldn't feel
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart",If I Were a Painting
Kenny Rogers,"Woman you're the closest thing
I know, to peace on earth
You warm to what feels cold in me
And healing to what hurts.

Woman can you tell me why
I'm driven as I am
Is there something that I have
That makes you give a damn.

Be my comfort when the world
Waves me to the ground
Take me when I've lost my way
Let me know I'm found.

Be a blanket to my soul
Wrap it all around
Be a feather babe to me
And lay my body down.

Touch me with your finger tips
Give my burdens rest
Tell me not to worry so
I know that you know best.

And hold them in your arm
Lie against me in the dark
And show me I've come home.

Kenny Rogers,"Early dawn, another lazy, stormy Monday morn,
Outside my ride is layin' on the horn,
But I won't be torn, from your arms

Work can wait,
I call the boss and tell him I'll be late,
I've been saving for this rainy day,
What do you say we stay at home,
And make love all day long,

[Chorus]

And let's just listen to the rain fall,
Music on the window pane, that's all;
Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Just crawl back in bed,
Pull the covers overhead,
Me and you,
Like John and Yoko use to do,
Let's just listen to the rain

Life moves fast,
Let's find a way to make the moments last,
Forget the future, and forget the past,
Girl all I ask of you

Let's just listen to the rain fall, 
Music on the window pane, that?s all,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained;
Just crawl back in bed; pull the covers overhead
Me and you,
Like John and Yoko use to do

Let it pour, we'll hold each other let the thunder roar,
Love is never felt like this before,
And I need more of you

So let's just listen to the rain fall, 
Music on the window pane, that?s all,
Nothing ventured, nothing gained;
We'll crawl back in bed; pull the covers overhead
Me and you,
Like John and Yoko use to do

Just listen to the rain",Listen to the Rain
Kenny Rogers,"Love is strange
Lots of people take it for a game
Once you get it you never want to quit
After you've had it
You say love, love is strange
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses are a miss

Hey, you sexy thing
How do call your love girl?
I say love girl
And if she doesn't answer
I say you'd better come here love girl
And if she still doesn't answer
Well then it is
Baby love is strange, baby, baby ...
You are the one

Tell me something
How do you call your love boy?
I say come here love boy
Oh, but if he doesn't answer
I say, ah come here love boy
But what if he still doesn't answer
I simply say, baby, oh my baby
Come here like that
You're the one

How do you call your lover boy

Kenny Rogers,"I am only one of those who care
Who care about the faith of love
I know there's many others just like me
I know they two ain't had enough
Cos this heart's doin' battle on the front line
Love's got no heroes in these modern times
What love needs is a defender
I am a soldier of love.

I see it in your eyes you felt the heat
There was a time when you believed
Love is the only way to make it thro'

Kenny Rogers,"Everybody's heart is torn and tattered
Mine was not designed for giving up
'Cause all I've ever done that really matters
It's what I did for love.

So count me with the wound and the shaking
Even when I'm barely standing up
I've tried to offer more than I have taken
It's what I did for love.

What I did for love, what I did for love
And I hope that you can see
All that love they've done for me

And when they sit and list the reasons I've existed
I'm afraid it won't add up to very much
'Cause I've gathered all I had and gladly rested
That's what I did for love.

What I did for love,?

Some day I'll make silently surrender

But I hope that I will always be remembered
For what I did for love.",What I Did for Love

I thought I'd never find
With the strength to be gentle
And the courage to be kind

Though it hasn't all been roses
Still I know you understand
One of these nights
When we're sharing a dream

I'm gonna take you by the hand
And lay you down on a bed of roses
In that peaceful shelter
Only love can provide
I'll lay you down on a bed of roses
And then I'll lay me down, right by your side

There's no diamond on your finger
Just a simple wedding band
Since your knight in shining armor
Is just an ordinary man

Though I promised you a kingdom
And we don't have all we planned
One of these nights
When we're making believe

I'm gonna take you by the hand
And lay you down on a bed of roses
In that peaceful shelter
Only love can provide

And then I'll lay me down, right by your side
And then I'll lay me down, right by your side",Bed of Roses
Kenny Rogers,"There's your picture by the bed
I'm gonna leave it where it is
'cause if I tear it out tonight
My heart would know
But something ain't right
Between me and you.
I'm gonna lie here in the dark
And pretend you're in my arms
And if I can't keep on crying out your name
My heart would think you're here beside me
And things are still the same.
My mind knows it's over
But how do I break it to my heart
If I let it down easy
It'd still be torn apart
And if I tell it the truth
Then the pain is gonna start
My mind knows it's over
But how do I break it to my heart.
When I saw him by your side
I guess it opened up my eyes
And my ears can finally hear your soft goodbye
But my heart still says I'm loving you tonight
And for the rest of its life.",How Do I Break It to My Heart

I'll be there for you
When your dreams seem far away
Even in the darkest night
You can face the world unafraid

And if you close your eyes
You will feel me next to you
No matter what you're going through
I'll be there for you

Here today, here tomorrow
Through the joy, laughter and sorrow
You're in my heart, we're kindred souls

Kenny Rogers,"He was sitting on a bar stool
A picture from a cheating song
She'd been standing by the jukebox
Dropping quarters all night long.

He said, tell me: are you lonely?
Is there some place we can go?
She said: cowboy, you know I'm lonely
But there's something you should know:

If you wanna find gold
Go looking in the mountains
If you wanna find silver
Go digging in stones
If you wanna find heaven
Go reading in the Bible
If you wanna find love
Go looking at home.

She touched the gold ring on his finger
And held it to the jukebox light
And she said. Stranger, think what you're losing
If you leave here with me tonight.

So he hold her body closer
She felt feelings she'd never known
And he said: thank you, for the lesson
And if you need me I'll be at home.

Your memory won't let me go at all
I found no way out since you've been gone
Some prisons don't have walls.

Someone is wishing they've done you right
Regretting they hurt you so.

Now that you're here in my loving arms
Forget all your yesterdays

For letting you slip away.

When I see the moon shining in your eyes

I must replace, racing through the people chase
But still surrounded by memories of your face

They just don't make 'em like you anymore
Not up in the mountains or down by the shore
Something shine in the fashion in the smile that you wore
They just don't make 'em like you anymore

In the eyes of someone new I wait for a glimpse of you
But it's never there, one among the precious few
Your kind of person is becoming so rare

They just don't make 'em like you anymore
Like those white lace dresses at the second hand store
Or sweet old songs filtering out through the floor
They just don't make 'em like you anymore

Fashion comes and the fashion goes
And the gossip magazines and the videos
A brand new actress on a screen
In a brand new style of clothes
But by any other name a rose is still a rose

And it grows in my memories
Wonder if you still are the same while I look for a remedy
Someone with a tender heart to clean your name

They just don't make 'em like you anymore
It's an easy thing to learn but so hard to ignore

It was a little rundown, the grass was overgrown
Its screen door was opening with the wind

'cause everything is changing way too fast
I can't help it long for how it used to be

And lock the world outside

Why don't we just lay down what we're doin'
We don't need a reason or a rhyme
Don't take the time to stop and think about it 
If we talk too much we might just change our mind 

So why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love
And stay a long long time

Why don't we go somewhere and love
And leave it all behind
Why don't we just go somewhere and love

No one knows the thigs that make you cry.
Looking back it seems

We can make this love go on forever
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you can't you see
And although you may think I'm crazy
Here is where I'll always be
And I need you with me 'cause you are the dream
That finally came true for me
And all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life there could be no one else
And for the rest of my life all I need is you",Crazy
Kenny Rogers,"Here it is seven in the a.m.
It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me
I wake up with this need again
But feel the love of the woman beside me

It's just one of those days
When I wanna lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

It looks like I'm gonna be late again
And I gonna give up and get movin' and I'm tryin'
But the longer I keep stalling
The more I think about callin' in and lying

It's just one of those days
When I wanna stay here with her
And watch her while she sleeps
And listen to the rain fall on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire

Well, I love to hear the rain fallin' on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

Oh, I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire
With morning desire, with morning desire

Listen to the rain
Listen to the rain
Listen to the rain

",Morning Desire
Kenny Rogers,"One time I drove to see a girl across the country
One night as I was driving through to Mexico
I had the windows wide open
It was cold and I was crying
And I later laid her on the radio
Then I stopped that side of Tahoe
Through this tiny mining town
At a diner to be filled for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying
Like a heart broke cried a tune
I turned my collar up and went inside.
Well, I saw this smiling waitress
Joshing friendly with these truckers
That give her pats and she gives them shoves
I said: Miss watch that awful crying
Everybody laughed and said:
It's the tomb of the unknown love
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by myself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And on that winter night
I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still, it said:
He lies a young man struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand this true love cheating
So he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up ( right ) above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying from the tomb of the unknown love.
So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came up
I did believe and tried to find
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning
Warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, didn't they put their shackles on me
And they'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me 'cause it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me at this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and meet alone
These words that forgive them up to, and it'll say:
He lies a young man.",Tomb of the Unknown Love
Kenny Rogers,"It's been a long time since I walked
Through this old town
But oh how the memories start to flow
And there's the old movie house
They finally closed it down
You could find me there every Friday night
Twenty years ago.

I worked the counter at the drugstore down the street
But nobody's left there I would know
On Saturday mornings that's where
All my friends would meet
You'd be surprised to know what a dime would buy
Twenty years ago.

[Chorus]
All my memories from those days come gather round me
What I'd give if they could take me back in time
It almost seems like yesterday
Where do the good times go?
Life was so much easier twenty years ago.

I guess I should stop by Mr. Johnson's hardware store
His only son was my friend Joe
But he joined the army back in 1964
How could we know he would never come back
Twenty years ago

[Chorus]",Twenty Years Ago
Kenny Rogers,"I see you here with me
I've waited all my life
For someone like you
Someone to give my heart and soul to.
I look into your eyes
Your love for me
Was such a welcome surprise
I think at last I've found forever.
Oh, What about me? ( I always need you )...
You were my love before
But I need so much more of you.
Time after time
I feel I'm losing my mind
Or maybe this is 
What lovers must go through
It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time
What am I gonna do?
What about me?, oh, What about me?.
No reason to pretend
True love affairs
Don't have to come to an end
The moment we don't
Have all the answers.
I nearly go insane ( oh, I go insane )
Each and every time
I hear you whisper my name ( I feel the same )
When I'm around you.
But what about me? ( I'll always need you )
Oh, what about me? ( I'll always need you )
This is so hard for me
I wanted so much to be with you.

Always leavin' and always gone
Reachin' for the sparkle in the yello' afternoon
Always leavin' and always gone

The image of the girl appears there, clearly upon my mind
Always leavin' and always gone
Lost among the promises of the days I'll never fi-ind
Always leavin' and always gone

I would lose the right to live and turn the pain to si-i-i-in

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.
You have made me what I am, and I am yours.
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you.
Let me hold you in my arms forever more.
You have gone and made me such a fool.
I'm so lost in your love.
And oh, we belong together,
Won't you believe in my song?
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you.
You have come into my life and made me whole.
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning.
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.
In my eyes I see no one else but you.
There's no other love like our love.
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me.
I've waited for you so long.

Kenny Rogers,"Let's go out in a blaze of glory;
All good things must end;
Like two heroes in a story,
Let's go out like we came in –
In a blaze of glory.

Here we are, broken-hearted;
We thought our love would never end;
We fell hard when we got started,
Falling out like we fell in.

Let's go out in a blaze of glory;
All good things must end;
Like two heroes in a story,
Let's go out like we came in –
In a blaze of glory.

Let's don't lie and hurt each other –
That would be our worst mistake;
Once again, let's act like lovers,
One more time for old time's sake

Let's go out in a blaze of glory;
All good things must end;
Like two heroes in a story,
Let's go out like we came in –
In a blaze of glory.

Let's go out in a blaze of glory;
All good things must end;
Like two heroes in a story,
Let's go out like we came in –

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

He can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world
For the good thing he's found

She can do no wrong

If he put her down

When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know

Would it be a sin?

Kenny Rogers,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Kenny Rogers,"So many years' gone
Still I remember
How die I ever let my heart
Believe in one who's never giving love to me
So many years' gone
Love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you change the taste of love for me
You're my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You're the one romance
I've always known in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
I might have saved
The best of me for you
And will have no ending
If we can hold on
I think I've gone this far because of you
Could be no other lovers will do
No one will ever touch me more
I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I save the best of me for you",The Best of Me
Kenny Rogers,"When the lights go down and the music gets pretty
Get that cheek-to-cheek look in your eye
Little boy, go, better grab your honey
Girl, you'd better grab your guy

It's time for dream, dream dancing
Dream, dream dancing

Out on the dance floor everybody's all alone
Just squeeze my hand and then let's close our eyes
And listen to the man play on the saxophone
As we swerve 'cross the floor, just there, stars in the sky

Dream, dream dancing
Dream, dream dancing

Close your eyes, hold me tight
Let the night last forever, let the night last forever
And I don't mind if the sun never shines
And I don't care if tomorrow never comes

As long as we are dream, dream dancing

When the joint shuts down and I'm still feeling up
We go on home for a little cozy cover
For our favorite station on the radio
We'll be dancing close, we'll be dancing slow

Kenny Rogers,"Stranger I know where you'll find her
Down the road from here about a mile and a quarter.
You'll know the place by a shackey barn
That stands in the field by a run-down farm
By a pond, filled up with stagnant water.

Then you'll see a shack nearby, you'll ask yourself
I wonder why it looks so cold, and lifeless all around.
Chimney rocks are fallin' out,it looks as though
The fire's gone out and the biggest part
Of the house is rotted down.

Though Stranger, I ain't seen her lately.
She don't come around here like she used to.
You've got her pictured in your mind,
Pretty, gentle, sweet and kind,
You've practiced every word you're gonna say.

You'll call her name, but she won't hear you,
She's in the graveyard near you.
She died ten years ago, last May.

There was a man she talked about,
A man she had to live without.
Years ago, he just turned and left one day.
He left her with an unborn child,
And a love for him that never died,
And an aching heart,
That sent her to an early grave.

Yes, Stranger I know who you are,
I recognized you from afar,
But you ain't never seen me,
Not one time.
Yes, I know that you're my dad,
From pictures that my Momma had.
And it was me and Momma that you left behind.

Stranger, you will find her there,
In a peaceful sleep on yonder hill.
Where we once walked, as I do still...
To pick her flowers from the field.

Momma don't need you anymore,
And I don't need you like before,
You can go on back to where you went before...
You're just a stranger.



",The Stranger
Kenny Rogers,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life.",Buy Me a Rose
Kenny Rogers,"Little Boy, in a baseball hat
Stands in the field with his ball and bat
Says I am the greatest player of them all
Puts his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up his ball

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The world's so still you can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The world's so still you can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

He makes no excuses, He shows no fears
He just closes his eyes and listens to the cheers

Little boy, in a baseball hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says I am the greatest the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

And the ball goes up like the moon so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the world's so still as still can be
And the baseball falls, and that's strike three

Now it's supper time and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball
Says I am the greatest that is a fact
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that

He says I am the greatest that is understood
But even I didn't know I could pitch that good.",The Greatest

Or the writing on the wall
It's alright there to see
Except someone like me
Who can't see the truth at all.

It takes a special kind of fool
To stand out in the rain
Somewhere in between
Nothing left to lose
And nothing to be gained.

What kind of fool does it take?
To go on loving alone
Like there's some answer in the ruins
Some silver lining to be found.

An even bigger fool might think
You would care if my heart breaks
Before the time that I admit
I'm just the kind of fool love makes.

A wiser one would see
Nothing's gonna change
There's a time for giving up
A time for letting go
To learn from our mistakes.

But I keep holding on to hope
In spite of everything I know

Memories of you, built in each wall
One tender seed still haunt my dreams
Thought I just heard your voice in the hall
The mirrors reflect all the heartache I feel
Smiling photographs, don't seem real

[Chorus: ]
Nothing's been moved, but everything's changed
Each chair is in place, just my life's rearranged
The wind cries your name through each window and door
Love don't live here, love don't live here anymore

The fire alight still glows a pale blue
The mantle is cruel holding pictures of you
Your scent lingers there, in the bed that we shared
The last plant I sent is in bloom
These rooms are unkind to play tricks on my mind
I can see how you've lived without me

That he'd rather roam
The one who said
He'd rather be alone

If I could hold you now

If I could really make you mine

And they carry her away on the wind
And they never make a sound

These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

",My Favorite Things
Kenny Rogers,"Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn'
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh ni-ight divi-ine, oh-oh ni-ight when Christ was born
Oh night divi-ine, oh-oh night, oh-oh night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all of them must praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we
His power and glory-why, ever more proclaim
His power and glor-or-ory-why, ever more-ore-ore proclaim...


Oh-oh..., oh-oh..., oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh...

Kenny Rogers,"Sweet, little Jesus boy
They made You be born in a manger-er
Sweet little Holy child
They didn't know who You were

Didn't know You'd come to save us Lord
To take our sins away 
Our eyes were blind
And we could not see
We didn't know who You were

A long time ago
You were born in a manger, Lord
Sweet little Jesus Boy (Sweet Jesus boy)
Now the world treated You mean, Lord
And it's been treatin' me mean too
But that's how things are done now, yeah (Sweet)

Kenny Rogers,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn'
This comes to pass
When a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds of change whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn
This comes to pass
When a child is born

A rosey hue settles all around
You got the feel, you're on solid ground
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn
This comes to pass
When a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting
Waiting for one child, black, white, yellow - no one knows
But a child that will grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbour
And misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten, forever

It's all a dream, an illusion now
It must come true sometime soon somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn'
This comes to pass
When a child is born
This comes to pass
When - a child - is bor-or-orn...
Is bor-or-orn...

Kenny Rogers,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply

As time goes by
And when two lover's woe
They still say I love you
And that you can rely

No matter what the future
Brings, as time go by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date

Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman meets man
And man must have his mate

That no one can deny

[Chorus]
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Kenny Rogers,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Kenny Rogers,"Real love is the only thing I know
The changes of everything at touches
It gets you and it's gentle clutches
But that's not really the heart of the matter
Everybody, every now and then
We'll say that they can use
Some side of two
Even though you're setting
Kind of roam
That's not really the heart of the matter
I think I'm really the heart of the matter
Isn't it natural going away to think I'll be alone
I think of you
Your love for me is gone
I think that's really the heart of the matter after all

some nights I lay really easy on my mind
You might hold your billow in my cry
That's not the heart of the matter",Heart of the Matter
Kenny Rogers,"What we're looking at here is a harder situation
Let me make it quite clear
There must be no hesitation
Either you're with me or you're not
Are we gonna lose a love we got?

When I called you last night
Words got tangled in the wires
It was hanging me up
Wondering which one was the liar
But if you want honesty from me
This is the way it's got to be, ooh

Heart to heart we should be
Like a melody in harmony
Heart to heart, can't you see
We're a rhapsody, baby, you and me
Heart to heart, heart to heart to heart.

Open your eyes
Can't you see that you're in danger
Say it goodbye, turning lovers into strangers
We'd be fools if let this go
And all we gotta do is let the feelings flow, ooh.

Heart to heart '

Hurting one another is the easy thing to do
You turn your back on love and walk away

If you only knew it's right before your eyes
When will you realize'",Heart to Heart
Kenny Rogers,"Life is a hustle, every day struggle
Pushing your way at the top
Gotta keep it on track and never look back
And no, you don't dare stop.

There's someone behind you keeping an eye on you
Hoping you take a fall, a lady, she's liked to see me more
But I can't slow down at all.

She says: 
Wow, I need some time alone
I say: no, we gotta keep pushing on
She said: life is good, love is better?

My daddy, he always preached to me
You gotta reach for the sky
Make rain while the sun is shining
Boy, don't let it pass you by

Money and power is in your hand
You can do what you wanna be
Oh, my baby, she?s got a different philosophy.

She says:
Now I know my sweet lady must be heaven sent
I just cover the meaning of what she meant
I've been working so hard for the good life but I headed all the while
I've found my hiding treasure, baby, right there in this smile.

I say: 
Wow, seems we've spent time alone

I say: 
Wow, how our love has grown
She was right all alone

I say: 
Life is good, love is better?","Life Is Good, Love Is Better"
Kenny Rogers,"I think of all the times, I needed you
And you would come to me, 'cause you wanted too
And we built the fire that would last through the night
Still be burnin' in the morning light.


Oh, it must have had a thousand ways
Of takin' our breath away
We took a chance or two, didn't we?
And made some mountains move, oh, didn't we?

From out of the blue storm clouds came
And it started rainin', we just let it rain
Oh, it must've been a careless love
Oh, it had to be a careless love
Satin sheets, and no regrets
We had it baby, we had the best, didn't we?.

And every now and then
I let my feelings show
And though takes me a while
Just to let you go
'Cause you were more than a lover
And more than a friend
Never before and never again.

Oh, it must've been 

Oh, it ought to be you and me
Oh, we had a good, didn't we
Didn't we, didn't we?",Didn't We?
Kenny Rogers,"All my memory is safely packed
And my dreams are neatly folded away
I've got nothing to show
To a love that might have told okay
All the tables and chairs
They're standing empty and bare
And there isn't any sign
You were here
So just walk out of the door
Try not to get too near

You might look in my eyes
And see all the pain
And sadness deep inside
Don't look in my eyes
That's where I keep the tears I can't hide
If you've just gone, it'll be alright
I know I'll get through the night
And I even smile
As we say our goodbyes
Just don't look in my eyes

All our photographs are stored away
And our letters are there burned in the fire
There's nothing left here
That make me believer
We had nights of tender love and desire
If this seems to be gray
I'd like to hide away
There's nothing to remind me of you
When you walk out of the door
Just be sure whatever you do

Don't look in my eyes
And see all the pains
And sadness deep inside
Don't look in my eyes
That's where I keep the tears I can't hide
If you've just gone, it'll be alright
I know I'll make it through the night
And I even smile
As we say our goodbyes
Just don't look in my eyes",Don't Look in My Eyes
Kenny Rogers,"Two different worlds, somehow
Found a way to come together
Moving so close until now
When we find ourselves alone
So it's one more lonely night
I tried to feel like it was over

But just the thought of losing you
And the emptiness is more than I can take
Living without loving you
My senses all break down
Girl I'm lost at just the thought
Of losing you

All of my life, no one else
Ever meant enough to hold me
I've been afraid of myself
For the way I've needed you
You've been waiting much too long I know
No I don't need to think it over

Through the tears you stand beside me
It hurts too much to think of you leaving me

Just the thought of losing you
And the emptiness
Is more than I can take
Just the thought of losing you
And I close my eyes
I can't see it end this way

Just the thought of losing you
",Just the Thought of Losing You
Kenny Rogers,"I never thought that it would end this way
Somehow it'd always go home
And yet this morning when I reached for her
She was gone.
I never asked for any promises
I knew she'd always be there
I swear somebody must be loving at me somewhere.

Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
How can this be?
She said: she'd always be there for me
Love, love
Somebody took my love, love
We set us free
You don't know what she means to me.

I never saw a single morning sun
When did it catch her her heart
How could I ever have let him break us apart.
I feel so helpless and so out of touch
There's no escape in this pain
But in my heart I know
She can't be the one to blame.

Love, love ...

So cold, spending my nights alone
Somebody hears me calling your name
Somebody sent you home.",Somebody Took My Love

He was just a ragged soldier out there in the cold
But he seemed to have a purpose only known to him
As he walked along the streets that night through the town of Bethlehem.

In his head he held a memory of all the wars he'd known
In his hand he clutched a medal for the bravery he'd shown
And the weight of every battle he carried in his heart
But his eyes were clear and searching for a manger in the dark.

[Chorus]
Some are born to greatness, some are born to fall
Some are bound to be forgotten like they never lived at all
But we're all born to know Him and stand before His light
Like the soldier who found his king tonight.

He had marched for politicians, served under their command
And he fought for all the causes that he did not understand
But it was something deep inside him now that led him on his way
With a single star to guide him to were the baby lay.

[Chorus]

He stood before the Son of God, come to pay our debt
He smiled up at the soldier that the world would soon forget
So he held out his medal and said this for you I bring
There he swore allegiance to the newborn baby King.

Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter but I finally quit livin on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there be-side me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.
After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cos the words that told her
Kept coming back time after time
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times

Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place.
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
 
And you decorated my life, created a world Where dreams are a part.
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart,
You decorated my life
 
Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song,
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me
until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise,
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be
shinin' soft in our eyes
 
And you decorated my life, created a world Where dreams are a part.
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart,
You decorated my life

Kenny Rogers,"You won't believe where I was today
Something made my car go a different way
Before I knew it
I was back in time at our old address

Sitting in the drive
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon

At 727 East Magnolia Avenue
They added on where we thought we would
You always said it would sure look good
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall

Looks like they picked up right where we left off
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun
I could see us there together

Seemed the sky was always blue
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue
If I could make one wish
Oh, I'd relive my life with you
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue",727 East Magnolia Avenue
Kenny Rogers,"When my home is, so far away;
And I miss you, so bad it hurts;
When I feel like, I've lost my way;
I know where to go to quench my thirst;

[Chorus]
Back to the well for a drink of cool, cool water;
Back to the arms where my heart first fell,
Back to the place my loving cup runs over,
Back to my love, back to the well

Cross the ocean, and around the world;
I've logged a million, country miles;
But I always come back to the girls,
Who makes it all worth while

[Chorus: x 2]

Back to my love, back to the well",Back to the Well
Kenny Rogers,"The wait turned into hours
Before you came my way
The smile that filled a daddy's heart 
On the special day
The moment left me speechless
I didn't know what to say
Then you took your first breath
That took mine away

Days go by so quickly
Summer turns to fall
Seems like only yesterday
That you began to crawl
So don't be afraid to take that step
I'll catch you when you fall
I don't mind if you leave behind
A few hand prints on the wall

I can't describe this feeling 
Way down deep inside
The itsy-bitsy spider
Was the first thing that we tried
Patty cake, the baker's man
With your hands so very small
You could always stay this young
And I wouldn't mind at all

Days go by so quickly
Summer turns to fall

Kenny Rogers,"Well, a hammer fell down on a .44 Primer
And that was one less problem in South Carolina tonight
Wrong or right

She just looked to me as she finished her tale
The blank expression went another pale shade of gray
There was nothing to say

In the shadows of her face I saw the scars
That you get when you live where love is hard
And she said

Don`t you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don`t you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

Well, I put the cuffs on her and sat her in the car
Walked inside, he was layin' on the floor stone dead
Been shot in the head

There were whiskey bottles and dope by the chair
A starving baby with nothing to wear but tears
So the picture was clear

He had finally pushed her way across the line
And the badge I wore was losing all its shine
And she said

Don`t you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don`t you shrug it off until you've walked a mile in my bare feet
There are people that you pass by every day
With harder cards than yours in life to play

I just stood there thinkin' how justice is blind
But after thirty five years you learn to read the signs
So I made up my mind

I took the cuffs of her and I walked her back in
Wiped the gun off and wrapped it in his right hand
Where it should've been

And the morning paper read in black and white
It`s just another senseless case of suicide
Suicide

Oh, but don`t you sit and judge me from some high and mighty seat
Don`t you shrug it off until you've walked a mile along my beat

Kenny Rogers,"By the time you read this letter
I'll be gone
I'm not the man I was when I left home
By the time you see my face
I will have aged
Much more than the passing of the days

This many miles might as well be the moon
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you
My heart can't believe what my eyes they have seen
God knows what's pulling us through
In a world gone insane, I've whispered your name
I'm missing you

Sometimes in the quiet of the night
I reach for you as if you're by my side
When everything around me seems all gone
The thought of holding you keeps me hangin' on

This many miles might as well be the moon
It's a desolate place and I'm missing you

Kenny Rogers,"Is it still love when we no longer touch?, 
Passing white sheets in the night, 
Love goes unspoken, we don't say a word, 
We simply turn out the lights.
Lost in the silence but still I can hear, 
The sound of my own breaking heart, 
I can't pretend that my world isn't falling apart.

And I don't wanna go through love like this, 
'Cause I won't ever know what I might have missed.
I wanna burn with desire, 
I want to feel the fire when we kiss, 
But I don't wanna go through love like this.

I still remember the taste of your skin, 
The sound of you saying my name, 
The way that it felt as we laid in the sand, 
And passion came crashing like waves.
The wind of your laughter, the longing, 
The love lead us to lacking inside
There must be some way for lovers to turn the trash.

'Cause I don't wanna go

Like strangers living like two people 
Who'd never known what is like to be loved.

I want to burn with desire; 
I want to feel the fire of every kiss
But I don't wanna go through love,
No, I'm not gonna go through love,
I'm not willing to go through love like this.",Love Like This

Kenny Rogers,"We only knew each other by letter, 
When I met her over the train, 
When the smoke cleared and the dust was still, 
She was standing there speaking my name.

I guarantee she looked like an angel, 
I couldn't think of what I should say, 
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden, 
I believe he felt the selfsame way.

I handed her up on the wagon, 
And I loaded up her trunk behind, 
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair, 
I tried to get a hope on my mind.

You think that you could love me, Mary? , 
You think we got a chance of a life, 
Do you think that you could love me, Mary? 
Now you are to be my wife.

We finally headed out of the station, 
And drove up my home trail, 
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm, 
I thought my resolution would fail.

Now froze as she stepped through the doorway, 
And I stood there as still as could be, 
I said: ""I know, it ain't much it needs a woman's touch, 
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me.""

Do you think that ...

We had a prairie wedding, 
There was a preacher and a neighbor or two, 
I gave my golden thing, a gold wedding ring, 
And the both of us said, ""I do"".

Now when the sun is going down in the prairie, 
And the golden hair is a flame, 
I say ""do you really love me, Mary?"" 
I hold her and I whisper her name.

Do you think that...",Prairie Wedding
Kenny Rogers,"One man can't sleep in his penthouse bed, 
Wall Street worries fill his head, 
While another man dreams, 
In his cardboard shed on Broadway.

Early morning traffic jam, 
Wake up call for both of them, 
Will work to eat 
Asks easy street for small change.

And which one needs it more, 
The rich man or the poor, 
A change of heart and attitude, 
Unselfishness meets gratitude.

It's enough to put tears in God's eyes, 
Enough to make the angels cry, 
When the power of love lifts someone above, 
The emptiness of their unbearable life, 
It's enough to put tears in God's eyes.

Late at night a baby cries, 
His mother gives him life then dies, 
But no one even by them to be sad.
And another woman fills the need, 
It's her heart and his mouth she'll feed, 
When she gives her love to the child she never had.

Oh, and which one needs it more, 
It's hard to say for sure, 
When something grows, when nothing was 
As strong as any bond of blood.

It's enough to put '

And lets it shine like the sun,

Cussed your name just a no
Count share croppin colored man
Who would steal anything he can
And they always laid the blame on Ruben James

The faded skirt the weathered brow
The calloused hand up on the plow
I loved you then and I love you now Ruben James

Gray, a gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black
It was you that would not turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name, Ruben James

Ruben James, with your mind on my soul
And the bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
A better world is a waiting for the meek
In my head those words remain from Ruben James

Kenny Rogers,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on 
You do something to me that I can't explain 
Hold me closer and I feel no pain 
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on 
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We can ride it together, ah ha 
Making love with each other, ah ha 
 
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between 
How can we be wrong 
Sail away with me 
To another world 
And we rely on each other, ah ha 
From one lover to another, ah ha 
 
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one 
And you walk in the night 
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry 
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
Making love with each other, ah ha

Kenny Rogers,"You can run, you can hide,
And never let him inside,
Just living your life in the dark.
Sooner or later, that gentle persuader,
Is gonna catch up with your heart.
Make you a dreamer, believer,
Believing in love.

Right when a man's doing all that he planned,
And he thinks he's got just what he needs,
Life will deliver a shot that will shiver,
And drive him right down to his knees.
Make him start giving, living,
Living again.

Well it's your mind that tricks
You into leaving every time.
Love will turn you around, turn you around.
Well it's your heart that talks
You into staying where you are.
Love will turn you around, turn you around.

Out of the blue she reaches to you,
And you tell her you don't have the time.
So you move away fast, but you know it won't last,
Cause you can't get it off your mind.
Thoughts are burning, turning,
Turning around.

How do you know when to stay or go,
And how do you know when it's real.
You don't need a sign to make up your mind,
You got your heart at the wheel.
You want to start sharing, caring,
Caring again.

Well it's your mind that tricks
You into leaving every time.

I woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag within
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)

I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I saw so much I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)

Someone painted ""April Fool"" in big black letters on a ""Dead End"" sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind

Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere

Kenny Rogers,"An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing 
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",Letter to Heaven

She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.

My baby makes me smile, Lord don't she make me smile
She's never too far away or too tired to say I want you
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights, 
She's still a baby to me.

An' we watched a US President get caught
We watched shareholders watch their savings vanish

Was a crooked cap on curly hair
An' some kid squintin' back at me

I said, ""If you're sellin' somethin'
Well, I ain't buyin' nothin'
But I appreciate you stoppin' by""
Said, ""I ain't askin' for a dime just a minute of your time

Keep Uncle Joe an' those soldiers safe
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat
Put a stop to bullies on the bus
No crime, no waits, no hate, no drugs
Give a jacket and a job to people on the street""

I said, ""Son, sounds like a world I'd like to live in""
And I signed his petition

When she called, said she was late
So we took a little drive upstate
And took care of that
Yeah, just took care of that

But now I'm lookin' back at some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living with water & bridges

Now my old man, he had it rough
'Cause like his daddy when he drank too much
He'd get mean
And take it out on me

So with angry words, I was gone
I never even tried to go back home
The night he died
Momma said he apologized

Now I'm lookin' back on some of my decisions
Now that it's much too late to change
How a father could have held his son
If I could undo what's been done
But I guess everyone is living with water & bridges

We could all go crazy from
Things that only time can dull
I guess, that's why everyone is given
Water & bridges, water & bridges
Water & bridges

Kenny Rogers,"The night will start to fall, you'll lie awake
Recalling every tender thing she said
You'll think about her laugh, her touch, her smile
Becomes a photograph you can't forget, not just yet

You're gonna know that night
When you reach out and she's not there
And there's more pain than your heart can bear
Love's just a river till you've crossed it

Suddenly everything in your life feels wrong
You're alive but the reason's gone
You'll know love when you've lost it

You'll know the taste of tears, you know you will
For years 'cause there's a truth you can't get past
Some bridges will not burn but some corners must
Be turned, so you can love again at last and not look back

Still until that that night
When you reach out and she's not there
And there's more pain than your heart can bear
Love's just a river 'till you've crossed it

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
With them windshield wipers slappin' time, And Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang every song that driver knew, yeah

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free, 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah

And that blue train won't bring my baby home

And makin' sure supper's on before he makes it home
In her mind she hears him say, ?I'm gonna make it better someday?

He will, she knows
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't 
He will, she knows

He spends all day under a hood makin' Chevrolet's run like they should
He don't like it much, but the pay is good and that's enough to make him stay
He's workin lot's of overtime ?cause he's got a little plan in mind
For a hill off highway 109 that he drives by everyday
Sometimes money's hard to save but if anyone can find a way

There's a million things I don't remember
But that's the one thing that I won't forget.

It might've been a Saturday night
It was either my folks car or yours
I know that we went to some drive-in
What was playing that night I'm not sure
But I am sure you whispered you loved me
As my lips softly pressed against your neck.

There's a million ...

After a while I guess we agreed
We had wings we needed to test
Somehow we talked ourselves out of love
That such close to love as I've gotten yet.

It was 2:21 on a Sunday 
And I found myself standing in the rain

Inside I was dying to stop you

And not my head.",I Won't Forget

How much you really mean to me
So I'll tell you with no uncertainty.

With all my heart, with all my soul
I will love you 'til the winds don't blow
Until the oceans turn to stone
I am yours and yours alone

Life comes between your heart and mine
When it appears I've shut you out
Remember this, you're all that really counts.

Get in my way, when I do,

That nothing else could touch

You'd have to go back, and teach me how when I was nine 
Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball even if she had the time
I should have been learning how to fish, instead of learning how to smoke
I bet if you'd of whooped my tail, I'd never thought it was a joke 
He said sometimes the will for doing wrong is way too strong for any mama's prayers 
You had to be there

The man said, boy, I'm sorry that you hate me like you do 
The boy said dry it up man, we ain't making this about you
Its about a teenage girl against the world cause she was left there high and dry 
Its about a kid who might have stood a whole lot better shot at life

Kenny Smilovitch,"Finally found a fella
Almost completely divine
But his vocabulary
Is killin' this romance of mine
We get into an intimate situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation

He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Ev'ry time we kiss
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
At a time like this
He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Solid,"" he says
Takes me in his arms
And says, ""Solid,"" he says
Meanin' all my charms

He says, ""Murder,"" he says
Keep it up like this
And that's, ""Murder,"" he says

It will bring on nobody's murder but his own

And my name's Marie
He says, ""Jackson,"" he says
'Shoot the snoot to me'

He says, ""Woof, woof,"" he says
When he likes my hat
He says, ""Tsk, tsk,"" he says
What the heck is that?
He says, ""Wooh, wooh,"" he says
Is that the language of love?

He says, ""Hep, hep, with helium
Now babe, we're cookin'""

He says, ""We're in da groove
And da groove is good lookin'""
He sounds like his uppers don't fit

Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.

Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Returns for us at last.

Fading on the grass.

Kenny Vance,"At Erasmus Hall High School, we used to harmonize
Me and Benny and Aaron and two Italian guys
We were singing oldies, but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's, I remember when

We'd practice in a subway, in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway, singing doo wops to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom, and nobody could get in

'Cause we were looking for an echo, an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony
A place we almost found

And the girls would gather 'round us, and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the Moonglows, the Harptones, and the Dells
And when we sang ""Sincerely,"" we really sang it high
Even though it was falsetto, we almost reached the sky

We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonize
Now we've turned into oldies, but we were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's, I remember when

We were looking for an echo, an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony
A place we almost found",Looking for an Echo
Kenny Vehkavaara,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way

Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again

Kenny Vehkavaara,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack

To try to save myself

Kenny Wayne Shepherd,"When, when the first light finally broke 
and I could see
Lost, I wasn't lost at all, just wasn't 
where I thought I'd be

If I'm strong enough
if I live long enough
I just might come this way again
And I've been here before
All I know for sure 
Is I'm gone like smoke

Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls
(You might find me)
Rising from the ashes 
You never know (I might be there)
Always been willing to outstare 
the darkness
Dig the well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it 
takes me
Anywhere the wind blows

Then, then I began to walk across the 
shifting sand
Search, search for a drink that 
wouldn't kill a drowning man
And every step I take
Every choice I make
I'm that much further 'round the bend
I don't wave goodbye, 
there's not need to cry
That's how I go

Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls (You might find me)
Rising from the ashes 
You never know (I might be there)
Always been willing to outstare 
the darkness
Dig the well deeper than it needs to go
Always been ready to roll where it takes me
Anywhere, anywhere the wind blows

I won't tell you lies
And I won't dry your tears
You can wonder why
But I'll be far from here

If I'm strong enough, 
if I live long enough
I just might pass this way again
And I've been here before
All I know for sure 
Is I'm gone like smoke

Anywhere the wind blows
Anywhere the rain falls

Kenny Wayne Shepherd,"Baby, sometimes the rain must fall
Somethings in this world you can't change at all

Shattered all around

If I could I would chase all the clouds away
Make every shadow fade
And I'll build a place, there'd be no tears at all
Sometimes baby, the rain must fall

And baby, this thing called gravity
Baby, keeps us prisoners on the ground
The world can get so heavy on your shoulders
Hey, that it might break it down

Men jag minns våra skrikiga stolar I köket
Och virveln på min kula av porslin
Min vän hade kritvita tänder
Hans kläder luktade rök
Så levande att det ibland känns
Som om det är jag som är död

Låg så tungt I min hand
En dank Frank
Jag kommer aldrig närmare än så

Som att nicka en fotboll I mål
Som att kasta en sten högt över taken
Och klättra dit ingen kan nå
Långsamt glömmer man bort allt
Också träskor och gul blend I smyg
Men inte saker han sa som gjorde mig större
Inte så blyg
På hans jacka satt fyra märken
Hjältar I glittrande tyg
Slade Kiss Bowie & Sweet, året när pinups var ny

It wasn't that easy

Take it frame by frame again

You're creased and lined

When you know that my whole life depends
On you (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Never cast that cross aside

Never let other people lead you astray
Teach His words to them if you can
They must think of that cross on which Jesus died
And get ready to meet Him someday

Remember the cross on which Jesus died
Follow in His footsteps each day
He shed His blood for you and He shed His blood for me
Never cast that cross aside

When Jesus comes down from heaven above
And You haven't thought of that cross
He'll cast you aside in the twinkling of an eye
And you won't see His blessed home of love

Kentucky Thunder,"All night I've wrestled Jacob's angels
And prayed with Matthew, Luke and John
Struggling to find the words you face the task
That comes upon the blood red dawn.

I've buried men before their time
Of alcohol and blackened lung
But how to bury seven of these
Appalachian miners sons.
Who stormed the beaches wave on wave,
And sailed home to these rocky graves
In family plots that bared their names.

Tomorrow I'll walk up, seven hillsides
Tremble before my flock on seven hillsides
Seven sorrows, seven sons, seven mothers and every one
Will turn to me for the word of God, what does this mean?
And there I'll stand good book in hand,
A shepherd to these precious lambs
What will I say, what will I say, what can I say?

To tell the truth I'd never thought much
About the will of God before.
Called to preach at seventeen
I was in love with fiery words and not much more.
The time has come to keep the faith
For others shattered by their loss.
Remind them of the loving God
Whose son like theirs paid the cost.
To save a sad and wicked world
Through sacrifice our love is heard
And pray that I believe those words.

J'essaie de rester forte, notre histoire me harcèle
J'imagine ta vie loin de la mienne
J'essaie de faire le vide, tes mots reviennent sans cesse.

Qu'est-ce qu'il fait, qui il voit?
À quoi ressemble son quotidien loin de mes bras?
Dites-moi, où il va?
Retourne t-il sur les lieux de nos rendez-vous d'autrefois?

Il faut que je répare tout ce que tu as détruit
Tu entres dans ma vie et tu repars sans rien dire
Ton odeur flotte encore dans mes souvenirs
Prends tes mots, tes promesses et laisse-moi me reconstruire.

Que faut-il que je fasse, pour qu'il sorte de ma tête?
Il a volé mon cœur et a rendu ma vie amère
Il faut que je m'éloigne, que j'oublie ma tristesse
Tout me ramène à lui, j'ai l'impression de me perdre.

Je ne veux vivre dans le passé
Je ne suis plus vraiment là, car pour moi, le temps s'est arrêté
Son odeur enivre toutes mes journées
Je me noie dans son regard et je m'égare dans l'océan des regrets.

C'est pas facile la vie de chantier mais il avance
Sans jamais se plaindre
C'est à 27 ans qu'il a débarqué en France

Ici les combats font rages,
Déjà plus d’une année passée loin de toi
Je ne compte plus le nombre de fois,
Où j’ai relu tes lettres pour y trouver ton soutien
C’est dans ton sourire que je puise la force de me battre
Jamais un hiver ne m’a paru aussi froid
Un jour, je reviendrais, inchallah

Je lis ta lettre, et des larmes coulent de mes yeux
Des perles salées, roulent sur mes joues
Le papier se froisse sous mes doigts,
Déjà plus d’un an loin de toi
À chacune des lettres du front,
Je tremble, j’ai peur, j’ai froid,
Je te revois, fier en uniforme
Sur le quai de la gare, paré à partir
Tu m’as promis de revenir, j’ai promis de te soutenir
Tu puises la force de te battre, dans mes yeux et mon sourire

Oh!
Avant l'armée, j'étais armé, dans le quartier j'ai formé
L'équipe la plus cramé, les keufs étaient alarmés
Zharma on a cané, les mecs les plus chtarbés
Srab je n'ai pas peur de te fumer, pour m'affirmer
Ensuite 3 ans ferme, la prison m'a enfermée
J'ai vu ceux qui m'aimaient mieux qu'au travers d'une bière de quartier
Des pleurs je vais t'épargné
En m'engageant au front je voulais tourner,
La page avant que l'on me retrouve contourné
Au Rwanda, au proche orient je me suis aspiré
Au Darfour ma vie a changé, les courses a carrefour
J'écris sur mon carnet le déroulement de chaque jour
Pour que tu puisses comprendre ce que je ressent durant mes journées
T'inquiet la ""salat"" j'ai pas détourné 
Tu me connais, je suis borné, l'odeur de la mort m'y a renfermé
Dire déjà un an que je suis parti, pfff le temp y passe chanmé
J'écris cette lettre entre l’assaut d'un cocktail molotova

Tu me décris ta vie là-bas au fond des tranchés,
Tu parles d’une odeur qui flotte celle de la mort
Et tu t’étais fait des amis, ils ont disparu aujourd’hui
Tu évites de m’en parler, tu ne veux pas que je me fasses du soucis
Tu rêves la nuit, de mon visage, d’autres paysages
Dans ton cœur tout est détruit, reste mon image
Nous sommes en plein mois de décembre
Un second hiver loin de toi
La neige a la couleur du sang
Mes mains sont brûlées par le froid

Je t’écris cette énième lettre pour que tu comprennes que c’est la dernière
Car derrière moi des tirs fuses, je les repousse en arrière
La guerre n’a pas de barrière, je l’ai appris hier
Quand une balle c'est logé dans mes artères, je suis parterre 
Je vais partir, je t’embrasse toi, embrasses mes supporteurs morts
Avec la manière, et le cœur d’un bulldozer 
J’ai compris, qu’au casting de la mort, y a pas que la misère
Qui postule, j’emmène ton visage à titre posthume 

Loin de tes yeux, les miens ne voient plus rien,
Mon cœur ne bat plus, sans le rythme du tien
Reviens-moi, je t’en pris, les souvenirs m’assaillent
Pourquoi donner ta vie sur un champ de bataille?
Loin de tes yeux, les miens ne voient plus rien,
Mon cœur ne bat plus, sans le rythme du tien
Reviens-moi, je t’en pris, les souvenirs m’assaillent
Tu as donné ta vie sur un champ de bataille?

Un jour, je reviendrais

Ils grandissent et deviennent en y mettant les formes,

Kenza Farah,"J'ai tout fait, tout, tout fait
Mais à croire que ce n'est pas assez à en croire les reproches,
Moi j'ai tout fait,
J'ai toujours avancé avec le cœur sur la main, ma famille et mes proches,
J'ai tendu la main, tendu la perche,
À des amis qui ne m'ont tendus que des pièges,
J'ai tendu l'oreille et j'ai entendu,
bien entendu qu'ils ne voulaient que mon siège,
Il devient compliqué de croire à une parole,
Qui ne provient pas de la bouche d'un enfant
J'ai confié mes secrets ils m'ont donnés leur parole,
Ils les ont gardés le temps que brûlent l'encens,
J'ai appris à lire entre les sourires,
les je t'aime et les tu me manques tant,
J'ai appris a rire entres les soupirs,
entre les je saigne, entre les tu reviens quand,

Je vois la vie tel un champ de bataille,
ou tel un champ de mines écoute le chant de mes entrailles,
Donner sa vie sur les champs d'honneur
et ignorer ses peurs grâce aux chants des massailles,
Je vois la vie tel un champ de bataille, un champ de mines,
un chant de ruines écoute le chant de mes entrailles,
Donner sa voix sur les champs d'honneur
et face aux chants des calibres laissez-moi le chant libre.

J'ai tout vu, j'ai du même traverser des océans de larmes pour y arriver,
Moi j'ai tout su car ici tout se sait,
derrière tout se dit mais devant tout se tait,
J'ai tiré un trait sur des fréquentations
car du droit chemin elles avaient déviés,
Pour éviter que naissent les réputations
dis-moi avec qui tu traînes je te dirai qui tu es
J'avance dans ce milieu sur une corde raide,
Sans jamais demander de l'aide,
J'ai plus d'une corde à mon arc
Je ne fais pas partie des faibles, de ceux qui cèdent,
toujours la tête haute même face aux ""monard""
Si ma vie à moi c'est de chanter (lalala),
Qui pourra un jour m'en empêcher?
C'est la guerre dans la vie, c'est comme sur le terrain,
En tête du classement, et jamais repêcher,

Je vois la vie tel un champ de bataille
ou tel un champ de mines écoute le chant de mes entrailles,
Donner sa vie sur les champs d'honneur,
et ignorer ses peurs face aux chants des massailles,
Je vois la vie tel un champ de bataille,
un champ de mines, un champs de ruines écoute le chant de mes entrailles,
J'ai donné ma voix sur les champs d'honneur

C'est avec toi que je me vois
Grandir chaque jour
Dans tes bras j'aime me blottir
Et ça pour toujours

Let me be with you
Let me be with you, let me be with you

Let me be with you, let me be with you
Let me be with you
Let me be with you, let me be with you
Let me be with you

Avec toi le temps qui passe
Ne m'effraie pas
Il me suffit de fermer les yeux
Et tu es là
Avec toi je veux croire aux promesses
Que la vie me fait
J'ai l'impression de te connaître
Depuis des années

Je n'ai pas assez de mots pour te dire
Oh combien je t'aime
Chaque mot que tu prononces
Sonne comme un poème
Comme un ange tombé du ciel
Tu veilles sur moi
Je ne veux plus jamais, plus jamais, plus jamais
Être loin de toi

Let me be with you, let me be with you
Let me be with you
Let me be with you, let me be with you
Let me be with yau
Let me be with you, let me be with you
Let me be with you
Let me be with you, let me be with you

Just you and me, love will always love forever
Just you and me, I just hope we'll stay together
Just you and me, you my one and only lover
Just you and me, just you and me

Viens découvrir notre vie et la grand place que tien la famille
Faites le tour du monde en changeant simplement de bâtiment
Chez nous les gens paient avec le sourire et pas l'argent (et pas l'argent)
Les poches vides et le cœur aussi grand que l'océan

Dándole a la botella la yerba buena y el domino
Tienes que ver lo hiere, si ven que se siente (que se siente)
Pa' madrugar, pa' bailar y gozar con mi gente (oye sí)
Vengo de donde vengo no estoy aquí sólo porque quiero
Por eso voy cantando, tumbando y dando, y no tengo miedo
Hay que saber que se puede ganar o te pierdes (o te pierdes)
Por eso quiero llegar a un lugar de repente (dale pasa pa aca atrás)

A trois sur scooter les minots pourraient faire le tour de la terre
Viens dans nos quartiers nord où les tours et les blocs surplombent la mer
Tu y seras reçu comme un roi nous on donne à cœur ouvert
Seulement les ignorants croient que chez nous on doit marcher à couvert

Vamos a ver lo que hay (hey) entre la V de verdad, 
Para que puedas hablar (hey) sin tener que repetir.
Vas a notar cómo cambia la luz del momento (del momento)
Porque verás gente buena brillando por dentro, gente natural.

Ay en el gueto, vamos a cantar en el gueto (roncito chico)
Ay ay ay en el gueto (en el gueto), si me buscan 'toy en el gueto

En eux résonne cette envie de chevaucher la nuit
Comme un appel a la fête comme un appel au délit
L'obscurité les envoûtés et les envahis
Entre les flics les femmes de joies et les épiceries de nuit
Sous les réverbères et la lune les ombres se dessines
Pour mieux lécher les vitrines ou les casser il s'enfuient
Car la nuit nous cache elle masque nos visages et elle étouffe les bruits

La nuit tout se vends de la main a la main 
Et jamais dans les magasins
La nuit les girofards nous ouvrent le chemin

La nuit on passe sous les porches ou se partages des butins 
On entends au loin des bruits de herins
La nuit n'a peur de rien a par du lendemin matin

Minuit on a la même couleur de peau
Minuit la nuit a gommé tous nos défauts
Minuit nos ? nous collent a la peau
Minuit le compteur repart a zéro
Minuit éclaire ? sous les étoiles
Minuit envoi parfois nos frères au cachot
La nuit nous emprisonnent, en nous elle a tissé sa toile

J'attends toujours que sonne ce foutu bipper

Je dois me préparer au pire

Allô c’est moi, mon bipper viens de sonner, j’ai un donneur

À ton réveil je voudrais que tu saches l’honneur que j'ai eu d’être à tes côtés
La chance de m'être levé à côté d’une telle beauté
J’ai passé les cinq plus belles années de ma vie
Mais l’ai-je mérité
Loin de vivre au paradis
Quand j’y réfléchi avec du recul
Nos engueulades, nos prises de bec, ridicules
Aujourd’hui j’en rigole avec une larme au coin de l’œil bébé
Repense à tout ça pour pouvoir faire ton deuil bébé
Pardonne-moi de ne pas avoir été à tes côtés
Mais quand j’ai su que j'étais compatible
Je n’ai pas hésité, 1 seconde à être le donneur
Désormais c'est pour la vie que je suis ton coup de cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

Prends ma main
Serre-la fort
J'ai si peur
Reste auprès de moi mon cœur

They delight in fighting duels.
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels.

May be quite continental,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental

But get that ice or else no dice.

He's your guy 
When stocks are high,
But beware when they start to descend.

It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic,
But diamonds are a girl's best friend.

And I think affairs 
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets 
If little pets get big baguettes.

Time rolls on,
And youth is gone,
And you can't straighten up when you bend.

Or stiff knees,
You stand straight at Tiffany's.

Do we always have to hide away
In a road bin full of stones?

And maybe forgive you
Rather than simply bleed

A flash in the pan as she didn't reply
And he waited for hours
Until she accepted to offer a smile
And a terrible whiskey she had for a while

Since the month of December

They used to tango
Jump and parade until midnight or more

Drink lemonade with some awkward liquor
The she kissed him goodbye and attended the shore
Where she lit a big fire like never before

Stepping through broken bottles and gum
Carrying her shoes, barefoot

Scared everybody away in the end

And lovers tend to break me in two
If you were to come back to me, in pieces or in melody
There couldn't be a better way through

My name is trouble, my first names a mess
No need to greet me, I'm here to confess.
That if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you I will love to death

But if you let me hold you I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you I will love you to death",My Name Is Trouble
Keren Ann,"Let alone the breath of wind that you’re bringing,
It’s through the cords of your guitar that I’m singing
It hits me when I hear they say
That today it’s just an ordinary day!
My dizzy heart has never warn me from showing
That when you’re not around my world keeps on going
But here and now I can’t deny it’s been a while
And not a single day goes by.

[Chorus]
I wanna run with you,
Wanna feel the sun with you!

I want it again with you!

It’s not the life that I was hoping to borrow
Know that you and I, we got no tomorrow!
It breaks me when I hear them say
That today is just an ordinary day!

[Chorus: x2]

I wanna run with you,
Wanna feel the sun with you!
I want it again with you!",Run with You
