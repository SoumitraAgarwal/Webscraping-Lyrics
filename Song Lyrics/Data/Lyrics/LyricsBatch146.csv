Glenn Close,"They don't want me any more
They all say I'm through 
Well it's time they knew 

With on look 
I can break your heart 
With one look 
I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role 

No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

This time I'm staying 
I'm staying for good 
I'll be back 
Where I was born to be 
With one look 
I'll be me",With One Look
Glenn Cutler,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Glenn Cutler,"I'm makin' believe that you're in my arms 
Though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talkin' to you
Wish you could hear what I say

And here in the gloom of my lonely room 
We're dancin' like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming
So till my dreams come true

I'll whisper ""Good night""
Turn out the light
And kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you",I'm Making Believe
Glenn Falkenberg,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Glenn Ferris,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still
Glenn Fredly,"Bersamamu kulewati
Lebih dari seribu malam 
Bersamamu yang kumau
Namun kenyataannya tak sejalan

Tuhan bila masih ku diberi kesempatan
Izinkan aku untuk mencintanya
Namun bila waktuku telah habis dengannya
Biar cinta hidup s'kali ini saja

Tak sanggup bila harus jujur
Hidup tanpa hembusan nafasnya

Tuhan bila waktu dapat kuputar kembali
Sekali lagi untuk mencintanya
Namun bila waktuku telah habis dengannya
Biarkan cinta ini (biarkan cinta ini)
Hidup untuk sekali ini saja",Sekali Ini Saja
Glenn Frey,"I woke up shakin' in a cold, cold sweat
I got so much goin' on, what did I forget?
I know there's somethin', but it got so late
I need someone to help me get my story straight

Who told shorty? Who told you?
And who else knows about the things I do?
It's my own business, it's my own fun
So don't you breathe a word of this to anyone

All those lies, I hope I can remember
All those lies, I'm a bad pretender
All those lies, comin' back to haunt me
All those lies, I get the feeling like they want me

Listen, baby, you can take my word
Don't you believe a single lie you've heard
They're all out to get me and then get you
There's just no tellin' what these kind of people will do

They're sayin' certain things behind my back
I can't believe you'd listen to those one eyed jacks
They look you in the eye, say it with a smile
They wanna see you sad and lonely all the while

All those lies, I hope I can remember
All those lies, I'm a bad pretender
All those lies, It's a bad situation
All those lies, try'n' to ruin my reputation

There's some bad wheels in motion, try'n' to run us down
Spreadin' dirty lies in this dirty little town
Ooh baby, you know I wouldn't dare
You know how much I love you, you know how much I care

All those lies, I hope I can remember
All those lies, I'm a bad pretender
All those lies, It's a bad situation
All those lies, tryin' to ruin my reputation
",All Those Lies
Glenn Frey,"Baby, I been thinkin' about you 
I couldn't get to sleep last night 
Maybe I been too long without you 
I'm tryin', but it just ain't right 
I know that I did you wrong 
I can't get it out of my mind 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Baby, I heard all about him 
But I don't want to know his name 
And maybe you got reason to doubt him 
I know his lovin' ain't the same 
I think about you at night 
I can't get you off of my mind 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Baby I know you can hear me 
We gotta give it one more try 
Maybe we thought it was over 
But this love's too strong to die 
I need you to come back home 
I'm layin' it all on the line 
I know that I said that I'm sorry before 
But I beg you to listen this time 
Don't give up. Countin' on you 
Don't give up. If you still love me too 
Don't give up. We can make it somehow 
Don't give up. Don't give up on us now 
Don't give up",Don't Give Up
Glenn Frey,"I never thought it could happen 
It was the furthest thing from my mind 
I just turned my back on a sad love affair 
Was try'n' to leave it all behind 
That's when I met you 
I just couldn't say no 
One look in your eyes 
And I said here I go
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I'd seen so much deceivin' 
I almost stopped believin' 
I'd ever fall in love again 
I was runnin' around hidin' my heart 
Fakin' it with all of my friends 
I was down on my luck 
That's when you came along 
You put me back on my feet 
You got me singin' this song 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
And she loves me in the midnight hour 
You know ever since I found you 
And put my arms around you 
I don't need a doggone thing 
You know that ev'ry day is such a beautiful day 
I want the whole world to dance and sing 
So don't you dare hang your head 
Don't you dare be blue 
If it can happen to me 
It can happen to you 
And you'll be singin' this song 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love 
I found somebody 
I found somebody to love",I Found Somebody
Glenn Frey,"I've been born again 
I'm a brand new man (kind of brand new) 
I've been born again 

Saturday night in the city 
Parties on every block 
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party 
But my party days had to stop 
So brothers you can keep your street life 
Changin' women like you change your clothes 
'Cause every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one 
My love just grows and grows 

[Chorus:]
Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip 
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips 
I've been born again (There's a change in me) 
I've been born again (I said a change, a change) 
I've been born again (There's a change in me) 
I've been born again (I said a change, a change) 
Oh, I'm not a Casanova 
My playin' days are over 

I think I'm gonna start me a fire 
Got my matchbox in my hand 
Burnin' up the pages in my little black book 
Start my life all over again 
I don't need no women in excess 
I can't afford to spread my lovin' around 
'Cause when my woman, she's needin' me by her side 
I just don't want to let her down 

[Chorus]

Now I don't need a lot of women 
Just to prove my manhood 
I got me one special woman 
So I can be the man that I should 

Well a whole lot of women is an ego trip 
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips 
I've been born again (There's a change in me) 
I've been born again (I said a change, a change) 
I've been born again (There's a change in me) 
I've been born again (I said a change, a change)",I've Been Born Again
Glenn Frey,"I know you need a friend
Someone you can talk to
Who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love
There's no easy answer
Only you can say what you're gonna do

I heard you on the phone
You took his number
Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy
The guy who left you crying
Isn't he the one who made you blue

When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you've gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you going back to the one you love
Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over
There's no easy way to see this through
All the broken dreams
All the disappointments
Oh girl, what you gonna do

Your heart keeps saying it's just not fair
But still you've gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you going back to the one you love
Someone's gonna cry when they know they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above",The One You Love
Glenn Frey,"I got sick of my job, sick of my wife
Sick of my future and sick of my life

Glenn Frey,"When I talk to her, I know she doesn't hear me
She seems to be a million miles away
When the lights start to dim she'll be thinking of him
She loves him so, she can't let go

It's been long enough for her to just forget him
But still she sees his face in every crowd
She walks out of the room when they're playing that tune
That's how I know she can't let go

She can't let go though she knows it's really over
She can't let go though she knows he's really gone
And I can't compete with a rose-colored memory
A memory that lingers on and on

I've tried everything but now there's only waiting
For the last dying embers to fade
Oh, she wants to be free but when she's holding me
That's when I know she can't let go
I love her so but she can't let go
",She Can't Let Go
Glenn Frey,"Raindrops fallin' on these hills tonight
I've been drivin' since the mornin' light
It won't be long before those headlights shine
And I'll be missin' that girl of mine
Yesterday, I was safe and warm
Yesterday, I held her in my arms
Now the raindrops fallin'
And I feel like callin'

That Girl
Well there ain't no explainin' what she does for me
It might be somethin' only I can see
Understanding in a quiet way
Undemanding and I got to say
I'm in love, and I know it's for sure
I'm in love, I can't stop thinking of her
Now the raindrops fallin'
And I feel like callin'

That girl
Well I've been callin' that girl for such a long long time
I can't get through, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
I got so much to tell her, I got so much to say
Ooh, I'm gonna love her till my dyin' day
Oh, I'm in love, and I know it's for sure

Glenn Frey,"Lonely girl, rainy night
Lookin' for that number
She needs someone to treat her right

There's plenty of men she could call
But she wants him most of all
Oh God, I hope he's home tonight

She needs a love from a real exciter
She needs the allnighter, the allnighter

He's the one, the one she calls
When she gets that feeling
Some nights she just can't stop herself

He's tough and tender, a soul bender
Ain't no service he can't render
He touches her like nobody else

He brings out the love, love
Love deep inside her, he's the allnighter

Now when all the stimulation
Let's you down, down, down
And there ain't no medication
Layin' around, 'round, 'round

You feel your little heart
Begin to pound and pound
He's a satisfier of that one desire

Other guys come and go
They may try but they don't know
Every girl needs special care

Oh, he's so bad, he's so good
He makes it feel just the way it should
Nobody else can take her there

He's the real thing, the pure delighter
He's the allnighter, the allnighter

It's getting lighter
There goes the allnighter

",The All Nighter
Glenn Frey,"Well, they look to the east, they look to the west 
The third world wonders, which way's the best 
We got freedom, we got soul 
We got blue jeans and Rock 'n' Roll 

Man there ain't no choice 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better in the U.S.A.) 
You can be what you want 
Say what you want to say (It's better in the U.S.A.) 

How can I make you understand 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better in the U.S.A.) 
I hear the same propaganda, day after day 
It's gettin' so hip, to knock the U.S.A 

If we're so lawful, and we're so bad 
You oughta check the nightlife in Leningrad 
Man it ain't even close 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better in the U.S.A.) 

If you could see behind the curtain 
Life is cold and gray (It's better in the U.S.A.) 
How can I make you understand 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better, it's better) 

Nobody's perfect and change comes slow 
It's really up to you which way you want to go 
You can move to the left or move to the right 
You can stand in the dark, you can stand in the light 

Drivin' on the beach on a night in June 
Me and me baby and the lover's moon 
We're playin' sweet soul music, got it turned up loud 
Makes me feel so good, makes me feel so proud 

Man there ain't no choice 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better in the U.S.A.) 
They'd be movin' here from Moscow 
If they could only find a way (It's better in the U.S.A.) 

How can I make you understand 
It's better in the U.S.A. (It's better) 
We got burgers and fries (In the U.S.A.) 
We got the friendly skies (In the U.S.A.) 

We got the beautiful girls (In the U.S.A.) 
They got the beautiful curls (In the U.S.A.) 
We're drivin' beautiful cars (In the U.S.A.) 
We're diggin' movie stars (In the U.S.A.) 

We get to make romance (In the U.S.A.) 
We let the little girls dance (In the U.S.A.)

Glenn Frey,"Woke up this morning with a smile on my face 
Set up in bed, and looked around this old place 
Opened the window, let the sun shine in 
You see, me and my baby, we're back together again. 

Jumped on the freeway with this song in my head 
I started thinkin' 'bout the things we said 
I said I'm sorry; She said I'm sorry too; 
You know I can't be happy 'less I'm happy with you. 

I got love, it's my lucky day 
I got love, gonna keep it that way 
It's the sweetest gift from the heavens above 
I got you, babe, I got love. 

No more staring at my blue telephone 
No more pretending I like being alone 
No more searching when the workday's done 
I get back on the freeway, head on home to number one 

I got love, she's waiting for me 
I got love, she's sweet as can be 
She's the greatest gift from the heavens above 
OO, babe, I got love 

When you've got love, you got to walk like a man 
You've got to bend, you've got to understand 
It won't be easy, no, no, that's not in the plan, 
But if it ain't all honey, still it's right on the money 

I got love, I'm happy to say 
I got love, it's stronger each day 
It's the sweetest gift from the powers above 
I got you, babe, and I know I got love 

I got love 
I got love",I Got Love
Glenn Frey,"I've been all over town 
Lookin' all around 
Now I finally see you 
At a table with friends 
Where ev'ry one pretends 
I'm not try'n' to free you 
I know I let you down 
But now I've found 
I can't live alone 
I just have one thing to say, baby 
Let's go home 
Hurry finish up your drink 
We've had lots of time to think 
Let's just steel away 
Please just come with me 
I need some privacy 
For what I've got to say 
You know the way I feel 
And now I realize 
I should have known 
There's no living without you 
So let's go home 
Let's go home 
For once in my life, I finally see 
You mean everything, in the world to me 
I'm willing to take all the bad with the good 
I'm ready to do everything that I should 
Since we've been apart 
I've had a change of heart 
Yes, I changed my mind 
I'm tryin' to say it right 
I need you here tonight 
Baby, I ain't lyin' 
So please look in my eyes 
If you still love me, 
You will know 
It's just you with me, baby

Glenn Frey,"There's a lover's moon tonight
As I look back over my shoulder
All the stars are shining bright
Just like the nights when I used to hold her
She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon

Lover's moon, won't you shine on me?
I'm dancing with a memory
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have one last chance to hold her tight

Waiting, I know she's waiting
I know she waits for me under the lover's moon

There's a lover's moon tonight
Shining down on half of this world
So many souls are in its light
But for me there is just one girl

And she's waiting, I know she's waiting
I know she waits for me under the lover's moon
Under the lover's moon

Glenn Frey,"New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
And it's so right, and it's so fine 
It's new love and it's mine, all mine 
I've been walking down the same old street 
Going nowhere, shuffling my feet 
The lonely nights never seemed to end 
There was just no reason to start again 
But now, new love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
And all I want, yes indeed 
It's new love and it's all I need 
She said ""You need me, and I need you"" 
And she knows how it feels, 'cause she's been there too 
She took my hand and the pain was gone 
She gave me hope and a brand new song 
New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just some tears I cried 
New love is walking by my side 
New love is calling me 
Old love has set me free 
Old love is just a memory

Glenn Frey,"Girl, I brought you a little present to celebrate tonight 
And let you know everything's gonna be alright 
In spite of all the love I'm feeling 
I know there's something you're concealing 
I was hoping you would ease my worried mind 
If there's somebody else, you should let me know 
If there's somebody else, better let him go 
If there's somebody else, you can set him free 
Tell that somebody else, you belong to me 
You belong to me 
(spoken) Listen! 
I know ev'ry secret you've been keeping 
Who you're going with and where you're sleeping 
And I'm telling you, you got to stop it now 
Hope you're listening to what I'm saying 
This is not a silly game we're playing; 
It's the one and only thing I can't allow 
If there's somebody else, you should set him free 
If there's somebody else, then it's history 
If he knew how it was, then he'd let you go 
If there's somebody else, you should let him know 
How could you think that I would not see? 
It shows that you got no respect for me 
If there's somebody else, you got one more chance 
If there's somebody else, it's a dead romance 
I don't really want to say goodbye 
Oh, it would break my heart, if I should see you cry 
You know you can't go on denying who I am 
And darlin' that is why there can be no other man 
If there's somebody else, then let me know 
If there's somebody else, you better let him go 
If there's somebody else, you can set him free 
Tell that somebody else, you belong to me 
If there's somebody else

If there's somebody else

I think I understand what you had to say
Message came through loud and clear
You've got to get away from me and away from here
I tell myself I'm over you, then I'm just a liar
Cause every time I think of you it fills me with desire
Love is like a burning flame, keeps on getting higher
And I, I can't put out this fire,
Can't put out this fire

Well I don't know what went wrong with you and me
Sometimes you get so close you just can't see
Now I'm out here standin' in the rain
Thinkin' 'bout us and livin' with the pain
If I could only talk to you, then you'd understand
If I could hold you close to me you'd know I'm still your man
Love is like a burning flame, keeps on getting higher
And I, I can't put out this fire,
Can't put out this fire

You know breaking up is harder than it sounds
People leave, but love still hangs around
The memories refuse to go away
They follow you and haunt you, night and day
Love like ours will never die, can't put out this fire
Cause when I think of you and I, it fills me with desire
Love is like a burning flame, keeps on getting higher
And I, I can't put out this fire,
Can't put out this fire
Can't put out this fire.",Can't Put Out This Fire
Glenn Frey,"Another lonely night under the spell of the summer moon
I heard the wind sing a lonely tune
I did it for your love

I waited by the shore
Just for a glimpse of you, nothing more
I heard the wind tell the stars above
I did it for your love

How can I believe in love when all that I can see
Is everything it's done to you and me?
I went the extra mile
Did everything just to see you smile
Somehow I knew it was all worth while
Cause I did it for your love

The leaves will soon be turning, then falling to the ground
I'll face the cold of winter, but you won't be around
Another lonely night, somehow, it all slipped through my hands
Somehow, I knew you would understand

Do what you got to do.

And sometimes dreams come true.
I just want to say,
I believe in you.

If you leave too soon,
Or if you stay too long.
If it's meant to be,
Only time will tell.
If you have to leave,
Then I'll say farewell.

On and on, the way lovers do 
Looking back, I see them talking 
So many things remind me of you 

I always thought we'd be together 
I never dreamed we'd drift apart 
Here I am, driving home to no one 
To spend the night with my broken heart 

I'm some kind of blue without you 
Don't know what to do about you 
From the minute you said we were through 
I've been some kind of blue 

I lay in bed, and stare at the ceiling 
I think of you walking out the door 
I can't describe the sadness I'm feeling 
I guess your love don't live here no more 

I'm some kind of blue without you 
Don't know what to do about you 
It's out of my hands, you made other plans 
But, I'm still in love with you

You've been out riding fences, for so long now
Oh you're a hard one but I know you got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, she'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't getting no younger

Your pain and your hunger they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time, from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences and open the gate?
It may be raining, oh raining but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you before it's too late

Someone's drinking cold champagne 
In another part of town 

And the only thing he thinks about 
As he sips his glass of wine 
It sure feels good sitting here tonight

I've got mine, I've got mine 
This isn't such a bitter world 
'Cause I've got mine 
Someone's wandering the streets tonight 

No way to warm his hands 
Someone's turning up their fireplace 
Making travel plans 
His mind is on some sandy beach 

Where the sun is gonna shine 
He thinks ""I don't have to hang around 
Now that I've got mine""

You see the way they stare 
They don't see us looking back 
Because they don't really care (they say)

The world is as it's meant to be 
'Cause I've got mine

You know I didn't make this world 
I'm in it just like you 
I've worked all my life on this house of cards 
To keep it all in line 

I can't take care of everyone 
Now that I've got mine 
There's another kind of poverty 
That only rich men know 

A moral malnutrition 
That starves their very souls 
And they can't be saved with money 
They're all running out of time 

And all the while they're thinking 
""It's ok 'Cause I've got mine"" 
I've got mine, I've got mine 
I don't want a thing to change 
'Cause I've got mine, I've got mine",I've Got Mine
Glenn Frey,"Look at all the people lined up outside, 
This must be the place 
I see beautiful women dressed in black, 
Everyone a pretty face 

Red lips, tight hips, hey little girl 
You make my heart do flips 
Baby please, don't tease, can't you see 
I love you I'm on my knees 

Something is wrong with this picture 
She doesn't like the way I dance 
Why is everybody just standin' around 
Lookin' for true romance 

I'm looking at you and what do I see 
Love in the 21st Century 
I know what you're thinking 
What's in it for me? 

That's love in the 21st Century, 
Love in the 21st Century 
Tell me do I look like a desperate man 
Champagne and flowers in my hand 

I don't know her, she don't know me 
She's my video date, she's my destiny 
Do you like to party? (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
Do you want to settle down? (no, no, no) 

Do you like my kind of music? (yeh, yeh, yeh) 
Do you want to mess around? (whoa, whoa, whoa) 
Something is wrong with this picture 
She doesn't even look the same 

Whatever a poor boy does these days 
Love is still a losing game 
I'm looking at you, you're looking at me 
It's love in the 21st Century 

We're living in pictures, we want what we see 
That's love in the 21st Century 
Where do you go? What do you do? 
How can somebody make his dreams come true? 

What does everybody need desperately? 
Love in the 21st Century, love in the 21st Century 
She wants to party, love on the line 
She likes to party, love on the line 

It's the same sad story all over this world 
Every man looking for the perfect girl 
He sees her everyday in a magazine 
Sees her everynight on a T.V. screen 

Something is wrong with this picture 
Has everybody gone insane? 
Whatever a poor boy does these days 
You can't find love and it's a cryin' shame 

I can't touch you and you can't touch me 
It's love in the 21st Century 
It's all imagination and fantasy 
That's love in the 21st Century 

You can get it by mail, you can get it by phone 
You can get it late at night when you're all alone 
What does everybody want desperately? 
Love in the 21st Century 

We need love in the 21st Century",Love in the 21st Century

Great expectations, ev'rybody's watching you.
People you meet, they all seem to know you.

Ev'rybody loves you, so don't let them down.

Hopeless romantics, here we go again.
But after a while you're looking the other way.

There's so many things you should have told her,

There's talk on the street; it's there to remind you 
that it doesn't really matter which side you're on.
You're walking away and they're talking behind you.
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along.
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town.
Ev'rybody loves him, don't they?
Now he's holding her, and you're still around. Oh, my, my.
There's a new kid in town, just another new kid in town.
Ooh, hoo.  Ev'rybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town.

Against your skin, it's so brown

'Cause I'm already standing on the

Ah, but she can't take you anyway

And I gotta peaceful, easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down

Glenn Frey,"On a dark December morning 
When the sun refused to shine 
Spent another sleepless night 
Got so much on my mind 
Think I finally know what's wrong 
I think I've gotta leave this place behind 
So I said ""wake up, Linda, 
I've had a dream 
I dreamed we moved away from here 
To a place I'd never seen 
Where the nights were long and cold 
And the air was fresh and clean."" 
And there we were standing 
Underneath the western sky 
Beside a home we built ourselves 
Way up in the mountains high 
And we lived happy there, just you and I 
On a river of dreams 
There's no need to worry now 
'Cause I've got a plan 
We don't need this modern world 
I'm not a modern man 
We're gonna get ourselves off these city streets 
We're gonna get back on the land 
There's a whole lot of people out there 
Feel just like you and me 
They'd love to pack their leavin' trucks 
And say goodbye to all their misery 
What'd ya say we pack up that Camaro, honey 
And chase the sun until we're free 
And if I could I'd lift you up on angel wings 
We'd fly away and never worry about a thing 
We'd know the joy and riches a simple life can bring 
On a river of dreams, on a river of dreams 
So get your things together now 
I'll be getting mine 
I've finally got the feeling girl 
The sun is gonna shine 
You know people don't run out of dreams 
People just run out of time 
Let's find that place out there 
Underneath the western sky 
We'll build a home ourselves 
Way up in the mountains high 
We'll live happy there 'til the day we die 
On a river of dreams 
And we'll have stars to wish on every single night 
We'll build a fire and make love by candlelight 
We'll do our moondance 'til we get it right 
On a river of dreams, on a river of dreams 
I can see us standing by the river 
Holding hands beside the river",River of Dreams

You came along and you changed my life
You got me feeling things, I swear I never felt before
You looked at me, that's all it took
You read my heart like an open book

Well, it was true love- right from the start
True love, straight from my heart
True love, ain't no doubt about it, baby
True love, now I can't live without it

Before I met you baby, I was alone
Thought I was happy livin' on my own
But now I realize this world was made for two, like me and you
With you by my side, everything's fine
There ain't no mountain, sugar, we can't climb

We got a true love, that's all we need
True love, it's got a lifetime guarantee
True love, so hard to find
True love, put your heart on the line now
True love, makes every day a little brighter
True love, makes every burden just a little lighter
True love, it'll make you be a better man
If you had true love, you'd understand

You came along and you changed my life

You lift me up, you make me strong
You give me lovin' lastin' all night long

And the trees are sweetly bloomin'
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the bloomin' heather

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go lassie go?


I will build my love a bower
By a cool crystal fountain
And around it I will pile
All the wild flowers from the mountain
Will ye go lassie go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather
Will ye go lassie go?


If my true love should not come
Then I'll surely find another
To pull wild mountain mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather

The ground below was shaking, with the risin' wind
I looked over my shoulder, said goodbye to my home
After today there'd be no turning back, we were on our own
Everyone had taken sides, the battle lines were drawn
We stared into the face of war, and waited for the dawn
Everything that we worked for, they took from our hands
We were left with no choice but to stand up and fight for this land
But don't worry darlin', this will all be over soon
Just remember you will always be my girl,
And somehow you will find the strength
To stand up on your own
And live in this brave new world
How it all came down to this, no one can really say
Every time we cried out for help, they looked the other way
Now there's no turning back, we have got to be strong
We will travel the hard road to freedom, no matter how long

On a cold and windy night
With the water ragin' higher
By the moon's shinin' light
Suddenly a man stepped forward
And he looked at all around
He said, ""We all must cross this river
We all stand on common ground""
Though I was standin' amongst strangers
I did not know their names
I realized they were with me
And our journey was the same
As he spoke out loud, I looked around me
I could see they knew it, too
We would cross or die together
No one man could make it through
There was shelter across the river
Across the water deep and black
As a storm moved in behind us,
There was no way to turn back
So I stepped right up beside him
And took one last look around
That before my eyes I realized,
We all stand on common ground
We all stand on common ground
So many years have come and gone
Since we crossed that river wide
When I look back on that night
It still moves me so inside
This world today is like that river
Its water cold and black
We all must cross together,
For there is no turnin' back
For the mountain high or a city street,
It's the same old world below our feet
It's time to wake up, people, and take a look around
We all stand on common ground
It's time for every woman and every man
And hold the future in our hands

Headed nowhere, was just drivin' by myself
The night was cold, the wind was blowin'
Me, I felt like I was someone else
I was achin', I was alone
No destination, so far away from home
Suddenly I find myself callin' to the heavens above,
""Please send me someone to love""
Which way to happiness? Over the mountain
Which way to freedom? Just across the sea
Lord, I been searchin' for what seems like forever, now
Which way to happiness for someone like me?
It seems like I spend my whole life runnin'
Runnin' away from what I couldn't be
Down some endless road just south of nowhere
Always movin' but never really free
I had a dream, I said a prayer
Just like the answer, you were standin' there
The neon sign that was fifteen stories tall
I could hear the angels call
This way to happiness, the train is leavin'
Over the mountain, headin' to sea
Highway to freedom is when you start believin'
This way to happiness, you and me

It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline why

Could I ever find in you again
Things that made me love you so much then
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone

Glenn Frey,"I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you're in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons

Glenn Frey,"No complaints and no regrets
I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
And I have learned that all you give is all you get
So give it all you've got

I had my share, I drank my fill
And even though I'm satisfied, I'm hungry still
To see what's down another road, beyond a hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Funny how the time just flies
How love can go from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories you've memorized
To keep your winters warm

But there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings, or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game, I want to play
For laughs, for life, for love

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
Here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
And here's to you

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better

Just worrying over you
I'm getting old and it's a crime
To treat me the way you do

I'm getting old before my time
I need a crutch and a cane
Overs had some rings for a dime
Buy one and I won't complain

We planned to get married
About ten years ago
You stalled and you tarried
You wouldn't say “yes” and you wouldn't say “no”

I'm getting old before my time
Someday I'll feel like new
That's when we'll hear the preacher speak
And I'll belong to you

Is in your eyes
A look your heart can't disguise

And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

The look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go

Glenn Frey,"One day we walked along the sand
One day in early Spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend its' broken wing

Now I remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Glenn Frey,"Oh, the good life, full of fun seems to be the ideal
Mm, the good life lets you hide all the sadness you feel
You won't really fall in love for you can't take the chance
So please be honest with yourself, don't try to fake romance

It's the good life to be free to explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn you must face them alone
Please remember I still want you, and in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up, kiss the good life goodbye",The Good Life [*]
Glenn Frey,"I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

Somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company
Wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around [*]
Glenn Frey,"You promised me love that would never die
That promise you made was only a lie
Now after you've gone all alone
I pine for all that I've got is a worried mind

And when I was down you just left me there
I needed you so but you didn't care
You've found a new love and a home so fine
But all that I've got is a worried mind",Worried Mind [*]
Glenn Frey,"Somewhere along the way I found the meaning
Woke up dreaming along the way
Never quite seems the same when you awaken
And makin' up for the time is such a price to pay
Then they take your dream away and it just ain't fair

Help me through the night, mama
Help me ease the pain
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

That's the danger in pretending
Trying to defend yourself from someone else's war
Don't know what they're fighting for
And they just don't care

So help me to see the light, mama
Open my eyes again
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

Would you help me?
Could you help me?

Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be somethin' better
But there's nowhere else in sight

When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay
In the city, oh, oh.
In the city 

I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall

Faraway from the neon sky
I know there must be somethin' better

And I can't stay another night

Drink a few beers

Bowl a few frames

Pick up the dog do

Hope that it's hard (whaf whaf)

You face a crime that we'll hear about
To pay the cost, would never be the same

Eternal lovers, we're not to blame
There's no mistake, there's no refrain
The same surroundings that stood
Are here again - this time around

As I look around you can't be found
To lose you, I'd rather see the endless
Time and space go passing by

This time around

Glenn Hughes,"Let me breathe, my tired body
Let me sleep inside my bed
Don't let me fall into the darkness
While you weave your tangled web
Don't leave me slain beside the gutter
Show me my flesh, then lock me in,
Then wash me down in holy water
Then close my eyes, until I'm gone

Throw my soul into the fire
Let my body burn in sin
It's so cold and I'm no liar
And it's all the same, all the same
It's just addiction

You can't deny the pain you're under
You know the wheel refuse to turn
Can't break that spell and you have 2 wonder
Can't walk away, you never learn
Don't live that lie, 'cause you can take it
You must have been some kind of man
I feel the rage of your condition
'cause you will find euphoria

Can you taste your last temptation?
Your state of mind is filled with shame
If you fail to shake your demon
Tormented life, no one to blame",Addiction
Glenn Hughes,"She wears a blood red rose
Her face she never shows
through the doorway, to the window
In the light
A vision in a dream
And I don't know what it means
Is it my imagination or is it you?

Blue Jade comes to my room
She won't go
Gold shade covers the moon
And I don't know, about Blue Jade

Is it fate or destiny?
Only she does hold the key
Fallen angel, I am driven to your side
From the moment you are here
I'm a man without a fear
You're the reason, my religion, you're my guide

And when she comes to me
Lord I never want to be
Broken-hearted, disillusioned by her smile
And I know it just can't be
When I hear your symphony
Am I sleeping, is this really in my mind?
I can feel and I can see
Everytime she comes to me
I just can't believe that you're my life",Blue Jade
Glenn Hughes,"Somewhere between the lines unbroken
There lies the sacred part of me
Behind the door that once was opened
Is where I fell from grace you see

Inside I feel the pressure
My faith I cannot measure
Seems like the wound has deepened
I wake but I'm not breathing
And I say

Cover me, while I'm sleeping, won't you cover me
Cover me, if I'm bleeding, won't you cover me
Cover me, be my shadow, won't you cover me
Cover me, I will follow, won't you cover me

So won't you take this captured spirit
Now won't you hear my final plea
You got to cut the wire
Release your sympathy
Unspoken words that heal
This dream just can't be real
And I say

Somewhere between the lines unbroken
There lies the sacred part of me",Cover Me
Glenn Hughes,"Down
Well I'm feelin' like you took me in
And wrapped your cursed magic over me
If you vow to never cross my path
I'll give you back the shame
So you could see - I'd rather be dead

Deep down inside your dream
The evil that you make
You put my life on trial
It's a chance I have to take
Too late the rhapsody
That plays inside my head
It's dark before the dawn
My eyes are burnin' red

I've been down is where you left me
I've been down, I do not belong
I've been down, won't somebody help me?
I've been down, I did you no wrong

In your world that's hid by tinted glass
You lie behind the fragments of yourself
In an empty room, you hide behind the
Smile that pulls me back again, time again

The pistol's in my hand
I have to let you know
I put you in the ground
Now I have to let you go

Has put a grip on me

Glenn Hughes,"I kiss the day, there can be no other answer
Turn back the time and let me in
I look away, as they stare and all their glances
Now I can tell you where I've been
All alone inside myself
I guess I never knew which way to go
The time has come to know yourself
And I don't want to live that way again
Again, again, again

I'm miles away, as I look into the water
And there's a tide that pulls me in
The missing page where there'll be the sons and daughters
I live and die it's hard to take
Safe within, this higher ground
The pleasure and the pain has come and gone
I have been once lost now found
And I don't want to live that way again

There's a light in the distance
And a voice that cries freedom
There's a child in the mirror,
Much too long he's been grievin'
I have stumbled through madness
Now I've made my decision
And I don't want to live that way again

So I pull down the shutters
And I wave my resistance
And I wait for the sirens
That will ring through my head
I was cast as a leper
Now I've replaced my religion
And I don't want to live that way again",I Don't Want to Live That Way Again
Glenn Hughes,"Why have you been so complicated
You took a hold on me
I've never been so aggravated
Won't you listen carefully

You paint a tragedy, confess yourself to me
And I will take it to my grave
Your last mistake you see, you're
Damned and now I'm free
Because I'm not your slave

Why do you push me into the shadows
Why do you bear no shame
How can you tell me that nothin' else matters
When you, don't even know my name

I'm not your slave",I'm Not Your Slave
Glenn Hughes,"JUSTIFIED MAN
Down by the beggar's wall
There is another land
This is the place. I come to set me free
Just like a fighting man lost in a river
I didn't notice I was blind but now I see
They took a photograph
They heard my story
And then the jury tried and sentenced me
And now I'm sanctified, without resistance
I left my body. And I'm gonna let it be
Now I'm standin' on the platform
At the station
I hear the engine of the train
That takes me there
I ain't lookin' back,
Until I reach my destination
Nobody gonna bring me down
I'm a justified man
Inside the hour glass,
The sand keeps turnin'
Outside my window, falls the rain
That washes me
Gone is my fear, need no assistance
And now I'm justified,
Those days are gone you see
I've been livin' in war of speculation
I stand accused but I ain't goin' anywhere
I ain't lookin' back
Until I reach my destination

Born in the city, you are Mother Nature's friend
You come one step closer to yourself -
Over by the looking glass you worship no one else
I go one step back inside my shell
Sitting in your country house
You work them to the bone
So they tell me who's been there
There's no doubt about it, you've been Heaven
Tailor Made
And they talk about you everywhere

You made your choice
You have the world in the palm of your hands

You live the life of luxury, you have to pay no rent
You come one step further, what is your role?
You're headin' for that deadline baby,
Now tell me what you find?
I go one step deeper inside the cold
You live your life in misery,
How can you be so cruel
You go one step nearer to the wall
I know this is a tragedy now tell me who's your fool?
You come one step closer to the fall

In the coldness of love’s sweet illusion
There’s a sadness that stands in my way
There’s a note that I left in the hallway

Now I’ve got nothin’ to say

I don’t want to talk about it
I don’t even hear a word you say
I don’t want to talk about it

And you won't be the last 'cause I?ll be strong

How come I did let you in? How come?

And you won't be the last, I?ll be strong

Now listen to me, brother
Can you hear my voice out in the rain
You think about no other
I can see your life is filled with pain
I see you on the pages 
Of the weekly Hollywood Gazette
But still your soul it rages
How can you judge my life when you haven't lived yet?",Out on Me
Glenn Hughes,"Cold, but still you keep ridin'
Try to find a higher place
Gold and Silver are your passion
Hide behind your painted face

When you fall
Say goodbye to the future
When you fall
You let your karma burn

When you fall
A freak of mother nature
You never learn
Eyes that killed me with persuasion

Throw away the evil seed
Now your life is filled with tension
Lies, you're lost inside your greed
I won't be there in your corner

'Cause the truth of the matter is
I couldn't stay
I want to be the one
To let you down slowly

'Cause you scare me to death
And you don't have a good thing to say",When You Fall
Glenn Hughes,"Say you love me, but you don't care
Put on your makeup and you fix your hair
You're steppin' out
You're hitting the town
And you made it clear
You don't want me around
I gave you everything a man possibly could
You say walk through fire baby, I would
I'd move a mountain, my love is so strong
But I get the feeling that it won't be long
I don't want to hear you say goodbye
You just gotta give me one more try
Tell me why
You want to watch me fall
You want to see me crawl
You say you want it all
Baby you got me, you got me against the wall
I can't eat, I can't sleep at night
Push and pull, but I can't win the fight
Got this feeling I should let you go
My head says yes but my heart tells me no
You got all my money you got all my time
Take my soul, now I'm losing my mind
What can I do baby, what can I say
'cause I'd do anything to make you stay
I don't know why you want to say goodbye
You just gotta give me one more try
Tell me why",Against the Wall
Glenn Hughes,"When the sky was burnin' red
When the mountains crumble and fall
And I was outta my head
That's when I heard you call

I can feel a change in the weather
I put my feet on the ground
I had to pull myself together
I'm gonna tell you what I found

Better man - I know
I'm a better man
Better than before
Won't you let me go

And let the river flow
When the sea did cover the land
And you did not believe in fate
Came to me and gave me your hand

Only a fool would hesitate
Now you can tell me brother
'Cause I've been away too long
There's one way or another

'Cause I never felt so strong
So walk with me my friend
'Cause I want you to see
And I cannot pretend
'Cause I just gotta be...",Better Man
Glenn Hughes,"I got my posi-traction
I'm hell on wheels
I'm made of iron blood and steel
I'm always set for action

I'm shifting gears
I'm running faster than my fears
Leaving everything behind me
I'm on a race with destiny

I'm going where my dreams can find me
Someplace where I can be free
I can see heaven, it's a long way to go
But I'm riding the devil's road

I can hear angels singing lifting my soul
And I'm riding the devil's road
I got my higher power
He come to me on the seventh hour

Never burn my ivory tower
Now I have been set free",Devil's Road
Glenn Hughes,"I'll be there when the darkness falls
Everywhere when the shadows call
Hear the wind how it cries your name
Don't you worry there's no one to blame
Why, oh why can't I be free
Only emptiness inside of me
'cause in my heart
I know you'd never stay
Tell me how long does it take
For love to fade away
I let you slip right through my hands
Now I try for a second chance
I never wanted to let you go
Now there's one thing you should know
Why, oh why can't I be free
Only emptiness inside of me
'cause in my heart
I knew you'd never stay
Tell me how long does it take
For love to fade away",Fade Away
Glenn Hughes,"I know there's a place I see
Your spirit keeps haunting me
And I never worry, 'cause I do believe
You will find me here
I'm floating through space and time
Your love is all over the line
Why can it be when all hope is gone?
Then you turned around
There without a sound
Baby, heaven's missing an angel
Did you fall from a star like an angel from above
Your moonbeam smile and the warmth of love
Heaven's missing an angel
So much more than a woman to me
Finally love came to set my heart free
I'm high on a silver cloud
I see your face in the crowd
And I know that it's only a matter of time
Your love will come to me
Your love will come to me
Who am I to regret the past
I live and die and I want it to last
But if I was to leave I want you to know
I'll be by your side, 'cause you're my soul and pride",Heaven's Missing an Angel
Glenn Hughes,"I'm on the train all dressed in black
And you know I'm coming back for you
Back for you

I go from town to town
I know just what I'm gonna do
And I'm not asking you
Something I won't regret
And I don't need no sympathy
Cause all I want to do, I hope I won't forget

I can read between the lines
Name, missed your name it's a shame
I must of missed your name it's a shame
I'm to blame, I must of missed your name

I need a little sanity
Or are you just a vision in my head
I want some identity
So we can spill the wine
And taste the bread

And don't want to live
And face another day
I just want you by my side
Now tell me, won't you give me
Something you can't hide
I can read between the lines",Missed Your Name
Glenn Hughes,"The time has come again
Throw a kiss and lose a friend
Some things are just better left in the past
Tomorrow never knows

Passes by, comes and goes
Can you tell me how long will love last?
I'll remember you and me
And how it felt inside

I guess it wasn't meant to be
But it's so hard to say goodbye
Why do the winds of change carry us away?
They leave us lost and torn apart

What are we searching for, never sure
Wanting more?
Maybe that's the mystery of the heart
Love is rare and life is strange

Nothing lasts and people change
Memories that time just can't erase
Wish I could go back, I know
How I want to hold you so

I'd give anything to see your face
Lonely dreams of yesterday
Like footprints in the sand
Wish that I could find a way
But I'll never understand",Mystery of the Heart
Glenn Hughes,"Stare out my window until the light fades
The darkness overcomes me
Someone is lost, someone is saved
I wonder which one will I be
Searching for something
Just what I'm not sure
Some way to change my life
One thing's for certain
Can't take this anymore
I feel like I'm losing the fight
How long have I lived this way
Alone in the atmosphere
I see you but I'm 10,000 miles a way 
Gotta turn it around...I'll be walking tall
I'm gonna try and keep my head
It's along way down...so far to fall
When you're standing on the ledge
A burning heart full of broken dreams
Trapped inside my frozen soul
A desperate man goes to extremes
Before he loses control
Lost my faith in heaven, and my fear of hell
There's no place that I belong
Don't want your pity, save that for yourself
I know what it takes to be strong",On the Ledge
Glenn Hughes,"A world of trouble, betrayl and deceit
Hiding in the shadows, there's terror in the streets
It came without warning, no one heard the call
Dark clouds are falling, the black rain will fall

Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm
The distant fire, burning on the shore
Oh the cities crumble, I hear the gods of war

Screaming for vengeance, there's no hope in sight
Lighting and thunder, striking the night
Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm

I know, burn in the conscience of every man
You don't have to push me, 'cause I'll make a stand
Won't you let me breathe?
When I go, I give back the freedom to every child

Give me the wisdom, the sadness, the sorrow
But leave me tomorrow
I feel the sunshine on me
Ride, ride the storm
Ride, ride the storm",Ride the Storm
Glenn Hughes,"Night after night, you're out on the street
Just like a stray cat on the prowl
Down in the neon, the hustle and the heat
You got a need to fill somehow

Do you wannabe free, tell me how do you see
You're outta sight, outta mind
Do you feel the same, or are you hiding your pain
You're dying to feel so alive

Are you living it up, sister midnight
Taking your chances, checking off your list
You always say your life is justified
Never stop looking, to see what you missed

Trying to fill that empty hole inside
Do you want to be free, tell me how do you see
You're outta touch, outta time
Now I know your name, are you lost in your shame

Don't you know you are living a lie
Are you living it up, sister midnight
Oh, I'm waiting for the heartache
Oh, I'm waiting for the day

That you finally see
See what you're doing to me
Are you living it up
Are you giving it up
Have you had enough, sister midnight",Sister Midnight
Glenn Hughes,"Kicked to the gutter, pushed to the side
Feels like were hanging by the fringe
Burned down and battered
Fight to stay alive
Out in the cold and left for dead

So tired of being pushed around
We'll love forever

Glenn Hughes,"I see you have a mystical connection
I hear your voice, it's haunting me
You know the body is weak, where do I belong
You never left a '68 daydream
I hear they made your movie in June
Now all the kids goin' downtown
Are singing your song

There comes a time to learn and digest it
I sacrifice all my patience
To be like you

I can see that you're justified
And I get your point of view

You're courageous
You are strong
You're courageous
All along
Turn the pages
Brand new dawn
You're courageous
Your time has come

You do believe in lovin' your brother
I can see you found a new way

It's all because you live day to day
And you receive the colours that love will bring",Courageous
Glenn Hughes,"You're the black sheep of the family
And what you do is killing me
And I don't want to hang with you
Now I want you to see

You know you're living with a one-track mind
I'm warning you I'm not that kind
You're just a memory
Now I'm leaving you behind

Tell me, tell another lie to me
Tell me I will set you free
Won't you let me be
'Cause you burn me with your gasoline

I've been trying to turn my back
You know you give me a heart attack
I don't need no microphone

Mama's little baby, was going out to sea
You know he couldn't sail, so he slipped into a dream
I can see you ridin' on the crest of the storm
So come inside with me, 'cause I will keep you warm

Higher places, distant faces
Can't you see they want to live again
Higher places, soul traces
Can't you see they want to live again

I can feel the sun shine,
And I want you to know
So many times I was alone, and there was no hope
So wash your hands in the water
Until you find your way
I keep on telling you
So maybe you won't stray
It's no use getting jaded,
The living wheel goes round
I was once frustrated,
And I finally hit the ground
I'll be glad to meet you, I won't let you fall
'Cause I was always there for you, I hope you do recall

And I want you to see, just how it's gonna be

Rushing to my brain
Welcome to the frontier
And I am so glad you came

Beautiful the sinner
Led me to believe

You know I should

Paralyzed with fear

You thought I could not hear

And I hope you're gonna come around

So let's go find tranquility

Glenn Hughes,"You went down to ol' Mexico
I said you should not go there alone
29 in the midday sun
I'm not the only one
I should have known
That's when I heard a voice say to me

And the wind gently whispers
And the sky begin to crack
I've been far and wide
Now you throw me aside
It's just a lie

[Chorus]
This was your last mistake
This was your only break
This was your last mistake
Now it's over, it's all over

I heard you went sailin' to the Ivory Coast
It's where you make the most of your time
Soon you'll be flying on a silver bird
You know I never heard of such a crime
That's when my inner voice started talking to me

Then the mountains did crumble
And the earth moved at my feet
I've been far and wide
Now you throw me aside
It's just a lie

The devil in the wilderness put his hands around my soul
He took me down to the blood red fountain
Water tastes like wine and it tastes like wine, like wine

Then I saw myself in the broken glass
I was never gonna last, let it go
Then I heard a voice inside my head
""Soon I will be gone"", let it go

St. Peter stood beside me
And I could not let it go

For 30 days and 30 nights the sand did turn to snow
And somehow God did show his face but how was I to know
It's all in my past, in my past
It's all in my past

Then I saw myself in the broken glass
I was never gonna last, let it go

And there can be no doubt
His mind was in a haze
And he was so worn out
He lost serenity
Within a fractured life
With no apology
He knew that he was right
But his eyes they did not see
Heading for a tragedy

To prove his innocence
He'll take it to the grave
In his deliverance
Somebody could be saved

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace
He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

Inside his caravan
He pulled the shutters down
And will he ever see
What all the others found?
He stood upon the roof
Get closer to the sky
Condition critical
No time to wonder why
But his eyes they could not see
Heading for a tragedy

He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace

Glenn Hughes,"She sits alone in the hall
And soon she'll climb the stairs
To her room, she's so lonely
With sadness and despair
She can hear the static

Vast is the canvas, she painted
To justify the cause, of her life
In her childhood
She barely spoke a word
She was so dramatic

She's leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
God only knows she's been given
She's so frail

And you know she's going back

That stands upon a shelf
And the fire's last ember
It burns in silent grace, for a new tomorrow

Of opportunity
Soon she'll join all her loved ones

Without the one you love

You were always playing my records
When I was after making some love
But I need more than the music
To keep myself together
Although it makes me feel so good

You can't do it right
With the one you love
Nothing you can do
Without the one you love

Sometimes in the morning
I wake up without you
Can't get up, it's getting me down
Tell me what you're trying to do
Later in the evening
You come home feeling low
If you'd stop your cruising
Maybe we could make a show

You can't do it right
With the one you love
Nothing you can do
Without the one you love",You Can't Do It Right
Glenn Hughes,"Seems like a thousand days
And there can be no doubt
His mind was in a haze
And he was so worn out
He lost serenity
Within a fractured life
With no apology
He knew that he was right
But his eyes they did not see
Heading for a tragedy

To prove his innocence
He'll take it to the grave
In his deliverance
Somebody could be saved

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace
He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

Inside his caravan
He pulled the shutters down
And will he ever see
What all the others found?
He stood upon the roof
Get closer to the sky
Condition critical
No time to wonder why
But his eyes they could not see
Heading for a tragedy

He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

And the world he could not face
Prayin' for a state of grace
He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind

Gave his life

He was looking for a sign
He was selfish and unkind
Gave his life to the divine

He gave his life",The Divine [Video Clip] [*]

I'm past the pain
Here come the thud
You live your life against the grain

To you speak and then you choke?
How long, how long?

How long, how long?
Did you think that I was dead?
How long, how long?
When the sky was turning red
How Long? 

You sanctify yourself
With plush material things
You magnify your wealth
Here come the Bee that stings

In a life of misery
You are never justified

Clouds rolling in Lord it's getting cold
Feeling fine
Feel lost feeling blue tonight
But my only friend is Mr. Moonlight
Then I see you girl lost in your book of poems
You're in another world
I should leave you alone
My heart races on I try and hold it back

But like a runaway train I'm about to jump the tracks
Now you say you need a friend
I swear to you if that's what you need 
That's what I'll be

And that's all I need to know

We can take our time we can take it real slow
When I see it in your eyes
That's all I need to know

Now we're talking 'bout angels that have lost their wings
This melancholy world and the nature of things
But then there's only silence when your eyes meet mine

Reciting from your black book you were like some wounded bird
I tried to catch your heart as it fell between your words
You tore out one page and let it blow away
Then you disappeared into your world
It's a place I just can't stay

You say you need a friend
I swear to you if that's what you need 
That's what I'll be
But I hope this never ends

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast

It's gonna be alright
Keep your head up to the sky

Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain
The nigga that was takin over my brain
Redesignin my main frame
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches
Better murder they own people before they come up
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it

[Chorus x2]

[Z-Ro]
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'
Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve
All I want to do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it

So baby take my hand and away we go
To a place called ecstasy a place where lovers go

Hold on tight don't let love go
We'll take our time nice and slow
Hold on baby here we go

Glenn Lewis,"Look at you now, you really haven't changed
Still as beautiful as first day we met
But something's different, doesn't seem so long ago
Amazing how the years can go

When we wanted different things
You wanted a family, I was chasing my dream
I didn't know what I had back then
How could I go off through the growing pains of being a man?

I really didn't understand
I took you for granted, now it's out of my hands
Now I wish I had it to do all over again

'Cause all I do is dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
I just close my eyes, I just close my eyes and dream

Don't know what I had thought I really figured out
Looking back had no clue what it was all about
I tried to explain what I was feeling but when I couldn't get through
I would just turn around and get mad at you

Frustrated not knowing the reasons for the things I do
Couldn't see just why you and I would fall apart
Humble by drift and heart
But now I can clearly see how things ended up because of me
If this is how it's supposed to be then I'll just

Dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
I just close my eyes, I just close my eyes and dream

Looking back on yesterday how we were so deeply in love
Wishing it could be that way again
But even if it can't be, and we we're made just friends
All I have to do is dream

Dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault, we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
I just close my eyes, I just close my eyes and dream

About this girl I met her name's Yvette that you might know

She made it seem like she wanted to be with me
Playin' tricks on me tell me

Got me on my knees
Prayin' my eyes are lyin' to me
I built a whole new life around you

In an instant we were through
As our future disappears
Fallin' like tears
Are the dreams of a love we thought we shared

It's not fair, I was true to you
I finally settle down
Then you don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

And I trusted you
And this is what I get in return
You was like a brother to me
But now I is see you was just waitin' your turn

When I was out at work, y'all was doin' dirt
Stealin' my heart away
Shared everything with you, all I was goin' through
Now dark skies and tearful eyes are here to stay

It's not fair, I was true to you
I finally settle down
You don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you

Said that you'd be there

It's not fair, after all I sacrificed
For my seed said, you'd give life
With everything I am
Wanted for you to be happy

And now slowly the life of love
You breathed into my heart
Is slipping away, dying today
If only

Never thought I'd live to see
Disrespected me
How could it be
Let away so easily, yeah

Glenn Lewis,"I told her, deeper than the deepest ocean
Vast as the universe, high like any mountain top
Put your world in reverse
Ain't nothing in these words rehearsed

So maybe we can make a first
Let me begin with a simple phrase
I'm a sinner for lovin' you the way I do
Life's been peaks and valleys with winds of change
Still loving you was all the same

I never believed that love could be for me
Now I see clearly you were meant for me
And now I know the truth is to be with you
'Cause I know your love will always be there

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe make it better
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

Find out how deep this love can go
'Cause there ain't no guarantee
You leave or stay with me that anyways the right way
But surely we gon' make today, understood

If you would I'll be good
Knowing at times you couldn't stand it
Feeling taken for granted but I'm here to tell you, baby
I ain't going nowhere, I'ma be right here

Best believe, if love is all you need
Ooo, wee, baby, thick like gravy
Ups and downs, highs and lows
Where we'll stop only love knows

So maybe if you give me
Maybe just one more day
Find it in your heart to stay
And maybe we can make it
Maybe we can make it right
Or maybe if you hold on

And if you hold on
Maybe give me one more day

We can work it out if we take our time

Should be trying to find a 'cause 
Before a problem flaws 
But know that just to be with, you in a love that truly free 
That could be you and me

Deserted you, in the middle of the night
One to many times and askin' why

Where did all the promises go?
Of love you had, not like you don't hear me though
That's what she said to me
I treated it like it was talk just something momentary

How I regret it now and I don't know how
I let it get this bad but now I wish
I had the chance to tell you my baby

From my heart being so weak if only my tears could speak

Glenn Lewis,"It was in November
When while out one night with friends
That I saw her there
She was just standing there

Something in her distant stare
A faint look of despair
To her I was drawn
Asked her was anything wrong

I told her my name
Said how you do
'Bouts to say you take care
It was nice to meet you

Then she stopped me desperately
As if to say don't go, but then she said to me

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Not knowing what to say
But I could see
She was going through some things
And needed someone to be
There to listen, probably wishing
She was someone else

And in my heart felt bad
And I just knew I had
'Cause I'd want the same myself
So we got into it
And while she talked I thought to myself
How could it be

That she'd have no one, not even a friend to come
And she'd have to turn to me and say

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Seeking the wrong kind of attention
Always in abusive situations
And don't know how she got it good
Was starting to sound like it could be
The reason for misery

Slowly I could see
She had problems nothing
I or anyone could say or do
Would help what she was going through

Then suddenly, she stood up across from me
And as loud as she could be, screaming out
""Some one help me please""
Realizing she was gone wishing I'd mind my own saying

Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here

One day I'm around, the next I disappear 
This is a crazy act 
But I won't think I'm kissing you till that's a fact 
Cause always, ever after and more 

[Chorus] 
When you think the party's over 
Look over your shoulder 
I'm at your door, coming back for more 
Dancing in the moonlight 
Till the break of daylight 
Like we did before 
Well be coming back for more 

Were on a one-way ride 
And all I need is someone like you by my side 
You saw the movie too 
Well ride into the sunset like they always do 
For all days, all nights 
Ill hurt some more 

[Chorus] 

Well be coming back for more 
If I'm still number one 
The one you're looking for 
I won't be gone for long 
No, Ill be back for more 

[Chorus: Repeats]",Back for More [Album Version]
Glenn Lewis,"Girl I can't fight no more,
I'm not being complete
What's the word of love,
Not when meet, nothing need
Gotta get it back somehow,
I'm guessing expiration date
Is come and gone, on us baby, yeah

No matter who I'm with, what's so crazy is
Having out of love, couldn't say it since
I haven't said I love you to nobody
I'll be happy when I'll can say it once again
Give to you my heart, put it in your hand
Until then I'll be quiet, oho
See I can't tell someone something
I don't feel to open up
It's got to be real

I can't say love, not without you
No, not that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deeply, but no, not love
No, not without you
I can't say love, no not without you
Can't say that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deep, but no, not love
Love's only for you girl

How we ended up apart, I try to make sense of it then I stop
Because of you I know it feels like impossible for me to find that twice
Compared to you baby, you're the flyest young lady alive
See I always be missing your vibe
Girl I'm tired of living a lie

No matter who I'm with, what's so crazy is
Have been out of love, couldn't say it since
I haven't said I love you to nobody
I'll be happy when I'll can say it once again
Give to you my heart, put it in your hand
Until then I'll be quiet, oho
See I can't tell someone something
I don't feel to open up
It's got to be real

I can't say love, not without you
No, not that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deeply, but no, not love
No, not without you
I can't say love, no not without you
Can't say that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deeply, but no, not love
Love's only for you girl

I can never tell a girl, that that's love when I know it's not
I can see her probably care for a few, but with you I can't live without
I need you, like my air girl, something I would never lie
See the way I feel for you girl, don't never stop

I can't say love, not without you
No, not that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deeply, but no, not love
No, not without you
I can't say love, no not without you
Can't say that word, love
Not without you
Say I like maybe, I care maybe
I feel deeply, but no, not love",Can't Say Love
Glenn Lewis,"I remember when
I stood in this very place and I told you
I'm always there for you

You understand we're better than anyone still I act the fool
When I know that you're the truth
I complicate when the simple fact has always been right here
Till the day right in front of my face

When it's not the same
That the difference between love and lust ain't win or lose
But it's how you play the game

[Chorus]
And I see your face
There's so many places I been
All I , all I see is you
Been so many places
And I see your face
All I , all I see is you

I've been telling myself
All this time that I am ready
The same excuse I play it off when I'm with you
But I'm so much better when I'm with you

Where to over guide
The rest is wasting time
I complicate when the simple fact has always been right here
Till the day you're right in front of my face

When it's not the same
That the difference between love and lust ain't win or lose
But it's how you play the game

[Chorus]
And I see your face
There's so many places I been
All I , all I see is you
Been so many places
And I see your face
All I , all I see is you

The deepest places in my mind
In my dreams, when I close my eyes
We've been friends forever
Sometimes it's like we're together
When I tell myself
Thoughts of you make it harder
And it ain't nothing new
'Cause baby I know that it's you

[Chorus]

There's so many places I been
All I , all I see is you

Glenn Lewis,"Say if I was your boyfriend
And your boyfriend was me
He would be so secure
He wouldn't have to compete
Maybe I'm just that fly
That he thinks that you'll leave
'Cause as pretty as you are
You deserve finer things

Don't he know when you carry gold
You can't toss it around like it's silver
You never see it glitter
And so just let him know
That someone like me is around the corner
Waiting my turn just to deliver

[Chorus]
All my love as your heart is tender
And soft as a whisper
Wanna give you all , all my heart
'Cause your heart is tender
And soft as a whisper

If I was your girlfriend
And your girlfriend was me
You wouldn't want no other
'Cause I'd be all you need
With your love like a candle
Hold you down like a queen
Be the beat to my name
If you know what I mean

Boy you know that my heart is gold
So don't play around like it's some silver
You say you can't deliver
If you should go
There's some other G right round the corner
Waiting his turn if you don't wanna

And soft as a whisper
Wanna give you all , all my heart

I can't wait until we are away
'Cause last night
Is just a preview to the love we'll make

It's morning time
To see the sun shining off your face
Really just reminds
Of how more beautiful you are each day

Faithfully how we still love so deep
Much better than a fantasy
You and I became we
I believe more than what I can see
Keep on believing mind could conceive
God must really love me

The way we are is no coincidence
'Cause both of us
We know that love is more than just a gift
It's more than trust
It's how we know that destiny exists

Faithfully how we still love so deep

And to receive a love like ours
Everything we've been through

To fill this gap in between us
Relax just let me hold you

It only kills what was built with the bricks
Don't let nothing come between us but
Opportunity and space

In order for two of us to become one
We have to get a little bit closer
And they spell the hesitation
'Cause nothing makes better than us

Ooh oh oh

I used to think I lived, to be in love, 
But what I had to give was not enough.

Now you look into the mirror and you'll see
The reflection of just how our love used to be.

And though, we had it all,
We wanted even more

Even more

We don't have to look for love, 

It's knocking at our door

I said let's take it slow, but you didn't care.

What was to be our future is now our past.
And I am the best that you will find.
We were both the best we left behind,
And though, we had it all,
We wanted even more,
Even more,
Wanted so much more,
We don't have to look for love,

And though, we had it all,

Glenn Medeiros,"Why do I seem to be caught up inside a dream
All my life, it's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder there's always a voice somewhere
Saying I never should try to set my heart free
I wish that love would come and take me in her arms
Show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone, words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

I try and say I love you but the words won't come through
In my eyes, see all the tears and sad memories
Why can't I start out new and leave that old feeling too far behind
I guess that lonely needs company
Around each bend of road
I'm thinking that in time there will be that rainbow's end
But when I follow those self illusions
I find that it's only lonely and me again

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

Lonely won't leave me alone
I wish that love would come
Lonely won't leave me alone
And take me home

One night can leave you broken hearted
Too late now; I've already started

And deeper I go, the more I'm believing
But my heart needs to know
I'm fallin'
And maybe this time I can hold on to love
'Cause I want it enough; can't you see that
I'm fallin'?

Forever and always, that's the promise she made
Only words that will soon fade away
And I believed her but never again
That's what I said
Last thing I needed was to fall for another
But I got this feelin' you can make me forget
One night can leave you broken hearted
Too late now; I've already started

And like a bright moonbeam, 
Your spirit lights my dreams

Like a sailor lost at sea
Life is a trip we could be taking
So won't you travel on with me?

Bright down in Rio De Janiero
Comes a gent with a mellow instrument
And a colorful sombrero,
Then he sings and the melody he brings 
So tenderly played 
Is called the Gaucho Serenade.

Si, Senor he's a happy troubadour 
On a patio you'll find him.
Si Senor, he will go from door to door
Leaving happiness behind him.
All the sweet Senoritas hurry out to join the parade

Glenn Miller,"In an old Dutch garden by an old Dutch mill,
Where the moon was dreaming on a distant hill,
When a smile danced by it was then that I saw
Heaven in a pair of wooden shoes.

In an old Dutch garden where the tulips grow
That's where I first whispered that I love you so
For my heart was blue till I gave it to 
An angel in a pair of wooden shoes.

Then one sad day when summer meets September
I sailed away from a thrill I will remember,
In an old Dutch garden by an old Dutch mill
Every day I pray that you are waiting still
For my heart will yearn until I return 
To Heaven in a pair of wooden shoes",In an Old Dutch Garden (By an Old Dutch Mill)

You're the tear that comes after June time's laughter

By a word that somebody left unspoken

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go journeying?
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane?

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Glenn Miller,"That certain night, the night we met 
There was magic abroad in the air 
There were angels dining at the Ritz 
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square 
I maybe right, I maybe wrong 

But I'm perfectly willing to swear 
That when you turned and smiled at me 
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square 
The moon that lingered over London town 
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown 

How could he know we two were so in love 
The whole darn world seemed upside down 
The streets uptown were paved with stars 
It was such a romantic affair 
And as we kissed and said goodnight 
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square!",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square

While the wind is sobbing 
Underneath the stars

Like two guitars 

Love here in the starlit hour

Let me dream forever 
Underneath the silvery skies 

Will it be just as sweet again, 
The glamor, the glory that we know 
Will I find when we meet again 
The glamor, the glory's still a glow 

But tonight let us forget tomorrow 
Here under the midnight blue 
Love will bloom and flower 
In the starlit hour with you...",The Starlit Hour

Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me

What I feel for you is real love.
In other's eyes I see reflected a hurt, scorned, rejected.

Love Child, born  in poverty,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.
Love Child, never meant to be,
Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.

I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me.

Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

That all I longed for long ago was you

He'll be back on his knees to express himself

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Glenn Miller,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Glenn Miller,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop.",Little Brown Jug
Glenn Miller,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you.

You are the one
Only you beneath the moon 
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
No matter, darling Where you are

In the silence of my lonely room

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

As recorded by the Glenn Miller on November 24th 1941 with Ray Eberle.
there'll be bluebirds over

That thrills and delights me, 
Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation,

When you're in my arms 
And I feel you so close to me,

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night

Won't you tell me where my love can be? 
Is there a meadow in the mist 
Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

And down and down I go; round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame.
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire.

For you're the lover I have waited for,

Stars were peek-a-booing down

And still she's in my heart

They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me
'Cause I don't want to walk without you
No, sire",I Don't Want to Walk Without You
Glenn Miller,"They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
And now you hear it everywhere

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot

The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much

Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

I dreamed of two blue orchids
So full of love and light
That I wanted to possess each tender bloom

And through a thousand springs
Blue orchids seemed in a world apart

Something pale and blue
Came stealing from the meadows of my heart

We didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so
Yo I got a message for my fans and friends
The last album was dope y'all and here we go again!

No applause, no applause, thank you, thank you
We're back again, and we're plannin on rockin you
ten times harder than any other crew can
Jeff is like Conan, I'm like Tarzan
In other words, wherever we go
Hahah! We're runnin the show, but no
seriously, it's been a while since we dropped one
But it's out now, go buy the album
If you bought the last one you know it was krush
But if you didn't man, you must not
know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again!
A lot of people may not have bought the last album
Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them
to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end..
.. here we go again!

When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin, ""What's takin so long
for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?""
I said, ""Hold up - let me explain.
When you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!'
Sorry we gotta go
We got another show tomorrow night in Rio""
The point I'm tryin to make is to let you all know
It takes a LONG TIME to travel the globe
But now we gotta start this whole process all over again

Without you, we would not have been able to sell
as many records, we went top ten
And got real and we'll do it again

Mean as a miser, low as a snake 
Scared as a rabbit, small as a might 
Gay as a meadowlark, high as a kite 
Wild as a tiger, drunk as a fool 
Sour as a lemon and stubborn as a mule 
Sharp as a razor, smooth as a glove

Slow as a tortoise, mixed as a hash 
Fierce as a lion, meek as a lamb

Dead as a doornail, dumb as a dolt 
Spry as a kitten, and frisky as a colt 
Good as an angel in heaven above 
That means, partner, I'm in love...!

Glenn Miller,"High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you 
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space
Oh, into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name 

Into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name",High on a Windy Hill
Glenn Miller,"There were shadows on the sand, closely mingled, 
Just two lovers by a moonlit sea 
While I watched I thought of you and I tingled 
For they kissed the way that you did me 
Then the shadows came much nearer 
And the moon was like a spotlight then 
There was one familiar face showing clearer 
It was you, I couldn't look again... 
I felt so sad 
There you were with someone new 
I felt so glad 
When I found it wasn't true 
For the shadows on the sand seemed to break up 
And I looked around me with a start 
When the pounding of my heart made me wake up 
From a dream that nearly broke my heart...!",Shadows on the Sand
Glenn Miller,"You are oh! so close to me 
I hold you tenderly 
And hear you say, ""I love you""

If dreams can bring so near to me 
The things so dear to me 
The lips that say, ""I love you"" 

Then I know that Ill go on daydreaming 
Until my daydreams all come true...

A million dreams ago 
You held me in your arms

So many nights alone

I'll lock my memories here in my heart 

And here in my heart they'll stay 
And through the years 
they'll always be part,

So many times I wish that one little dream came true

I only hope that same ol' song is in both our hearts 
To hear you confess that your care has been my prayer 
So many times, my darling, so many times!",So Many Times

Somehow I want to cry 
I know your sweet and idle chatter 
Really means goodbye

While you break my heart 

What of all the moon dreams 
Shared together beside a garden wall

He said ""Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood""

Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance

Who's giving that line to you?
You think it's divine, do you?
You're a crazy Humpty Dumpty heart.
You're letting a grin kid you,
You never did win, did you?
Just a silly Humpty Dumpty heart.
Don't mean to criticize, or say I'm wise,
But if you will just recall, you sat on a garden wall,
And you know what happened
You'll still have a chance won't you?
You sure want romance, don't you

We're making shells by the ton, ton, ton.

Glenn Miller,"South of the border - down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love, where the stars above - came out to play
And now as I wander - my thoughts ever stray
South of the border - down Mexico way

She was a picture - in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay
South of the border - Mexico way

Then she smiled as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""manana""
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border - I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white, by the candle light - she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me (ding-dong) - that I musn't stay

Glenn Miller,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Glenn Miller,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes it best is eight to the bar 
When he plays it's a ball 
He is the daddy of them all... 
The people gather round when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Beat me daddy, eight to bar!"" 
 A plink, plunkin' on the keys
 A riff, well, a-riffin' out with ease 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Come on and beat me daddy, eight to bar!""",Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon!"" 
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams 
All around a pugnosed dream 

The music started and was I the perplexed one 
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?"" 
In my frightened arms polka dots and moonbeams 
Sparkled on a pugnosed dream 

There were questions in the eyes of all the dancers 
As we floated over the floor 
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers 
And perhaps a few things more...

Unhappy and should get shot of you

But if you do 
You'll be much stronger cos you tried 
The mighty fall 
A world gone mad beneath it all 
Nothing to loose 
Step through and watch all hell break loose 
Rip away the rotten wood 
You've been reborn 
End the lies and face the truth 
The blackness comes 
The risk no greater than the gain 
But if you stay 
Your soul evaporates away 
Cyclonic winds 
Will blow away the sins you gained 
A tidal wave 
Can take you where you've never been 
Clear the haze inside your brain 
You've been reborn 
End it all and start again 
Gonna lie in wait 
For a hurricane 
And for sure when I'm 
Inside I'll shed my skin 
Don't assume 
You are doomed 
In the stratosphere 
Only way to escape 
And get out of here 
If you should see the devil there 
Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn 
If you should see the devil there 
Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn

But if you do 
You'll be much stronger cos you tried 
As your life disintegrates 
You've been reborn 
When confusion blows your brain

End the lies and end the pain 
You've been reborn 
End it all and start again

And I want to paint it black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black

I see a line of cars
And they are painted black
They pass me by with one
Who's never coming back

And see my heart is black
I see a red door
And I have to have it black

Maybe I'll fade away
And not have to face the fact
That it's not easy
When your whole world's turning black

Paint it black
My whole world's black

If we look hard enough
Into the setting sun
These things will last with me
Before the morning comes

I see them walking by
All dressed up in their clothes
I have to turn away
Until my blackness goes

Paint it black

Just looking for ways to survive
I never did quite realize
How time eats away at your life

Now I am older for sure
And close to the end of it all
So I reflect with hindsight
Sitting alone every night

And I was desperate to find
The things I have here by my side
Now that I've let it all go
I cry for the children so

And I've spent all my life
Searching for nothing
And I've wasted my time
To end up with nothing

And I tried so hard to understand
The yearnings of a younger man
I know that I would change my plans
If I could take my time again

When I was young and alive
Just looking for ways to survive
I never did quite realize
How time eats away at your life

I have spent all my life
Searching for nothing
And I wasted my time
And it's all come to nothing

When I was young and alive
I needed nothing
Now I am ready to die
I've still got nothing

Glenn Yarbrough,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring
No song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, baby of my heart",I Just Called to Say I Love You
Glenn Yarbrough,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Glenn Yarbrough,"Somewhere, my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

Is wonderful, wonderful

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

How you used to be
So drown
You were angels
So much more than everything

I could've held onto your heart

I swear by my tattoo.
There was Mermaid Minnie, met her down in Madagascar.
She would kiss me,
Anytime that I would ask her.
Then one evening, her flame of love blew out,
Blow me down and pick me up, 
She swapped me for a trout.

That sailors can't afford.
Sailors can't afford.
And when spent my last red cent,
She tossed my overboard.
Gotta a whale of a tale to tell you lad.
It's a whale of a tale or two,
About the flappin' fish and girls, I've loved on nights like this, With the moon above.
And a whale of a tale, 
It's all true, 
I swear by my tattoo!

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden

Does it still run down to Donny cove?

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Were got to make it last
Got to fan the spark

But still they fall in love

Gloria Estefan,"There's a part of me that's dying every time I hear your name
There's a part of me that's trying to bring back your love again
There are times when I just want to run, but there's no place to hide
Even though mu heart is breaking in a million bits inside
I can make believe that none of this is true

But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday
What we lost yesterday

There are nights when I lay wide awake thinking of how good it could be
Other nights I don't feel worthy of the love you gave to me
I remember not too long ago we both were here to stay
But it seems it happened overnight when I threw it all away
I can walk away and find somebody new

But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday
What we lost yesterday

Hope that I can make you love me once again but I can't forget you

Gloria Estefan,"If I could just close my eyes
See just what I wanted to see
It would be much easier to live this life
Thinkin' that it never really comes down to me

Sometimes I wanna close my eyes
So I can't see time while it's slippin' away
We're all walkin' on a very fine line
'Til reality is somehow thrown in our face

Bury it deep and maybe you won't feel the pain
(Feel the pain)
But you can't let it go
Down the line, will be back again

If we could all close our eyes
All the things we know that are wrong
We could live, selfishly protected lives
Not even think about, what we could have done

Say it's not there and maybe it will go away
(Go away)
But the truth is it won't
Down the line, will be back again
It will be back again

Rather than examine it
Maybe I should handle it
What good is it, to close my eyes
And tell myself another lie
I gotta get along somehow and sometimes the only way
Is to close my eyes

Somtimes I have to close my eyes
Let you think, you can make a fool out of me
Guess I set myself up each time
By trustin' you, so openly
Yeah, that's the way I wanna be
That's the way I wanna be
Woo

Where will it all lead,

To create something new that will take you far
I know that you can manage
To scatter some hope, 'cause it's not too late

For I've finally realized that I could be

Out of my darkest hour

'Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
It's bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

You know now this is true
When I tell you I love you
Ooh oh yeah",I See Your Smile [#]
Gloria Estefan,"Take me only for what I am
You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand

No one has the right to say
This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way

Find common ground
Go in between
Things aren't always what they seem

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

Love is love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

Why always take
The upper hand
It's better to understand

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
I believe in love but with no conditions
Oye mi canto
And giving in sometimes
Doesn't make it submission
Oye mi canto
Hate is so common it's almost tradition
Oye mi canto
Come on let's leave it behind
And make that transition
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto
Oye mi canto

Paint a yuletide valentine
Back home i go to those i know
For a christmas auld lang syne

Our voices all combine
In sweet accord to thank our lord
For a christmas auld lang syne

And the children's faces shine
With each new toy we share their joy
With a christmas auld lang syne

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Gloria Estefan,"City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing
Greeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Strings of street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright reg and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you hear

It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Tu firma junto al clavel me puso triste

De su dolor de su propio llanto

Tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
Tiene nostalgia como su voz
Y esa canción que sigue entonando
Corre en la sangre y sigue llegando
Con más fuerza al corazón

Sigue el güajiro entonando el son.
Y cada calle que va a mi pueblo
Tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
La nostalgia como su voz.

Gloria Estefan,"No pensé que fueras a dejarme
Dices que te has vuelto a enamorar
Que no sientes ya el amor de antes
Quieres que te dé tu libertad

No te detendré por un instante
No le temo a la soledad
Pero se que al fin te vas a arrepentir
Y tendrás que regresar

En tu alma siempre seras mio
Aunque te enamores otra vez
No podrás borrar esos recuerdos
De mis caricias en tu piel

Te recordarás en cada beso
Nadie como yo te puede amar
Sé, te cansarás de las mentiras
Y tu volverás

No voy a tratar de retenerte
El amor no se exige, se da
Y si tu amor no es el de para siempre
Entonces quiero saberlo ya

No te vale nada mi carino
Solo te sirvió para jugar
Pero se que al fin te vas a arrepentir
Y tendrás que regresar

En tu alma siempre serás mio
Aunque te enamores otra vez
No podrás borrar esos recuerdos
De mis caricias en tu piel

You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand.

Go in between

Someday it'll be alright

Don't take your love away from me.
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,
Breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight,
And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

Can't we give our love just one more try?

The nights the time for your tears
Your heart may be broken tonight
But tomorrow in the morning light

And with them go all your tears
But the morning will bring joy
For every girl and boy, so
Dont let the sun catch you crying

But stop your crying when the birds sing

It may be hard to discover
That youve been left for another
But dont forget that loves a game

Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
Remember that you're mine sweetheart

Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you

How can I be sure where I stand with you?

I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.

 Souvenirs of days together
 The ring he used to wear
 Pages from an old love letter
 Traces of a love long ago that didn't work out right
 Traces of love with me tonight

 That in his heart he'll find a trace of love still there,

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, they need love to help them heal

Gloria Estefan,"Tengo las cuerdas de mi guitarra
Tengo la noche y tengo mi voz
Para entregarte con toda
El alma las dulces notas de mi canción

Son las tristezas y la nostalgia
Las amarguras del corazón
Son tus recuerdos en la distancia
Los que me llenan de inspiración

Con todo el amor del alma
Te espero en el año nuevo
Y quiero con mi guitarra decirte
Lo que yo siento

Que siempre te estoy queriendo
Que siempre te estoy soñando
Sin ti yo me estoy muriendo
Pero te sigo esperando

Tengo la brisa por mi ventana
Que me acaricia como tu voz
Tengo grabadas dentro del alma
Las dulces huellas de tu pasión

Voy sumergiéndome en la nostalgia
Cuando en las noches yo pienso en ti
Hay una lágrima que se escapa
Porque te siento lejos de mí

Con todo el amor del alma
Te espero en el año nuevo
Y quiero con mi guitarra decirte
Lo que yo siento

Que siempre te estoy queriendo
Que siempre te estoy soñando
Sin ti yo me estoy muriendo
Pero te sigo esperando
Ay, ay, ay

Con todo el amor del alma
Te espero en el año nuevo
Y quiero con mi guitarra decirte
Lo que yo siento

Que siempre te estoy queriendo
Que siempre te estoy soñando
Sin ti yo me estoy muriendo
Pero te sigo esperando

Es este canto que lleva el viento
La voz que clama por verte ya
Es la esperanza de tu regreso
Un rayo de luz en mi soledad

Al despertar en las noches siento
Que moriré de tanto esperar
Pero al saber que estaremos juntos sé
Que mi pena va a terminar

Con todo el amor del alma
Te espero en el año nuevo
Y quiero con mi guitarra decirte
Lo que yo siento

Que siempre te estoy queriendo
Que siempre te estoy soñando
Sin ti yo me estoy muriendo
Pero te sigo esperando

Con todo el amor del alma
Te espero en el año nuevo
Y quiero con mi guitarra decirte
Lo que yo siento

Que siempre te estoy queriendo
Que siempre te estoy soñando
Sin ti yo me estoy muriendo
Pero te sigo esperando

Que el año nuevo me traiga tu amor
Y vamos todos juntos a brindar con alegría
Ay, por el año viejo que se va y el nuevo día

Ya se cruzan los abrazos brota el llanto de emoción
Todos juntos como hermanos en un sólo corazón

Gloria Estefan,"This song is a blend of merengue ""pambiche"" (one of the most comples merengue grooves) with vallenato. the fast intricate melodic lines from the saxophone section, brass section, stee
Ing guitar, and the accordion gives the song a totally fresh taste to the rhythmic and sonic texture. the lyrics of this song are about how good it is to have love in our hearts for the people
Mean the most to us. it says ""bad moments are gone, and the good times are coming"". in the chorus we ask for three wishes (tres deseos) to the little eastern star. they are let you

Gloria Estefan,"I've been alone inside myself for far too long 
Never really wanted it that way but I let it happen 
If I could do it all again my life would be 
Infinitely better than before I wouldn´t waste a moment 

I'd make time for laughing with my friends 
Make love, make music, make amends 
Try to make a difference, try to love, try to understand 
Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command 

But there´s always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That´s why there´s always tomorrow 

I guess it took a little time, for me to see 
The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have to go through 
For I've finally realized that I could be 
Infinitely better than before, definitely stronger 
I'll face whatever comes my way 
Savor each moment of the day 
Love as many people as I can along the way
Help someone who´s giving up if it´s just to raise my eyes and pray. 

But there's always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That´s why there´s always tomorrow 

Before your last setting sun 
And everything your heart has longed for 
Has yet to be (one) 
Yes there´s always tomorrow though people come and they go 
But if you´ve brought some love to their lives 
Then you've got something to show (to show)

But there's always, always, always tomorrow to start over again 
Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing is change 
That's why there's always, always, always, always, always, always tomorrow",Always Tomorrow
Gloria Estefan,"I get a little tongue twisted
Every time I talk to you when I see you
And I'm so glad that you just missed it
The way I stared to memorize your face

To kiss you in my mind
Love you all the time

'Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
It's bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

Please believe it's true
When I tell you I love you

I've taken too many chances
Searching for the truth in love that's in my heart
Tell me if I made the wrong advances
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed

'Cause I know I have to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it?

'Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
It's bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

Please believe it's true
When I tell you I love you

I had to let you know just what would happen
Yes I had to let you know the truth
I know I've got to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it? Would you?

'Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
It's bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

'Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
It's bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

You know now this is true
When I tell you I love you

Gloria Estefan,"Hay amores que se esfuman con los años
Hay amores que su llama sigue viva
Los inciertos, que son rosa y son espina
Y hay amores de los buenos, como tú
Hay amores que se siembran y florecen
Hay amores que terminan en sequía 
Los que traen desengaños en la vida
Y hay amores de los buenos, como tú 

Mi amor, mi buen amor, mi delirio
No pretendas que te olvide así, no más 
Que tu amor fue mar cuando sedienta
Me arrimé a tu puerto a descansar
Que tu amor, amor, sólo el que un día 
En tu pecho, vida mía, me dio la felicidad 

Hay amores que nos llevan al abismo
Hay amores que jamás se nos olvidan
Los que dan toda ternura y fantasía 
Son amores de los buenos como tú 

Mi amor, mi buen amor, mi delirio 
No pretendas que sea poco mi penar 
Que tu amor fue luz de pleno día 
Cuando todo era oscuridad 
Que tu amor, amor sólo el que un día 
En tu pecho, vida mía, me dio la felicidad 
En tu pecho, vida mía, me dio la felicidad",Mi Buen Amor

Gloria Estefan,"I thought that I knew all there was to know
I knew all about love
I lived the highs and made it through the lows
I knew all about love
But now I must admit I'm surprised
And feel I've only scratched the surface
'Cause baby when I look in your eyes
I understand my one true purpose

You were sent to me
By angels up above, I'm certain
I thought I'd show you what love can be
But what did I know
Until along came you
To teach me about love
Oh yes, along came you
To teach me about love

And as this feeling grows with every day
You awaken my heart
A heart so full I fear that it may break
If we're ever apart
And though one day you'll be own your own
You know I always will be near you
As near as on the day you were born
Call on me, you know I'll hear you

You were sent to me
For one reason, I can tell you
You're here to show me what love can be

Gloria Estefan,"Destiny
Has once again surprised me
Oh destiny
Must want you here beside me
Quietly
Like the sunrise with its splendor
Unexpectedly
With a passion strong yet tneder
You draw me in
Lke the moon draws the tide
Swept away by this love
Taken in by your eyes
If I had to walk away from you
I know that it would be no use
'Cause you're so deep inside of me
Can't deny
I never want to be set free
The more you give the more I need
You can't change what is meant to be
No you can't change destiny
Destiny
Destiny
Speakd with many voices
So eventually
We're obliged to make some choices
Oh destiny
Who I thought I owned completely
Just to toy with me
Made me fall in love so deeply
You fill my soul
Like the sears fill the sky
Brought to life
This nnew world
Where I'm held captive inside
If I had to walk away from you
I know that it would be no use
'Cause you're so deep inside of me
Can't deny
I never want to be set free
The more you give the more I need
You can't change what is meant to be
No, you can't change destiny
If I had to walk away from you
I know that it would be no use
No you can't change destiny

Gloria Estefan,"Only time can bring the peace of mind you treasure
Only love can really break your heart
But we must feel the pain before the pleasure
Only then can we tell them apart

We are never too afraid of taking chances
Searching in the dark with no concerns
But it's always the same with all romances
It's the heart that never seems to learn

Thinking that it's finally my turn
Like a fool believing every word
You tell me that it's over but that's not what I heard
'Cause my heart just never seems to learn

Many times, I've wished that love had never found me
After knowing all the pain it brings
Always hoping to feel your arms around me
Without fear of losing everything

It's the heart that will awaken all the senses
And the senses light up the soul
But we hide what we feel with more pretenses
Than the pride that comes before the fall

Thinking that it's finally my turn
Like a fool believing every word
You tell me that it's over but that's not what I heard
'Cause my heart just never seems to learn

How can I ever find what I've always wanted
With a heart that never seems to learn
Never seems to learn
",The Heart Never Learns
Gloria Estefan,"Here we go, here we go now

I saw a girl today
Could tell from what she say
She was a liar
She walks a wire
I tried to make here see
That this was not the way
Of getting higher
And then she turned away, so I say hear me now
Just understand, don't get me wrong
You got to live your life, live it right,
Or you'll go back to the end of the line
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go
Higher move along, higher get off the ground
Higher lift it up, higher

There is a man I know
And everyplace he'd go he'd take your money
Think it was funny
He'd like to get his way, he never likes to pay
The law would chase him
But he just run away, so I say hear me now
Just understand, don't get me wrong
You got to live your life, live it right,
Or you'll go back to the end of the line
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go
Higher move along, higher get of the ground
Higher lift it up, higher here we go, here we go now

I gotta friend who lives on all the love he gives
When he retires, he's going higher
One thing I know is true, that everything you do
Will come back to you, don't let it fool you
And I say hear me now
Just understand, don't get me wrong you got to live your life, and live it right,
Or you'll go back to the end of the line
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go

Higher lift it up, higher here we go, here we go now

Gloria Estefan,"Baby, it's nothing that you've said
But I know it's not just in my head
You're changing, baby, and you don't think I see
I feel you drifting away, a little bit further every day
Don't tell me, baby, don't tell me it's just me

I see it in the look that's on your face
Something's not the same inside
You can't keep it from me, no matter how you try

'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell
When you look away, there's something you're hiding
I know you too well, too well

Maybe the timing isn't right
Maybe I see the end in sight
Is it over baby, is it hurting you to stay?
Maybe you don't know what to do
You can't find a way to break the news
Think it over, baby, it hurts me more this way

I'd rather have you tell me to my face
Than tell me every thing's all right
What you don't wanna say is there in black and white

'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell
When you look away, there's something you're hiding

Gloria Estefan,"Love, love, love, love, love
Say the word so very losely
Where we come from is love, love, pure love
And we're on our way back home

And on that way, you never look back
'Cause there's nothing there to see
Just look around you
There's always someone that's in need

Of Maybe just kindness
As we watch each other bleed
From wounds we choose
We never lose

Love, love, love, love, love
Misunderstood yet so desired
We pay the cost for love, love, real love
But we get back so much more, so much more

So many questions
Beginning to unfold
I look for the answers
In the middle of my soul

I know you're out there
And it's not like I've been told
So I run to you
I run to you

To find the path of the right love
Oh yeah the path of the right love
We're on the path of the one love
Oh yeah the path of the right love

Love, love, love, love, love
All around yet so elusive
If we don't reach out for love, love, this love
We're all just wasting time, precious time

When in the long run
What's meant to be will be
Those things we ask for
Become our destiny

But while we're living
Our souls can not be free
Eventually, we will come to see
To find the path of the right love, right love, right love

Oh yeah the path of the right love
We're on the path of the one love, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah the path of the right love
And that love, love, love, true love

Must surely be good, must surely be kind
And that love sweet love, strong love
Is meant to be yours, is meant to be mine
And I do believe if we share this life

We must learn to share all it's pain and strife
To find the path of the right love
Oh yeah the path of the right love
We're on the path of the one love

Oh yeah the path of the right love
To find the path of the right love

And every grace will be given you",Path of the Right Love
Gloria Estefan,"I don't mean to be the teardrop spilling over your resentments
Don't intend to be the cry with which you voice your discontent
I don't wanna be a picture, fading slowly from your memory
Don't intend to be a shadow simply darkening your passage

Only wanna lose myself behind the mirror of your eyes
Be the only balm that soothes the secret passions in your life
Only want to lose my senses, lose your sorrow calm this madness
Be the only one you count on to alleviate your sadness

I'll steal your heart and set it free
Tear down the walls that would surround you
I may hold you close to me
But these ties will never bind you

I don't mean to be the fire that's igniting your temptations
Don't intend to be the sword that runs you through with adoration
I don't want to be a whisper, my emotions wrapped in silence
Don't intend to be the shout, reminding you that time is priceless

Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that we've found
Only want to breathe your essence, be your comfort, fill with laughter
Every moment that we live from this day on, forever after

I'll steal your heart and set it free
So free, I'm sure it will astound you
Without my love you'll never be
In some way, I'll always find you

I'll steal your heart and set it free
Tear down the walls that would surround you
I may hold you close to me
But these ties will never bind you

Only want to be the wind that lifts you high above the ground
Living only to unleash the sacred powers that we've found
Only want to breathe your essence, be your comfort, fill with laughter
Every moment that we live from this day on, forever after

I'll steal your heart and set it free
So free, I'm sure it will astound you
Without my love you'll never be
In some way, I'll always find you

Asked her what's her name, she said, Gloria

She said: are you a dealer from Havana?
No, no
Yo, can I buy you a tequila?

Now with one drink, I'll put her in a spell

This new found love will find no end
Don't wanna feel, another feeling
Don't wanna know what time will send

But don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing
We can find a way
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today
Don't stop (stop), stop the hands of time
Hold back the time
And make forever, the same as the moment I felt your love
You've touched my heart
Erase the pain, the memories, and mistakes I made

Stop, the earth from turning, the rain from falling, the wind from blowing
But don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing
We can find a way
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today
Don't stop (stop), the flame from burning
Stop tomorrow's hurting, from seeing the light
Don't stop (stop), my heart from beating
Keep the time from fleeting, into the night
Can't think about tomorrow's fears, 'cause today is here to stay
Clear away all of yesterday's tears, there's nothing to block our way

Stop, the earth from turning, the rain from falling, the wind from blowing, the sun from shining
Can't find the reason, another season
Could never match a love so pleasin'

You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take a stand

This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way

Find common ground
Go in between
Things aren't always what they seem

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

Love is love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

Why always take
The upper hand
It's better to understand

Someday it'll be alright

Gloria Estefan,"Como duele en dia nublado
Como el tiempo es tanpesado
Si, porque a diario pienso en ti

Que bien grita el silencio
Que bien duelen los
Recuedos si, porque todo habla de ti

Que delicia tu sensualidad
Que locura cuando te sentia muy de cerca, why ahora que estas lejos hasta el universo a muerto

Como fue que tu me dejaste
De querer te olvidaste del ayer de nuestras miradas de nuestra piel no te duele si me vez lo que fue perfecto why acordado fiel lo que me queda por decir es como duele perderte
Ay ay ay ay ay
Como me duele...

Que pequeño se hare el cielo que humillante es el deseo si porque ya no estas aqui

Que sincero se hare el frio como ayer en mi sufrimiento ya no se lo que es vivir

Que delicia tu sensualidad
Que locura cuando te sentia muy de cerca, why ahora que estas lejos hasta el universo a muerto

Tu perdon

En las noches
Te busco why no te encuentro
Tu ausencia me causa gran dolor
Solo se que hoy te extraÃ±o
Why que me arrepiento
Tu adios es muy amargo
Para aquella que una vez
Probo tu amor

Regresa a mi, quiero sentir
El calor de tu piel
Me cego la tentacion
No vuelve a suceder
Estar sin ti es un sufrir
DEMASIADO cruel
SIN tu amor no quiero seguir

Hoy dudas de mis palabras
La verdad es que no te culpo
Pero aun vive la ESPERANZA

Tu perdon

Translation:

I never meant to hurt you with the things I did
But I know my actions hurt your feelings
Oh yes, I know

On a summer day
My heart is in winter
And I'm still waiting for you to come back
And to forgive me

At night I look for you
But can't find you
Your absence causes me pain
All I know is that I miss you
And that I'm very sorry
To someone who once tasted your love
Your goodbye is very bitter

Come back to me
I want to feel your warm skin
Temptation blinded me
It will never happen again
Being without you
Is too cruel a suffering
I don't' want to live without your love
Please come back

I know you doubt my word
I can't really blame you
But the hope still lives in me
That you'll come back and forgive me

(Give me another chance)
So you can see that I've really changed
(Give me another chance)
I want to show you that I'm only yours, only yours
(Give me anther chance)
Your goodbye hurts me deep inside
(Give me another chance)
Forgive, forgive, forgive me
I ask you on my knees
I promise it will never happen again

(The only thing I ask that you give me one more chance)
I only, only want one more chance
(The only thing I ask is that you give me one more chance)
Come back to me because I need your love
And this really hurts
(The only thing I ask you is one more chance)

(Give me anther chance)

I never meant to hurt you with the things I did
But the hope still lives in me
That you'll return
And give me your forgiveness

Gloria Estefan,"Se fue muriendo el fuego
Que llevábamos por dentro
Se apagaban los deseos
Dominaban más los celos
Que nuestros momentos

Buscábamos palabras
En lugar de algunos versos
Preocupaba más el día
Que la bien amada noche
Y el sensual encuentro

Y con el tiempo se olvidaba el romance
Qué decir de los besos y del dulce amor
Las caricias se cambiaban por dudas
Nuestra cama un desierto donde muero de sed

Me voy y no regresaré
Porque acaba lo nuestro
Y eso dalo por un hecho
Te ví, y te llegué a querer
Ahora no sabes nada
Quieres tiempo y no me hablas

Me voy así como llegué
Ahorrándome palabras con sólo la mirada
Dirás que nunca lo intenté
Pero es que tú bien sabes
De mi tú lo has aprendido
No se ignora al corazón

Jamás se dió el momento
Para acariciar lo nuestro
Con tu cruel indiferencia
Se moría mi paciencia junto con tu amor

Lo que llevábamos muy dentro
Se fué muriendo lento
Al compás de tu mirada
Que no me decía nada
Despertando así el rencor

Y con el tiempo se olvidaba el romance
Qué decir de los besos y del dulce amor
Las caricias se cambiaban por dudas
Nuestra cama un desierto donde muero de sed

Dame más de tus besos que me saben a café
Oye baby, no me dejes de mirar
Que la luna se me apaga si tus ojos no están

Me siento medio enfermo de vivir sin tu amor
Pero no quiero ambulancia, mucho menos doctor

Quiero tener tu cariño a mi lado otra vez
Tu boquita azucarada que me hace enloquecer
Te llevo pá la disco pa' que sientas mi swing
Y todo lo que hace es hacerme sufrir

Y una, y dos, y tres noches sin ti
Sintiendo la agonía que no me deja vivir
No tengo corazón y voy a padecer
Sólo te pido no me dejes de querer, sí

Con la mano, arriba, arriba
Arriba, arriba, arriba, yeah

Tu belleza angelical
Las flores se marchitan
Angustiadas why celosas

No hay día que no amanesca
El sol en tu mirada
Se escondem las estrellas
En las noches que no estas

Son tantos los poetas
Que te intentan piropear
Tesouro que piratas
Buscan sin cesar

Tu risa es una orquesta
Que me pone a bailar
No hay presio que le ponga
A esta felicidad

Tu eres corazón, mi vida
Regalo que díos me ha dado a mi
La suerte me acompaña
Porque te tengo a ti
Llenaste el vacio
Que antes habia en mi

La luz de aquella luna
Brilla para los dos
Me lleva de alivio

Solo escuchar tu voz
Prometeme que nunca
Jamas olvidaras

Como barco a la deriva en tempestad
Sin rumbo, navegando por el mar de

En tu corazon de piedra encalle
Como un ancla en mi alma, esta
Enterrado tu adios

Encalle escuchando de tu boca

Como sirena, yo nade en los mares de
Tus cuentos

En mis lagrimas me ahoque

Cuando sabes que tu amor no
Es correspondido

Reenforze el mastil con fe why zarpe
A un destino incierto
Esperanzada por hallar aquel carino
Que me nutra con la miel

De amor puro why fiel
Que solo en suenos pude imaginar
Cuando era nina

El arrecife de tu amor
Ya esta marcado
Una huella en mi alma
Has dejado

Lluminada de sufrir
Faro que he puesto alli
Para que sirva como aviso
Para mi

why es que tu amor es

Sonara una alerta

Que sirva de advertencia
Para todo aquel que quiera navegar
Why para todo aquel como yo
Que se vuelve a enamorar

Dice alerta, peligro, alli hay

why es que llegaste tu entre las nubes negras
Ya no siento dolor, rompiste las cadenzas que me
Ataban con temor

Casi pierdo la esperanza
Es que el abismo donde cai era tan grande
Senti ahogarme

A la deriva en un mar de seres
Todos iguales, inconsolable

Cadenas que me

Translation:

I retired my heart
And never thought
I could once again dream
What good is it to love
When in the end
All that's left is pain

Long nights passed
Without anyone to console me
My destiny changed when I found you
I learned from my mistakes

It's because you came
Right out of my gray skies
That I no longer feel pain
You broke the chains of fear
That held me down
You commuted my sentence

I had almost lost all hope
Because the abyss I had fallen into was so great
I felt I was drowning
Happiness was unattainable
Lost in a sea of beings
Everyone the same, inconsolable

It's because you came
Right out of my gray skies
That I no longer feel pain
You broke the chains of fear
That held me down
You commuted my sentence

If I have you
I can feel beautiful emotions
You are the light of the moon
Your love heals me
Your love fills me

Chorus:
I have you
I am not afraid if you are near me
You are the light of the moon
Your love heals me
Your love reaches me
(Yes, I have you, I take you with me)
(Yes, I have you, I take you with me)
(Oh my love, oh my love)

If I have you

(Chorus)

(I have you, I have you)
A rose fell from the sky
(I have you)
Painted in different colors
(I have you)
In it's heart is said
You are the love of my life

(Yes, I have you
And I take you deep inside me)

I have you

Three drops of holy water
And your whole future will clear up
You'll never be without work

That the world progresses
And we have medicine, computers

You don't need aspirin

And some herbs all take away your nightmares

So you don't have spasms
And never feel envy

So the boy next door
Will give you the time of day

",Tres Gotas de Agua Bendita
Gloria Estefan,"I got no love in me
Guess who's to blame
It's a crying shame
Well it's all because of you
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh
I got no love in me
It's a mystery
How I just couldn't see
You dogged me long enough
Left me dry but I'm tough
I got no love in me

You ask me who to blame
Well it's only you
You ask me who I trust
Well it's me that's who
Baby it's true
You hurt me so much
You're all I ever knew

I knew it when I looked
Into your eyes
I should have known then
I should have realized
All of your lies
Baby did not amount to love

Just remember one thing
What goes around comes around
And what you did to me
One day I'll make you see baby

I got no love in me
Guess who's to blame
It's a crying shame
Well it's all because of you
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh, oh
I got no love in me
It's a mystery
How I just couldn't see
You dogged me long enough
Left me dry but I'm tough
I got no love in me

Bet you couldn't tell, bet you didn't know
You're the only man I really loved
Every single kiss, every time we touched
Imagined what you missed

Imagine now baby how's it gonna be
What you gonna do when you didn't have me
Whatcha gonna do when it's not real
And how's it gonna feel

Deep inside of me
I hope you find what makes you happy
Baby now that you're free
This is all that's left of me, baby

I got no love in me
Guess who's to blame
It's a crying shame
Well it's all because of you
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh

You and I will just succumb to this romance
On that day my love will find you
And you'll discover what a wonder life can be
And you will know how much I love you

If we were lovers
If we were more than just good friends
I know how good it could be
Just by the way you're looking at me

As if we were lovers, if we were lovers
I've waited so long for that day
I think you feel the same way
You try so hard not to give it away

Afraid that I'll discover
What in your heart you know, is meant to be
Darlin' if you want it to be me
To be the one to say, I want you

Then I'm telling you now
Gonna find a way somehow, to be your lover (be your lover)
And spend the whole night making love (making love)
Then find it's never enough

Just think what we are giving up
Every day that we're not lovers
Few times in our lives can we feel this way

It would be a shame just to throw it away
Time is slipping by, we don't know what's ahead
I don't want to look back and have any regrets

One day soon, it's gonna happen just by chance
You and I will just succumb to this romance
On that day my love will find you

Never knowing what I would find
Out of a dream into my life
Must've done something right this time

I don't know where all of this came from
But I think I wanna get me some
Did it happen when I looked away
In just one day

Suddenly you fell from up above
And before I knew it, I found love
Got lost on the way
But I want to stay

I just want to let you know tonight
(All right)
I can't sleep with all this on my mind
Can you make it right

Out of nowhere without a sign
Never knowing what I would find
Out of a dream into my life
Must've done something right this time

We can settle this in just one kiss
Then we'll think of how to deal with this
All the time it was in my best friend
Didn't know it then

But I'm ready for the consequence
Didn't know this could be so intense
Can't take it much longer
This could change today

I just want to let you know tonight

You've got to listen to the beat
Come on shake your body baby do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you tryied it do that conga beat
Feel the fire of desire as you dance the night away
'cause tonight we're gonna party till we see the break of day

Better get yourself together and hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system there's no way you're gonna stop

Gloria Estefan,"Here I am before you naked in your eyes
Hoping with each kiss you will never see through my disguise
I have been made to believe that no one could love me for me
The good and the bad first to the last
No matter the cost, no matter the past

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
Your heart makes the truth what you want to believe
Passion turns pain into ecstasy
You can't walk away from love

Loving you more than I do myself
Revealing the things I would never tell
Daring to risk even life itself
You can't walk away from love

There will be no other lips against my skin
No need to regret, how can pleasure ever be a sin?
I tried to make you believe you meant almost nothing to me
Through all the lies chasing a dream
Finding at last the woman in me

Your eyes only see what they wanna see
Your heart makes the truth what you want to believe
Passion turns pain into ecstasy
You can't walk away from love

Loving you more than I do myself
Revealing the things I would never tell
Daring to risk even life itself

Gloria Estefan,"Some spend their time in conversation
They just talk and talk all day
But there's a sweeter situation, and
It's just a touch away
One kiss can say all that we need to say
Don't have to tell me you care
The message gets through
With the things you're doing
When we're alone in the dark, you speak
To my soul, talk to my heart

In the language of love, we say everything
Every time that we touch we say so much
In the language of love, nothing says it better
Than when we're talking together
Touch by touch in the language of love
In the language of love

This love don't need no explanation
We understand just fine, oh baby
Got heart to heart communication
I tell ya that's the sweetest kind
I love the way your body talks to mine
You can just look in my eyes to know that it's
Real 'cause we go by feeling
We don't need words to express what's in our hearts we say it best
",Language of Love
Gloria Estefan,"I know I let you in
I let down my defenses momentarily
At this moment of my life to be surprised
With feelings I can never satisfy

The words you wrote would free
My carefully protected vulnerability
Doesn't matter that both wear a disguise
We can read the truth between the lines

Dangerous game
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow
I'd be a fool to keep this alive
When I know this can't go anywhere

You know you let me in
You lost your self control to curiosity
Took the bait, I should have never lit the spark
Answering your questions in the dark

Dangerous game
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow
I'd be a fool to keep this alive
When I know this can't go anywhere

Who's the one to blame when things begin to fall apart
Never mind I should have known much better than to even start
How did you make it over all the walls I build so high
Believing all you had to do was try

Gloria Estefan,"What in this world, feels so alive
Makes us, then breaks us, then helps us survive
Buries our hopes, then revives our desire to succeed
We're all greed

Who in this world sees when I cry
Throws me, then shows me that I'm justified
Measure my worth, then decide that I'm not what they need
They've agreed

Where in this world can I hide?
Where can I find someone
That sees me inside to confide

How in this world can I go on
Wondering if you'll think of me when I'm gone?
Shielding my eyes from the pitiless light of the glare
Should you care?

When in this world is it enough?
I never thought it could be quite this rough
Living my life as if millions of people don't stare
They're not there

Why should I have to defend or derive
Most of the rules of the game, I've defied
Though it's been hard on my pride
It's been one hell of a ride

An innocent streak.

Makin? me stronger each time you think I?ve been beat.
Whatever you scatter , you reap.

But doubt(?)me,

Defeat me, shame and mistreat me.
All that I wish you is love.

Despise me, lie, criticize me,

Figure out the reasons that you stopped believing
Save me your caresses
Go clear up the confusion that your face confesses
Travel around the sun

Chorus:
And in the meantime
Call me only with your silence
Leave me stranded on this island
Go without me on your pillow, on your skin
And in the meantime
Disbelieve in your suspicions
Reconsider your position, your desires
On your lips only my name that you will whisper
Then remember
Take all the time that you need
IÂ'll be waiting every moment
In the meantime

Take a little breather
Perhaps you think, in love, the grass is always greener
Set free your excesses
I hope you find the courage that your faith professes
To travel Â'round the sun

And when my teardrops
Melt away within your laughter
Till you find what you are after
If our paths cross down the line
Just pretend that you donÂ't see me
That IÂ'm new to your existence
If weÂ're meant to go the distance
ThereÂ's no test we canÂ't survive

Underneath the urgency where there's nothing but time

Into a rising undertow

Crashin' through your veins

What you want, I know
What you need

I think you need a little push in my direction

And I will catch you when you fall

So afraid that once inside

Where he's been sleeping
To keep himself from weeping
He gets up and goes on his way

And barely misses
She curses his existence
Leans on the horn and goes on her way

Living worlds apart
What could they ever have in common?
Started life with so much promise
Different choices on the way

Feeling desolate and distant
Losing hope with every instant
If there's happiness, they've missed it
In this endless game

We are of one name, one name
We are of one name
We want the same things
We need the same things

We are of one name, one name
We are of one name

Wishes he'd been there for his children
He prays that they'll forgive him
But the words are still hard to say

His daughter feel regret
For choosing work over a family
She wanted one so badly
For very choice there's a price to pay

Grown so far apart
They should have everything in common
Started out with so much promise
Different choices on the way

She just needed his attention
He had no time for affection
Now they're struggling for redemption
Knowing they're to blame

I've seen a lot of pain oh, oh, oh, to finally realize
The reason for this life

Is to say goodbye to sorrow
Don't hang on to the tears we borrow
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel
That we are so free, we are free

I've seen the bottom once or twice
I've soared above the earth as suddenly
I've made a few mistakes, it's true
I've seen enough of hate, oh, oh, oh, to finally realize
There's not much more to life

Than to say goodbye to sorrow
Don't hold on to the fears we borrow
Say goodbye to sorrow and feel
We are so free, we are free

We may long for happiness
Pray to God that we be blessed
Save us from this loneliness

After all that I've been through

Is to look inside of you

Because time waits for no one
And tomorrow just may not come 'round
Because time waits for no one

Time, it's seamless illusion seduced me
Time, to show me the ropes
Enticed me
To waste it

But truth is much better seen
Within our dreams

Unraveling then starting again

I'll live like forever is now
Because time waits for no one
And tomorrow just may not come 'round
Because time waits for no one

why no aprobechan las horas

No nos alcanza la noche
ni mucho menos el dia
si al final todo el amor 
se vuele en tierras why en cenizas

Amor sin tin nada es igual
sin tu cuerpo ni tus ganas
ni la eterna luz de tu mirar
Ay no dejes el tiempo pasar
que el beso que no te he dado
quiza nunca te lo vuelva a dar

solo preocupate de hoy
why solo de este momento
que quizas no habra una maÃ±ana
why darte todo lo que siento
a los heroes en la vida
su memoria lleva el viento
pero nunca nuestro amor 
que crecera mas con el tiempo

Ay, ay, ay Amor (Hoooo)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (tan solo preocupate de hoy)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (en la vida todo puede cambiar)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (el tiempo no nos va a esperar)
Ay, ay, ay Amor

Si yo pudiera explicarte
que de ti no es suficiente
why cuando la noche acaba
Quiero amarte nuevamente
porque tanto preocuparnos
de tanta contradiccion why envidias 
si al final tu cuerpo 
se convertira solo en cenizas

Amor sin tin nada es igual
sin tu cuerpo ni tus ganas
ni la eterna luz de tu mirar
Ay no dejes el tiempo pasar
que el beso que no te he dado
quiza nunca te lo vuelva a dar

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

solo preocupate de hoy
why solo de este momento
que quizas no habra una maÃ±ana
why darte todo lo que siento
a los heroes en la vida
su memoria lleva el viento
pero nunca nuestro amor 
que crecera mas con el tiempo

Ay, ay, ay Amor (Ay, ay, ay Amor)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (tan solo preocupate de hoy)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (Que el tiempo no nos va a esperar)
Ay, ay, ay Amor (Ay, ay, ay Amor)

Why pon en la balanza el corazón en frio
Guárdame un abrazo
Why tus pupilas para no perderte el paso
Dale la vuelta la sol

why mientras tanto, háblame con tu silencio
Why reemplázame en tus celos
Sacrifícame en tu almohada why en tu piel
Why mientras tanto equivócate en tu duda

why en tu cama ponle cura a tus instintos
Why a tu voz ponle mi nombre, que murmuras
Why se esconde, tómate un tiempo mi amor
Qe yo viviré esperando, mientras tanto

Tómate un respiro
Deja que nuestras piedras se las lleve el río
Guárdame un atajo
Si vas en precipicio no mires abajo
Dale la vuelta al sol

why mis lamentos, se confundan con tus risas
Pues tu amor no tiene prisa
Si te encuentro en plena calle, imagina que no existo
Que soy nueva en tu vereda, que si pasas esa prueba
No habrá pena que nos calle

Gloria Estefan,"I remember days, nights were never cold
I had you in my life, I had you here to hold
And I remember love warm as a summer day
But I lost you and I lost my way
Now I'm in the rain begging you please, please

Baby, won't you show me the way back to your heart?
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms

Lead me back

Every night another lonely street I walk down alone
Searching for a light, your light to lead me home
Leave a candle in the window and let it shine for me
Take my hand and take these tears away
I can't take the pain, I'm on my knees, please

Baby, won't you show me the way back to your heart?
Let me see a sign to know if I'm close or far
Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms

Take my hand and take me in your arms
I'm out in the dark
Down on my knees, please

Show me the way back to your heart

Lead me back to the road that leads back to your arms
To your arms, to your arms",Show Me the Way Back to Your Heart
Gloria Estefan,"When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody know it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours I know you will be mine
Party time, party time, party time, party time

All day the world goes round round
You can feel the changes coming down
It doesn't matter who you are
With love to give you will go far

We see the treasures all around
And burn ourselves into the ground
Everyone's trying to survive
We're not just born to be alive

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Every road I follow is leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours I know you will be mine
Party time, party time, party time, party time

We live our lives in mystery
While everything is meant to be
No reason here to wonder why
All that we seek is in the sky

You are the one that I want to hold
I feel you deep inside my soul
Only our love will set us free
This night belongs to you and me

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Evey road I follow is leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours I know you will be mine
Party time, party time, party time

I know
You know
Evey road I follow is leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky

La vida nunca es facil pero se a donde voy
Siempre llena de preguntas asi es como soy
Pase cada momento buscando algo en que creer

Desde la oscuridad veo el sol de un nuevo dia
Naciendo en mi
Desde la oscuridad el amor me a salvado
Ha sido de ti

Vuelvo a empezar de nuevo otra vez
Con tu mano en la mia mas fuerte estare
Quizas mi paso es lento pero yo llegare
Caminemos juntos quiero compartir
El milagro que has hecho en mi

Desde la oscuridad veo el sol de un nuevo dia
Naciendo en mi
Desde la oscuridad el amor me a salvado
Ha sido de ti

Por siempre, por siempre me aferro a la luz de tu amor
Por siempre, por siempre me aferro a la luz
Por siempre, por siempre me aferro a la luz de tu amor

Can be like destiny
There's no way to say forever

Is like the blowing wind
It can take us to wherever

Gloria Estefan,"To be completely honest
It scares me to imagine
What life would be without you

And for this very reason
I ask you to forgive me
For what I'm putting us through

Although there are so many things
Against us, I've decided
That I'm not giving you up, no

Thinking back, I see what we have
Is something different
I think we've known all along
So how fair would it be
To divide this love's existence
Between what's right and what's wrong

And you, always wondering if we'll make it
Time will tell you
That I'm not giving you up, no, no

We'll find a way to be together
However long it takes, wherever
If it means having you for only a moment
A moment just might be enough
I'm not giving you up, no
No I'm not giving you up, no

Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken
Come back to haunt me, false and broken
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever
Searching for water in the desert

No, I refuse to have to do
Without your kisses
I'm not giving you up, no, no
No, I'm not giving you up, no

Not giving you up",I'm Not Giving You Up

While you are somewhere dreaming

I, I feel so happy by your side
Oh why, I, wonder, wonder, wonder why
Find it hard to find the words 
To say what I am feeling

I'm so in love, I'm so alive 
And I know you're the reason, why
Why I'm so happy all the time
Oh why, I, wonder, wonder, wonder why

I need nothing else in live than to hold you
I, oh , I am in so deep I don't need no sleep
I just need you here with me

Baby, I live for loving you
(Ooh, la la la la la)
Live for loving you, all I wanna do 
Is love you, love you

It would never cross my mind to find another lover
'Cause after having been with you, 
There could be no other
I, just touching you I'm satisfied
Oh why, I, wonder, wonder, wonder why

I need nothing else in live than to hold you
I, oh , I am in so deep I don't need no sleep
I just need you here with me

Baby, I live for loving you
(Ooh, la la la la la)
Live for loving you, all I wanna do 
Is love you, I love you, I love you (love you)

I, wonder, wonder, wonder why

I love you, love you

Baby, I live for loving you
(Ooh, la la la la la)
I live for loving you, all I wanna do 
All I wanna do Is love you, love you

No me importa el qué dirán
Ni lo que estarán pensando
Ni lo que van a pensar

A la corta why a la larga
Lo que digan me da igual
No quiero vivir la vida
Al compás de los demás

Yo sigo mi propio rumbo
Rechazo conformidad
Viviendo muy bien la vida
Sin mirar jamás atrás

Sembrando mi andar de flores
Busco la felicidad
Haciendo lo que me gusta
Sin herir a nadie más

Si yo digo que algo es blanco
Dicen negro está mejor
De cada cosa que hago
Todos tienen su opinión

why no hay forma de aplacarlos
Es mi franca conclusión
Prefiero seguir el paso
Que me dicte el corazón

Conozco mejor que nadie
Lo que me va a hacer feliz
Que en cuestiones de la vida
Ya no soy una aprendiz

Bailar cada vez que pueda
Es lo que yo decidí
Disfrutando del momento
Desde el día en que nací

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Que bailando se van las penas
Que agobain el corazón, tú ves

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Si temprano te acuestas
No siempre va a amanecer
Por eso sigue rumbeando de buena fe

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Para bien o para mal
Lo que digan ya a mi me de igual

A bailar la vida es para gozar
El que vive siempre criticando
Hay que lástima me da
Yo le digo
A bailar la vida es para gozar

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás
Yo sé que disfrutarás

Si tú no bailas, no gozas
Si tú no bailas, no gozos ná

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás
Esos que viven del cuento
Mira de rumba no saben ná

Si tú no bailas, no gozas
Se goza más,
Tú versa

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás

Gloria Estefan,"Por mucho tiempo hay algo que quiero decirte
Estoy sintiendo tu corazón alejado why falso
Why tus palabras aunque van a herir mis sentimientos
Ya no debes callarlas más 
Que me causen sufrimiento
Lo tengo que enfrentar

Tú siempre has sido la alegría de mi vida
Pero ahora siento que cada día estés más distante
Why ante tierra entrar tu corazón de mi alma quiero saber
Si tú al fin tú ya has dejado de amarme

Pero en tu cara de alguien te has enamorado
No tengas pena, nadie se muere de un desengaño
No necesito que te quedes si ya no me quieres
El destino me llevara a encontrar otro camino a la felicidad.

Ti siempre has sido la alegría de mi vida
Pero ahora veo que no te sientes como antes
Tengo que arrancar tu corazón de mi alma
Como la flor que tu me diste un día why se fue marchitando

Chorus:
Lo nuestro no tiene solución, tengo que resignarme
Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Gloria entre coros:
Recordaras todas mis caricias, cada uno de mis besos
Muchos amores tendrás pero no vas a olvidarme jamás

Lo nuestro no tiene solución, tengo que resignarme
Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Yo ya lo nuestro se acabo
Aunque me cause dolor, aunque me rompa el corazón 

Nunca me veras llorando, no voy a darte la satisfacción 
No hay vuelta atrás no hay solución
No, no por mucho tiempo sueñas con otra 

Otra queme robo la calma, que robo mi corazón
Que me ha clavado en mi alma el dolor 
Puedes rogarme, puedes rogarme
Pero tú tardaras en olvidarme

Toda la triste verdad que esta escrita allí en tus ojos
Ten el valor why dilo ya
Que de tus labios lo quiero escuchar
No, no, no, no tiene solución pero tú tardaras en olvidarme
Lo nuestro no tiene solución pero tu tardaras en olvidarme

Habia un cuaderno de escual
Why la sopresa fue grande
Al ver que era de mi abuela.
Habian poemas de amor
Why con lujo de detalle.
Pero lo que mas me cautivo
Fueron todos sus refranes

Amor why fortuna(Resistencia ninguna)
A cada pajarillo(Le gusta su nidillo)
A caras honradas(No encuantra puerta cerrada)
A cualquier dolencia(El remedio es la paciencia)
A casa de ti tia(Entrada por salida)
A la cena why la cama(Una vez se llama)
No por mucho madrugar,
Amanece mas temprano.

Seguia leyendo con calma.
La tinta estaba borrosa.
Quien creyyera que la Abuela
Desde joven tan jocosa.
Voy a seguir sus consejos
Antes de que sea muy tarde.
Bendicion a to' los viejos
Why a mi abuela dios la guarde.

En el pais del ciego(El tuerto es el rey)
La cabra siempre busca(Pal' monte)
En casa de herrero(Cuchillo de palo)
A padre ahorrador(Hijo gastador)
A quien le dan el pie(Se toma la mano)
Al que le duele una muel(Que la eche fuera)
Aquel amor viejo(Ni lo olvido ni lo dejo)
No por mucho madrugar,
Amanece mas temprano

A falta de mano(Bueno son los pies)
A buen capellan(Mejor sacristan)
El ojo del amo(Engorda al caballo)
Al que mucho tiene(MAs le viene)
Agua corriente(Sana a la gente)
Barco en varadero(No gana dinero)
Amor por interes(Se acaba en un dos por tres)
No por mucho madrugar,
Amanece mas temprano.

Espero tomes consejo

Pa' que tu llegues a viejo.

Sabes que te sueño, como la primera noche

Eres parte de mi ser

Sabes que te anhelo
Cuando no te tengo why no estás a mi lado

Gloria Estefan,"There's a part of me that's dying, every time I hear your name
There's a part of me that's trying, to bring back your love again
There are times when I just want to run, but there's no place to hide
Even though my heart is breaking in a million bits inside
I can make believe that none of this is true

But I can't forget you, can't break free
I have only got myself to blame
Nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see? We can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

There are nights when I lay wide awake
Thinking of how good it could be
Other nights I don't feel worthy, of the love you gave to me
I remember not too long ago, we were both here to stay
But it seems it happened overnight, when I threw it all away
I can walk away and find somebody new

But I can't forget you, can't break free
Only got myself to blame
Nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see? We can find tomorrow what we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

Hope that I can make you love me once again
'Cause I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you

Dos, she's beginning her life on her own
Brand new place but she don't have a phone

Is her freedom

My front door, the corner store
Climbin' the tree in my old backyard
My mother's smile from ear to ear
When I got all A's on my report card
I can see them all when I close my eyes

Caressing my day dreams
You're here by my side
I feel life smile above me
Whenever your sweet eyes
Can look into mine

And it's my consolation
The sound of your laughter
Like music sublime
There's no way of concealing
Every thought, every feeling

The day you say you love me
The most beautiful of roses
Will bloom in every garden
Of a color never seen

And from the highest steeple
The bells will sing our love song
And make the eager fountain
Spill over with our love

The night you say you love me
The skies above will listen
The jealous stars will longing
Will see us passing by

A playful ray of moonlight
Will dance along of pleasure
While witnessing this moment of our lives
We will always treasure

It felt so good to hear

His love was so doggone good

Super cool dude cross the room diggin' on me
I tried to pretend like I didn't even see him

He took my hand and started to dancin'
I know he felt me fallin' for him

Gloria Gaynor,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune!
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon!

It's where you are

Somewhere there's heaven
How near
How far!

Until you will
How still my aching heart

Were the windows of my soul

And I start to cry each time we leave
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry, ooh baby,
Walk on by, ooh darling
Please, walk on by,
I don't want to you to see me cry
Walk on by, please, please

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands

This time might be the last time I fear
Unless I make it all so clear
I need you so

We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other
Different pages from the same story

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right

This aching is familiar
It's something I remember
We can't touch without feeling
Can't heal without healing

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
I need you so

Only the young could fall so hard
Can be so careless, and ignorance costs

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Let us in

So you've moved out of the way this time
Making room for each other
One without the other
We are broken but we are moving still

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other

You got to learn to fly, learn to live that love so free

Why do we lose so many tears?

Always the same theme
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on

And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to me
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just don't care
Everytime you go away

Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

Gloria Gaynor,"The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it?s sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feed, it might make you sad
Next time you feed, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go round

And it don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you

And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love, can you feel it?

It don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of

Gloria Gaynor,"Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ah, ah

Should have known better

I feel so unsure
As you take your hand and lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And you're its sad goodbye

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh oh

Time can never mend

To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth

I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We've hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But no, who's gonna dance with me?
Please, please dance

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you

If we can't solve any problems
And why do we lose so many tears?
Oh
So you go again when the leading man appears.
Always the same theme
Can't you see
We've got ev'rything going on and on and on.
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see.
I can feel your body move
Does it mean that much to me.
I can't go on singing the same theme
Cause can't you see
We've got ev'rything
Baby
Even though you know:
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.

Can't go on singing the same theme
Cause baby
Can't you see
We've got ev'rything going on and on and on.
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.
Ev'ry time you go away you take a piece of me with you.

They say they've never seen me so happy
But that's a secret between you and me
They don't know nothing about us baby

Can't tell anybody that you're not from around here
They don't know that you're an angel

Wanted to leave yeah, just walk away

Well so afraid of being sad and blue
Talked to myself and said I'm over you

You make me happy and I'm gonna stay
Whenever life was getting out of hand
I turned to you and you would understand

I got my feet back on solid ground
You make me smile when I wanna cry
I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die

How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run
And we?ll have some fun now
Before I melt away?

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler, ""Stop""

Oh, Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go

Gloria Gaynor,"God rest you merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our heavenly father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of god by name

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not"", then said the angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of virtue, power, and might
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite""

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm, and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
This blessed babe to find

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface

O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

Gloria Gaynor,"Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still good-bying
As long as you love me so

He's sitting by the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold
And the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Ooh, wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry
When he's nice and warm?

And the lights turned low

Gloria Gaynor,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in they dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

O morning starts together
Proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth",Little Town of Bethlehem
Gloria Gaynor,"Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.",O Holy Night
Gloria Gaynor,"Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking
In a winter wonderland

Gone away
Is the bluebird
Here to stay
Is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking
In a winter wonderland

In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down

When it's cold
Ain't it thrilling
When your nose
Gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play

Gloria Gaynor,"I feel so unsure,
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind a silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have done my rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better then to cheat a friend,
And waste a chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again.
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend.
To the heart and mind
If your answer's kind
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is all you find.

[Chorus]

What am I without your love?

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way
We've hurt each other with the things we want to say.
We could have been so good together
We could have lived forever
But no, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.

[Chorus]

Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?",Careless Whisper [DVD]

Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song 

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on 

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song

I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
But this time before you run to her

I've even seen her
Maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms
And rush of to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever
