Perry Como,"What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit,
Lovely as ever I must admit.

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then,
Gee but it's nice to see you again!

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you,
But seeing you is grand,
And you were sweet to offer your hand.
I understand.

Adieu!
Pardon my asking what's new,
Of course, you couldn't know,
I haven't changed,
I still love you so!

Of course, you couldn't know,
I haven't changed, I still love you so,
I still love you so!",What's New?
Perry Como,"When I need you, 
I just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you, 
It's only a heartbeat away! 
 
When I need love, 
I hold out my hands and I touch love 
I never knew there was so much love 
Keeping me warm night an' day! 
 
A thousand miles of empty space in between us 
A telephone can take the place of your smile 
But you know I won't be travellin' forever 
It's cold out, but hold out an do like I do! 
 
When I need you, 
I just close my eyes and I'm with you 
And all that I so want to give you, 
It's only a heartbeat away! 
 
It's not easy when the road is goodbye, love! (goodbye, love!) 
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bare! 
 
But you know I won't be travellin' a lifetime! 
It's cold out, but hold out 
An do like I do! 
 
When I need love,

Perry Como,"You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 
I feel like this is the beginning

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

Perry Como,"( This is the story of Lili Marlene, 
doo, doo, doo doo, doo! ) 
 
Would you like to hear the story, 
of a girl that many soldiers know? 
It's a tale of love in all it's glory, 
they tell when the lights are soft an' low! 
 
Underneath the lamp post by the brigades 
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
she waits for a boy who marched away 
and though he's gone, she hears him say: 
 
""Oh promise you'll be true, 
fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till I return to you, 
fare thee well Lili Marlene! "" 
 
( This is the story of Lili Marlene! ) 
With a kiss she gave her promise, 
to be constant as the stars above, 
every soldier knows she's kept her promise, 
and she has been faithful to her love! 
 
( Underneath the lamp post by the brigade 
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
for this is the place a vow was made 
and breezes sing her serenade . . . ) 
 
""Oh promise you'll be true, 
fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till I return to you, 
fare thee well Lili Marlene, "" 
 
( This is the story of Lili Marlene! 
Though wee stems have an ending, 
no one knows just what the end will be 
but tonight when twilight is descending, 
if you'll come along, here's what you'll see . . . ) 
 
Underneath the lamp post by the brigade 
standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
and as they go marching to the fray 
the soldiers all salute and say: 
 
We'll tell him you've been true, 
fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till he returns to you, 
fare thee well . . .

Perry Como,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I met some other people same story as mine
Laughin' and drinkin' waitin' for the sun to go down
We had life in our eyes as we crossed the border line
Shot six good men without tellin' them why
How could anybody steal the only thing a man has left

Perry Como,"Dreams and memories, 
Are all that you've left me, 
Only lonely thoughts, 
About the one I worship and adore! 

Dreams and memories, 
Are what I must live with, 
Sad remembering, 
Of golden moments that exist no more! 

Lovin' arms to hold me tight, 
And your lips to kiss goodnight, 
A love that seemed "" Oh so right!"" 
And yet, somehow, went wrong! 

Dreams and memories, 
The moonlight on your hair, 
Songs that we sang, 
That feeling we shared whenever a church bell rang! 

Oh, the memories and dreams of you!

A laughing you and I, alone.

A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.
It all comes back to me now, 
The love I threw away,
And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now

Perry Como,"Where do I begin ?
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet, love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?

With her first hello
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There?d never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels? songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely

With her along, who could be lonely ?
I reach for her hand, it?s always there

How long does it last ?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day ?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I?ll need her till the stars all burn away
And she?ll be there, she?ll be there

Are always in sight, 
The stars are the flowers 
That bloom in the night! 

And sure as there's heaven 
You'll find that it's true 
When you're in love, 
Those stars above, are blooming

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Down in Nualo, Laredo, 
on the border of ol' Mexico 
there's a legend they tell of a cowboy, 
a tall Texas drover named ""Joe"" 
but the braseros just call him ""Gringo"", 
the gringo who played the guitar 
to the Mexican girl that he loved so, 
'neath the misty Mexico star

when the round-up was over an' through 
and great were the plans for their wedding,

Perry Como,"Love is like a never ending melody, 
Poets have compared it to a symphony, 
A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon, 
But our song of love is slightly out of tune . . . . 

Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch, 
Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich, 
Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing, 
Like the bossa nova love should swing . . . . 

We used to harmonize two souls in perfect time, 
Now the song is different and the words don't even rhyme, 
'Cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon, 
What good's a heart that's slightly out of tune? 

Tune your heart with mine the way it used to be, 
Join with me in harmony and sing a song of love, 
We're bound to get in tune again before too long, 
There'll be no Desafinado when your heart belongs to me completely 
Then you won't be slightly out of tune, you'll sing along with me!

That special one we said good-bye and cried to,
Because they righted all the wrongs,
These are the songs i love!

The happy time when we found spring together.
The pretty themes, that underscored the pretty dreams,

Perry Como,"Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go","Some Enchanted Evening,"
Perry Como,"They say that falling in love is wonderful 
It's wonderful, so they say 
And with the moon up above 
It's wonderful, it's wonderful, so they tell me!

I only know they tell me that love is grand, and 
The thing that's known as romance is wonderful 
Wonderful, in every way, so they say!",They Say It’s Wonderful
Perry Danos,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Y pensar que en mi vida fuiste flama
y el caudal de mi gloria fuiste tú
y llegué a quererte con el alma
y hoy me mata de tristeza tu actitud

Y a qué debo dime entonces tu abandono
y en qué ruta tu promesa se perdió
y si dices la verdad yo te perdono
y te llevo en mi recuerdo junto a Dios

Pesado,"Me dijiste tantas veces
Que me amabas
Y encendiste en mí la chispa de amor
Y hoy me dices que te vas

Que ya nunca volverás
Que estas cansada de todo
Que este adiós para los
Dos es lo mejor

Que de pronto una ilusión
Llego a tu mente
Intentaste hacerte fuerte
Y sin razón

Pues ya no me quieres más
Y por eso ahora te vas
Con el dueño de tus sueños
Esos sueños que ahora se hacen realidad

Dime si haya encontrarte
La felicidad
Si aquel ardiente placer
También el te lo da

Dime si haya te dan
El verdadero amor
Si eres capaz de entregarte
Sin una condición
Y te vas

Presiento que te estoy perdiendo
Di que sólo es un mal sueño
Y ven para olvidar mis dudas

Amor me da miedo verte indiferente
No puedo creer que esté todo acabado
Adivino el final en tus ojos ausentes
Y en todos los besos que ayer olvidamos

Amor déjame quedarme en tu vida
Con una despedida no resuelves nada
Si te hice sufrir curaré tus heridas
Yo no sé soñar si tus madrugadas

Y cuando te busco y no estás
La desolación
Se queda grabada
En mi piel y en mi corazón

No comprendo esta locura

Nuestro amor no aceptarían
Sin pensar cual fuera el daño
Te alejaron de mi vida
Nunca olvido que llorando
Prometiste que algún día volverías

Me fume tres mil cigarros
Mil botellas de esperanza

Con un nudo en la garganta
Ya cambie diez calendarios
Esperando tu llegada
Pero nada, de ti nada

No, lo nuestro no puede morirse, no
El tiempo no me hará rendirme y
Mientras respire aquí te esperare

Loco, no me importa que me llamen loco
Cuando al acariciar tu foto
Lloro y les hablo de ti

Loco, resucitando la ilusión perdida
Sé que muy pronto sanara la herida
Que me dejaste aquella noche fría

Pesado,"Llegaste en el momento que mi corazon 
Estaba desahuciado en cosas del amor

Estaba en pie de guerra contra la razón

Cruzamos las miradas y todo cambio 
Un beso puso fin a mi revolución 
Por ti reabrí las puertas de mi corazon 
Y ahora nuevamente creo en el amor 

Gracias a ti han vuelto en mi las ganas de vivir
Y no me cansare de repetir que todo te lo debo a ti 
Por ti sanaron mis heridas, he vuelto a ver la luz del día
Y he pisado el cielo en cada beso que me das 
Hoy tengo fantasías que se hacen realidad 
Cuando la magia de tus manos me acaricia en la intimidad

Pesado,"Año del 71
El mes de Octubre corría
En Reynosa Tamaulipas

Al despuntar nuevo día
Hirieron a Chito Cano
No se sabe quien seria

Qué bonitos son los hombres
No se les puede negar
Aun después de caído

Tuvo la fuerza de hablar
No corran no sean cobardes
Acábenme de matar

Con un balazo en la espalda
El todavía se reía
No los creía tan cobardes

Hampones o policías
Me pegaron por la espalda
De frente no se podía

Se presento Chon Garcia
A hablar con la judicial
Para que maten a chito

Trabajo les ha de dar
Nomás sálganle al camino
Sombreros han de sobrar

De Reynosa a Matamoros
De Monterrey a Laredo
Anden con mucho cuidado

Agentes y pistoleros
Todavía soy Chito Cano
Y todavía no me muero

Ya con esta me despido
Sin agravio ni rencores
Lo que se presta, se paga

Tengan presente señores
Si al cielo avientas la daga
Va en busca de los traidores

",Chito Cano
Pesado,"La nieve estaba cayendo, los pinos se congelaban
En el risco del madroño unas armas apuntaban
Sólo las brumas de nieve aquellas miras nublaban

Se oyó mugir un novillo, que venía con la manada
Y los cascos del caballo del señor que las arriaba
Ramiro dejo la bestia mientras el risco rodeaba

El caballo era un criollito pero muy bien arrendado
Por eso sin su jinete supo rialar el ganado
Ramiro estaba orgulloso de su requinto dosalbo

Les dijo Ramiro Sierra, aquí no se engaña a nadie
Yo solo vine a cobrarles la muerte de mi compadre
Y a recoger el ganado que le robaron cobardes

Eran 600 novillos, también ganado lechero
Por eso lo codiciaban esos malditos cuatreros
Mas no sabían que Ramiro, les iba a rajar el cuero

Calibre 2.23 que bonito cacareabas
Se confundían los quejidos con el mugir de las vacas
Y los ecos de la sierra estaba a la grababa

Adiós requinto dosalbo siempre serás el primero
Ya murió Don Pablo Chávez aquel rico ganadero
Ojala y allá en el cielo sigas herrando becerros

",Ramiro Sierra
Pesado,"Salieron de madrugada
Se oía el canto de los gallos
Iban a ser dos jornadas

A lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba
En el rancho del pitayo

Su padre les dio un consejo
Cuando a partir se aprestan
Cuiden muy bien el pellejo

Porque la vida se acaba
En las palabras del viejo
Los tres hermanos pensaban

Pedro le dice a Fabián
Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal

Pa que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomás llegar
Nos vamos a divertir

Cuando arribaron al baile
A bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire

Ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre
Cuando del rancho salieron

Eran muchos los rivales
Viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales

Abrieron todo el fuego
Así matan los cobardes
Cuando los acosa el miedo

Un viejito solitario
Sin esperanza ninguna
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos

Como toda su fortuna
Va al panteón de vez en cuando
A visitar las tres tumbas

Ya no sigas me dijo llorando

Esta canción sale de lo mas profundo de mi corazón

Drive away the oxygen
Choking in the gas we self produced

The more we breathe, the sooner we die
Climates change, oceans vaporize
Woods becomes deserts;no vegetation
Species of animals exterminated
The earth makes its last rotation

Why give a child its birth
When we are poisoning our earth

Who pays your bills? How come you came this far? 
Shrugged him off, and locked the door

I may be wrong, I thought we said 
It couldn't happen here here

Our dignity and injured innocence 
It contradicts your battle-scars 
Still healed, so far 

Now it almost seems incredible 
We've laughed too loud, and woke up everyone

By the station called King's Cross 
Dead and wounded on either side

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal

Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

And even though I tried, it all fell apart

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said: ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

Phone up a friend, who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea 
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

One day I'll read, or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest
But I don't like to compete, or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal

I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would

Pick up a brochure about the sun
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw
I was always told that you should join a club
Stick with the gang, if you want to belong

I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete, or play out on the street
For in a secret life I was a round head general

I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would
Oh, I would

I was faced with a choice at a difficult age
Would I write a book? Or should I take to the stage?
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet
Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat

It's not a crime when you look the way you do
The way I like to picture you
When I get home, it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight

Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

I could leave you, say goodbye

Pass the test - and don't compete

And takes to the stage in a secret life

Pet Shop Boys,"Another night with open eyes
Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love, and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love, and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughing stock
Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you, and even in bed
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!
(That's childish, so childish!)

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love, and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now: Can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself: Can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Ask yourself now: Can you forgive her

Turn in my sleep, the bad dream is over 
Think of you and shall I ever recover? 

Now, I want to wake up 
How I want to wake up 

I stood at the kitchen-sink, my radio played 
Songs like ""Tainted Love"" and ""Love Is Strange"" 
As I listened and the words hit my ears 
I cried sudden tears

You don't understand it's the glamorous life

To get our fifteen minutes of fame
We have no integrity
We're ready to crawl

Believe me, I'm going to be big
I'm a slave to glamour

Relentlessly tough, for when the going gets rough

It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential
Between you and me

Go on tell me that you love me
Show me you dare
We may not venture out in public
At least I know, you care
It can't be guaranteed
Just as much as you can give of yourself
That's all I need

And I'll keep it confidential
It's secrets, confidential
It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential
Between you and me

Stay secret
So secret

You play some silly games
And if everyone knew about us I'd feel no shame

But I'll keep its confidential
It's secrets, confidential
It may come as some surprise
But I can stay secret from prying eyes
So don't worry, I'll keep this confidential

Should learn for all time how the world is run

Get proper helpings, when we all start carving
What keeps mankind alive, the fact that millions
Are daily tortured, stifled, punished, silenced, oppressed
Mankind can keep alive, thanks to its brilliance
At keeping its humanity repressed
For once, you must not try to shirk the facts
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts

You say the girls may strip with your permission 
You draw the line dividing art from sin

Should learn for all time how the world is run

And you will not forget
Before you find your love

Who loved too much
He ended up inside a prison cell
You've got to want to give to get it
Or you could land up 
In the same suspicious hell
It's happened before, it's happened before
Coincidence and patience
Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here 
Before you find your love
Before it comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
One day when the phone starts ringing

Pet Shop Boys,"Please allow me to try and explain
I'm living proof that man can change
I knew what I wanted
I knew how to get it

It didn't make it happy so I started again
What I wanted to be was a family man 
But nature had some alternative plans
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold 
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told

I want to know yeah
I want to know

But every now and then 
Often at night 
A particular feeling would surface in spite 
Of what I told myself and tried to deny
I kept on asking the question: why?

[Chorus]
I want to know yeah
I want to know
You grow up and experience this 
A total metamorphosis
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

With time and age I had to change 
Cause my behaviour was getting strange
People on the street caught my eye
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy

The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge
Was in retreat and I was on the verge
Of falling in love or having fun
Time was running out
Something had to be done

I want to know yeah
I want to know
I want to know yeah
Tell me what's the reason

Where was I?
Laying down the law
Dancing with others
Out on the floor

Music and smoke
What did it mean?
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I had what I wanted

Madly in love
Nothing else mattered
This was enough
Questions were answered 
Which used to perplex 
In particular those about the big s.e.x.

I want to know yeah
I want to know
I want to know yeah
Tell me what's the reason

You grow up and experience this
A total metamorphosis
It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis

Dreaming is easy
Life is tough
I got the picture
The most important thing 

Is not to end up bitter 
Cause when you start to feel 
Increasingly forlorner 
Woomph! love comes 
Right around the corner

It may not last 
But here am I
Once a caterpillar
Now a butterfly
It can seem strange
But when you reminisce
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

Crowned heads and cardinals under military sway

Give devotion, dedication, celebration
not some cheap charade
and I'll rule the world

because they said 'We don't understand you'

In audience I receive the media's pleas
They kiss my ring in interviews on bended knees
In victory I'm magnanimous and charming when

Into the sun
Pilgrims are singing
Their journey done
I look at my short life and think
Of all the champagne that I drink
With all the faces that I know
And how much further can one go?

And if I decide
To step aside
I will try to reply to the feelings I hide

I look from my window
Down to the square
At workers still queuing
Patiently there
For market forces to provide
What history so far denied
For a different kind of fate
Than to labor long and always wait

And if I decide
To step aside
I will try to return to the person inside

Will I always need you?
Would you want me too?
Can you love me for good?
That way you thought you could?

Or will Spring bring rain and Summer burn
Will tears at last precede the time
From Summer warmth to sudden cold
As certainly as growing old

And if I decide
To step aside
I will try to forget all the tears I'll have cried",To Step Aside [Ralphi's Old School Dub][Mix]

Together tonight
Pour me some wine
Turn off the light
And look at the view from your balcony
London through your eyes
No one but you to keep me company
Twenty floors up a high-rise

In a romance of the old school
If you lived in this tower block
You'd be a victim of the system
A subject for punk rock
But look at the view from your balcony
The sunset is searing the sky
And how proudly you are pointing out to me
London through your eyes

How like a prince in a castle
Viewing dominions below
Telling me now in a whisper
Something I needed to know

Pet Shop Boys,"I get out of bed at half past ten
Phone up a friend, who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea 
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

One day I'll read, or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest
But I don't like to compete, or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal

I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try
And I could
And left to my own devices, I probably would

Pick up a brochure about the sun
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw
I was always told that you should join a club
Stick with the gang, if you want to belong

I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
In a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete, or play out on the street
For in a secret life I was a round head general

I could leave you, say goodbye
Or I could love you, if I try

And left to my own devices, I probably would
Left to my own devices, I probably would

Would I write a book? Or should I take to the stage?

The way I like to picture you
When I get home, it's late at night
I pour a drink and watch the fight

Turn off the TV, look at a book
Pick up the phone, fix some food
Maybe I'll sit up all night and day
Waiting for the minute I hear you say

Pet Shop Boys,"Another night with open eyes
Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love, and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love, and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughing stock
Because you dance to disco, and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you, and even in bed
Said she was gonna go and get herself a real man instead

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish!
(That's childish, so childish!)

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love, and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's bad enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?

When I look back upon my life

I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do

Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to

Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

You're my nation
This is my application
Give me hope
Keep me sane
Give me
Indefinite leave to remain

All the worlds
That I saw
I went so far away
And still wanted you more

It may sound superficial
But can we make it official?
Give me hope
Keep me sane
Give me
Indefinite leave to remain

Tell me where I stand
What do you envision?
One way or another
Give me your decision now

Is it time
To proceed?
Will you give me a chance
And the status I need?

To destroy what was rotten

You'll get over it, I'm on your side because
You'll get over it, and what a ride it was!

He wants to upgrade the mobile you own
Have you realized your computer's a spy?
Give him a ring, he'll explain why

The swooping birds and barking dogs

Money comes and money goes

There's got to be a future
Or the world will end today

I'm here
But you can't see me

How gradually
I've become
Invisible

The absentee
Disappearing finally
Goodbye
Is it magic or the truth?
Strange psychology?
Or justified

Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Am I really even here?

It's too late
To find an excuse
The party's over
And I'm not much use
Tonight
Am I tragic or a joke
Wrapped in my invisibility cloak?
Well, quite.

Pete Brady Big Band,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Pete Church,"We take each other and walk through the open door.
From the first time that I saw you
To the way you look tonight
I was shaken by your spirit,
I was blinded by your light.

And the world that I used to see is gone without a trace,
Replaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face.
And I will not turn away
'cause you might disappear.
I was haunted by your heart
And I felt that you were here.

And funny when the time is right,
When lightning strikes,
You're not alone.
Baby, I will pray for you my whole life through
This day.

We'll be together,
Husband and wife,
Now and forever,
The rest of our lives.

Well, take me to heaven (ah),
Take me tonight (ah).
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day.

Oh, now is the hour, now is the sowing of the seed,
I will take tomorrow,
I will lay it at your feet.
And the two of us escape from the sadness of the world,
From the thunder and the darkness,
From the hunger and the hurt.

You know I will remember well the mission bell
That rings your name.
And baby there could never be
A memory like you.

We'll be together (ah),
Husband and wife (ah),
Now and forever (ah),
Lovers for life (oh).

Well, take me to heaven (ah),
Take me tonight (ah).
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day.

This is my pledge to you. 
I will follow through to the end.
And we will find another plane.
We'll be home again.
And tonight I'm going to find true love, true love.

Pete Corrigan,"'Tention folks, speak of jokes
This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Pete de Luke,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And Mr. Maxwell's got his tie too tight
Thought it might change the way his girlfriend felt 
To see him dressing up at night
He's got his cigarettes and his amphetamines 
He's got his coffee in the morning

There's something I think that you should know

When all of the stars were shining bright

We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right

Before it's too late
Let's wait awhile
Our love will be great

Before we go too far

I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater

Remember I said the same thing to you
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because, I'll never give up on you

Pete Escovedo,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';
'Cause I really love you, baby.
Oh, I really love you, darlin.

It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Was the love that we made just a brief masquerade

Was it just by chance we spoke of love
Or did you somehow feel that the wonder was real

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Pete Fountain,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.

pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

Pete Fountain,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",The Birth of This Blues

I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it

Pete Johnson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

Someone I simply can't help but adore

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Are you to give me

Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is

And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Pete Magadini,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
so hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you

Do you want to make love
Or do you just want to fool around
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you want to make loe
Or do you just want to fool around

You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else
Tale all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep

Or do you just want to fool around
