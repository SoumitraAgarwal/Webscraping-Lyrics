The Rat Pack,"You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old
With that smile a little bold
What a lovely lovely picture
You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture
Locked in a room in my heart
You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old
With that smile a little bold
What a lovely lovely picture
You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture
Locked in a room in my heart",Pretty as a Picture
The Rat Pack,"Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
And swear by stars above you?
Should I confess I love you?",Should I (Reveal)
The Rat Pack,"There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
The Rat Pack,"Thanks a lot!
I'm sure glad to be,
To be where I c'n see
So many friends o' mine.
How've I been doin'?
How've I been doin'?
If you really wanta know de truth,
I'm doin' fine!
Seventeen
Decisions in a row,
An' only five on points;
De res' was all K.O.
Jackson an' Johnson,
Murphy an' Bronson,
One by one dey come,
An' one by one to dreamland dey go.
How's it done?
You ask me, how's it done?
I got a trainer man
Who taught me all I need to know.
Sure feels good to have him in my corner,
Hear his voice a-whisp'rin' low:

""Big boy, remember,
You mus' remember
Stan' up an' fight until you hear de bell,
Stan' toe to toe,
Trade blow fer blow,
Keep punchin' till you make yer punches tell,
Show dat crowd watcher know!
Until you hear dat bell,
Dat final bell,
Stan' up an' fight like hell!""

When you fight
Out in de open air,
In a patch o' light
De ring looks small an' white.
Out in de blackness,
Out in de blackness,
You c'n feel a hun'erd thousan' eyes
Fillin' de night.
Cigarettes
Are blinkin' in de dark,
An' makin' polka dots
Aroun' de baseball park,
People are quiet~
Den dere's a riot!
Someone t'rows a punch
An' plants it right smack on de mark...
Somebody's hurt,
You kinda think it's you.
You hang across de ropes
Da's all you want to do.
Den you look aroun' an' see your trainer's eyes,
Beggin' you to see it through,
Dey say, ""Remember,
Big Boy, remember

Stan' up an' fight until you hear de bell,
Stan' toe to toe,
Trade blow fer blow,
Keep punchin' till you make yer punches tell,
Show dat crowd watcher know!
Until you hear dat bell,
Dat final bell,
Stan, up an' fight like hell!""",Stan' Up and Fight.
The Rat Pack,"Dear face that holds no sweeter smile for me,
Were you not mine, how dark the world would be
I know no light above that could replace
Love's radiant sunshine in your dear face.

Give me your smile, the love light in your eyes,
I could not hold a fairer paradise
Give me the right to love you all the while,
My world forever, the sunshine of your smile",The Sunshine of Your Smile
The Rat Pack,"When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak

I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
You know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now",Sway
The Rat Pack,"Up in the mornin' out on the job, work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'

The Rat Pack,"(In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl here's what they say)

When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine
That's amore
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta fazool
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scuzza me, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore

(When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie

The Rat Pack,"
I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd
There's my lover
But the crowd mustn't know
For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her




",There's My Lover
The Rat Pack,"There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!",There's No Business Like Show Business
The Rat Pack,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
The Rat Pack,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try

The Rat Pack,"Oh, ho
How would you like to be
Down by the Seine with me
Oh, what I'd give for a moment or two
Under the bridges of Paris with you

Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too?

Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

The Rat Pack,"You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be,
You got the power to hypnotize me

'Cause you do something to me
Nobody else could do

The Rat Pack,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

The Rat Pack,"The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know

I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list

You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joy
But friends, when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys

May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear

Oh, Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it?
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately, I've not slept a wink
Since this silly situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it?
She is cold, I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

And starts a fire there and then I lose control

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love

You've made me break a many true vow

You've filled my heart with weary old blues

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Won't help you through tonight
You make the eyes of a million girls
And think that's what they like

And now you go through a million girls
And try to pick what's right
When nightfall comes and you're still alone

The Raymonde Singers Etcetera,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

And I'm all about how it's gonna be, and I'm all about how it's gonna be
(I can't complain, I can't complain)
You opened up the world around me, me, me.

I couldn't have made it through,
I'm counting all my debts in my head, in my head.
('Cause I'll always be radio)

You spelled my name,
When I was young, I need you right there;
And you ran so fast.
You stayed the same.
Oh Melody, I hope that you care, you care, you care, you care.

Boys on the East Coast, scream with some heart!

Like a melody can?

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of a love so true

Just another night, another vision of love
You feel joy, you feel pain, 'cuz nothing will be the same
Just another night, is all that it takes
To understand, the difference between lovers and fakes

So baby, I talk, talk, I talk to you
In the night in your dream, of love so true
I talk, talk, I talk to you
In the night in your dream, of love so true

In the night, in my dreams I'm in love with you
'Cuz you talk to me like lovers do
I feel joy I feel pain, 'cuz it's still the same
When the night is gone I'll be alone

Another night, another dream, but always you
It's like a vision of love that seems to be true
Another night another dream, but always you
In the night I dream of a love so true

Just another night, another dream, another vision of love, with me
I'm here to set you free I am your lover, your brother
Hey sister let me cover, your body with my love
Is with my lovin' just another

Vision of a love, that seems to be true
All we do all the things that only lovers do
Vision of love, that seems to be true
All we do all the things that only lovers do

In the night in my dreams I'm in love with you
'Cuz you talk to me like lovers do

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?

There's a mood spreading round the world today
Can you feel the force?
It's with you in your work or at your play
Can you feel the force?
They're cleaning up the streets throughout the world
Can you feel the force?
Ghetto folk have had the final furl
Can you feel the force?

You can feel the pressure lifting off your head
People who make war are making love instead
This could be the dawning of another time
Hatred is a stranger we can see the sign

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?

All you people with your heads on the ground
Can you feel the force?
I can feel the hope spreading all around
Can you feel the force?
I can feel a new beginning in the air
Can you feel the force?
Peace and love forming everywhere
Can you feel the force?

You can see a change in people's attitudes
Looking to the future in much brighter moods
There's a message clearly written in the sky
Time to change and soon we'll all be flying high

Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?
Whoo oo oo ooo Can you feel the force?
Can you feel the force?

The sting that burns your open wounds.
I'll flood the ground. I swear on your grave, I'll bury this town,
But not for me, no never for me.

We have tested the buoyancy of loyalty.
You left our lungs for canteens.
You left our ankles for anchors.
We thought your arms were tied behind your back,
But elastic bands tied your hands.
You swim with reckless abandon.

Abandon ship! Mayday! Mayday!
Swim toward shore!
Our captain is overboard!
He punctured holes in the floorboards
To flood the bow just in time to bow out.
He's over bored and overboard.

Left in the wake, we man our own driftwood orphanage,
A second-hand sailor's fleet to flee.
But in the wake, we man our own driftwood orphanage.
Captain is over bored and overboard.

The Receiving End of Sirens,"This little light of mine
I was told to let it shine
But I stood idly by
And watched that poor flame die

I kept it from the bushel and brush
Away from the grasp of men
I left that lantern in the light
Where my flame could blend right in

I will bear this cross
And I will wear these thorns
I will bear this cross
I will wear these thorns

But I know all this dark won't swallow
All the light I hide but still host her
I'll learn to hold
She will grow and grow
And she will shine so bright

""Don't let Satan blow it out""
The teachers always said
But soon enough he figured out
It wasn't worth his breathe
'Cause this little light of mine
Is losing all its bright

Not to the dark, I hold inside
But to the dark kept from its sight
Below the smoke still burns a fire
A small spark lives 'neath all these ashes
Promise me you'll blow until I glow

I will bear this cross
I will wear these thorns

But I know all this dark won't swallow
All the light I hide but still host her
I'll learn to hold
He will grow and grow
And she will shine so bright

I've learned to smolder
All the smoke but no flame
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
(I will bear this cross)
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down
(I will wear these thorns)

But I know all this dark won't swallow
The light I hide but still host her
I'll learn to hold
She will grow and grow
And she will shine so bright

Ashes to ashes, we all fall down

I hated the moonlight!
Shadows of the night
That poets find beguiling 
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for
I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup 
For the saddest of all men
 
Once upon a time
My heart was just an organ
My life had no mission
Now that I have you
To be as rich as Morgan
Is my one ambition
Once I awoke at seven
Hating the morning light
Now I awake in Heaven
And all the world's all right

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a pray'r for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me

I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! Now I'm no longer alone

Without a love of my own

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",We Will Rock You/Eye of Tiger/Clumsy Lover

You put me on a boat across the sea, in the name of victory
But much to my surprised when I arrived, there was no welcoming committee
Instead there was a man for me to kill, and now I see how this is all too real

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade he whispered softly

Godspeed this letter, away from here
I've sealed it with my tears, and stamped it with my fists
And godspeed this letter, away from you
My work down here is through
I'm on my way to better days
And so are you

I'm in his pocket that I saw the picture of his children and his family
And I began to realize this person I despised, in actuality
Was not much different from myself
We probably could have taught each other many things
And now I know its much too late although I couldn't hesitate
I checked his gun, and his chamber was empty

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees

Come the darkest days
In the worst of ways

Close that town for good, the plagues here
The skin from beneath
All the way to the mouths they feed

And the judge decides
Get out while you can, she tells me
You're wasting time
That's fine

To the naked eye

Another Mekong please
Yes of course, you can keep the change
A new glass here for this new friend of mine
Forgive me, I've forgot your name
Flip a coin
What shall we talk about
Heads I tell the truth
Tails I lie

I came all the way
From Taipei today
Now Bangkok's pouring rain
And I'm going blind again
And I ain't seen my girl
In fifteen thousand miles

Is it true
It's always happy hour here
If it is I'd like to stay a while
And as cliche as it sounds
I'd like to raise another round
And if you bottles empty
Help yourself to mine
Thank you for your time
And here's to life

We need to go around again
One for me and what's his name
My new best friend
Deal me in
And I'll pick my cards up off the floor
I'll see my lucky coin
And raise a pack of lies

Smile to the girl at the door
Another 4 dollar whore
But don't look her in the eyes
She'll break your heart

Where were you I'd made it through
But only god can judge me now, I hope he's in

Why do hearts break when we are on our own?
Just when you need to pump the life back in yourself
And why do earthquakes happen miles away?
When I only want the open ground to swallow me

Who told you I'd not come through?
Before I could speak to you in my defense
Who made you the righteous one?
When I'd only turned around for half an hour

Why do chalk lines tell an empty tale
Surely its bad enough to end up on the floor

And think you understand

What's going on inside my head?

The Rembrandts,"Broken down on this, lonesome highway
Just my luck that you were, headed my way
Together...we drive off into the night

The Rembrandts,"No spell that I could cast would ever bring you back too soon

The view from here should soothe my soul, even shed some kind of light
Because I know the sun is shining, on the other side of night

On the other side of night
Now you're movin' through you wakin' world, while in my sleep, I dream
You drift as closely as you can, without your ever being seen
But I know you're there beside me, just beyond my line of sight

Out where the sun is always shining, on the other side of night
On the other side of night
If you had stayed...Would I have ever found a reason
To feel this way-If you had waited one more season

Though I know you're out there somewhere-Only you can prove me right

I want to be her victim
Look inside me-you will find me

No this house is not a home, without you
And what I mean to say, is that I need you now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you somehow
So if it's in your heart, to bring it home to me
Then we can get it back the way it should be

What will it take to make you mine?
What will it take to make you love me, for all time?

It's funny, how nothing ever stays the same
Helpless-never knowin' who's to blame
There once was a time when my love, was somethin' worth fightin' for
And now it's all I can do to remind you, of what could be

If that's what it takes, to make you love me, for all time

But I will wait for you forever-yes I will

All that I remember is your sirens call...and crashing on your beach
I was in pursuit of sunken treasure...drifting so far off my course
I should've seen the red sky, in the morning light...and followed my true north
Somewhere we got lost together
And on this island, found each other
In a million years, if ever
I could never want another
Be careful what you think you're wishing for...'cause you know it might come true
And happily ever after is an ending, only written for a fool...by a fool

Is something lost that can't be found?""

But it's a lie-You can't look him in the eye

The Rentals,"There’s nothing more beautiful right now
Than the thought of sound
It wakes you in the morning; it walks you on the night
When no one’s around;
It keeps you company when no one can figure you out
This sound of pure emotion gets up from the ground
You are free from the loneliness
You are free as a sunset
You are free from your hopelessness
You are free like a thought of sound
There’s nothing, really nothing more beautiful
Than the thought of sound
It wakes you in the morning; it walks you in the night
When no one’s around;
It keeps you company when no one can figure you out
This sound of pure emotion gets up from the ground
You are free from the loneliness (you are)
You are free as a sunset (you are)
You are free from your hopelessness (you are)

In a diary 
On the nightstand, by your bed
A long detailed anthology
Of all the mysteries
Locked away inside your head
Because it looks like I'll miss this
Another Christmas, another birthday, another round
One more summer, one more season, one more winter without a sound

I will read it when the days don't look so bad
Write it, write it, write it down
It's the story of a 1000 seasons' past
So now we have all this technology to send apologies
That just swim inside our heads
Our words are bouncing off the satellites
Through the lonely nights
Landing right inside our hands
The words are not as romantic, as they cross the Atlantic
In some virtual cry for help
Spend one more summer, one more season, one more winter by yourself

Tonight makes love to all your kind
Tomorrow's makin' Valentines

Hey you pop up in this old place
So sick and so refined (divine?)
Are you strung out on some face?
Well I know it ain't mine

If you were a pill, I'd take a handful at my will,
And I'd knock you back with something sweet and strong
Trouble keeping your head up when you're hungry and you're fed up,
Like a moon and a lone star you're gone

If you were a pill, I'd take a handful at my will,
And I'd knock you back with something sweet as wine
Yesterday was theirs to say, this is their world and their time
Well if tonight belongs to you, tomorrow's mine

The Residents,"What's a woman going to do but throw away her bread
Her feet are feeling funny as she lies beneath the bed
She reminisces of the pungent Adriatic Sea
And then she crawls and counts her cans and twitches like a flea

What she really likes to do is sit upon a pew
And make believe that time has stopped and motionless is new
Planes are stranded in the sky and drains are stopping, too
She alone is laughing under eyelids full of flu

She scurries hurries worries that the wicked will receive
Their candy from a handsome man and coffee from a thief
She gazes at a hourglass and asks it if it cares
And then she wonders if the lizard likes his lettuce rare

""Lizard, yes a lizard, little lizard of the sea
Conspicuously alcoholic, flicks his tongue at me
Release me, release me lizard, blizzard of the bee
Mushed inside a sock you still dare me to die
Dare me to die at home""

""Coating all my lungs with honey, sticky coating running runny
Feet of lizard fly and stop and fly and stop and fly
And flicker tongue is licking out to find me, feel me, hide!
Hide from the tongue""

""The tongue is coming! Cruising! Oozing!
Over land and under ashes, in the sunlight, see it flashes
Find a fly and eat his eye, but don't believe in me.

Don't believe in me, don't believe in me
Don't believe in me""

The Polar Eskimo has been relocated entirely into government housing, and now spends most of the day watching reruns on TV.
ESKIMO IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO N. SENADA WHO STARTED THE WHOLE THING",Epilogue
The Residents,"Angakoks, the Eskimo men of magic. are widely held as symbols ofmortal power among the tribe, Stories of their feats are very popular at tribal gatherings.
The whales whistled as the Eskimo tribe danced on and on to the lively beatof the ceremonial band. For twenty days they danced. And sang. And prayed. And still the ice floe hugged the shore line preventing the Eskimos from being able to kill their most valuable prey, the large migrating whale. Anger had been building in the people towards the Angakok who allegedly had the power to remove the ice that was blocking their passage. Finally a hunter challenged the magic of the Angakok with hostile words, and others soon joined him in the traditional taunt of ""necki, necki, necki"", until the Angakok rose up before them and silenced them with a single cry. A spell escaped from his lips and the sky darkened. A curse slipped from his finger and the seas swelled. The ice was cracking at last. But that dull roar?? The Eskimos looked at one another with fear in their weathered faces. Then it appeared. A ""giant snake which stands on the water"" wiggled before them with its head in the clouds. They briefly watched it eat a path through the ice floe, then hysterically ran for safety. But the water spout had one more job to do. The hunter who challenged the Angakok's magic was never seen again.

ESKIMOS HAVE WORDS FOR 40 VARIETIES OF SNOW.",The Angry Angakok
The Residents,"Arctic hysteria is a phenomenon that occurs in the dead of winter,primarily to women. The weeks of darkness and general sensory deprivation lead to the eventual temporary loss of a firm touch with reality.
Darkness prevailed everywhere. Beside her igloo, a woman sat in the windsinging softly to herself while beating the snow from her husband's seal fur clothing. Her voice and mind drifted with the soft tones of the nearby kooa player. Her song was about her work, but her unfocused eyes revealed a growing distance. The darkness seemed to confine her, and the singing voice seemed not to be her own.
The realization struck! ""I am dead, or at least the others believe I am"",she thought. Already she hears the pounding of the tribe's hands packing down the snow on her icy grave as they sing their song of farewell. The rhythm of death sounds in her ears.
She feels cold no more as her worst fears are realized. She has been sentto the ""Land of the Crestfallen"", where only the spirits of poor hunters and badly tatooed women spent eternity snapping at butterflies. But wait! Even worse! Instead of butterflies, the dreaded Arctic locust swarmed into the evening air devouring all in their path.
The men in the tribe had become aware of the woman's hysterical sufferingand joined in a circle to sing a chant of releasement. ""Chukaroq, chukaroq, chukaroq, ei"", they sang, until finally the woman once again returned to beating the snow mindlessly from her husbands clothing, virtually unaware of what had happened as her song of work faded into the wind.

The Residents,"Since the most important person in the Eskimo community is thehunter, and since hunters are always male, female infants are ritually killed if there is no infant male who will someday need a mate to cook, sew, and chew leather for him. This social condition adds to the drama of birth.
The pains were coming in regular intervals and she knew that if she didn'tstart moving now, her legs might collapse under her before she could reach the ice cave. The ceremonial band was already playing birth music and the other women sang in an attempt to comfort her. But as her steps carried her toward the ice cave and the ceremonial band's music became lost in the wind. the true lonliness of her situation loomed even larger in her mind. The gaping mouth of the ice cave eagerly awaited. And although she felt fear, she knew the cave also offered relief from her quickening pains, for this journey had been made many times before.
Her pace remained unchanged as she entered the cave, which now enlargedbefore her and engulfed her in the sweet music of slowly moving ice vibrating within its own cristaline formations. Deeper into the cave she went. The men were playing the kooa and chanting for the birth of a male.
Finally she reached the furthest chamber where stood the Angakok. Deliverybegan immediately as the magic man filled the room with protective prayers. The child was born. The Eskimo woman reached forth with her hand, gently across the already frozen crust on the infant's belly to feel the child's sex; the other women came into the chamber singing the song of life and bore the infant away.

The Residents,"Perhaps no holiday is more important to the Eskimo than the DeathFestival. More than a tribute to the dead, this festival marks the beginning of the yearly cycle by being held at the end of the six month Eskimo night.
Something moved in the dark. A face as tall as a man -- a big, round,evil face wandered at random. More faces and the realization: the dead walk the snow. Whistling and chanting, ""We have stolen the sun and you will have to live in darkness"".
But the women of the ribe, who were hiding in their igloos, then rushed outshrieking and beating their chests, proclaiming their right as the source of life. The dead spirits were frightened by the women and fled into the darkness. As the Eskimo band picked up their song, the women gathered in a circle, symbolizing nature's golden orb, and sang a hymn asking the dead to return the sun to the mothers of the snow.
The men, having removed their ""dead spirit"" masks, joined the women infestive songs and hand-clapping games until, at last, the first rays of sunlight of the Eskimo year began to appear over the horizon, signaling the end of six months of winter darkness. Gratefully, the dead had released their hold once more.",The Festival of Death
The Residents,"One of the many strange Eskimo phenomena is the disappearance ofchildren. In such inclumate conditions one can easily understand how this can happen. However, Eskimo mythology speaks of children being stolen by the spirit of the weeping seal, which is half seal and half woman, and who, because she can have no children, must steal any she finds unguarded.
Pop! the bladders went. Hunting season had been good and there were manybladders to burst. The band played gleefully, eager to get to the next peak in the music so all could explore the inflated bladders the creatures which had fed and clothed the Eskimos all year. Finally, the music ended and everyone immediately ran toward the sea, eager to throw the burst bladders through a hole in the ice so the souls of the animals could return to the sea and be caught again next year.
Because of the excitement, an important Eskimo rule has been broken. Achild was left unattended. Tears froze on his cheeks as he stood crying behind an igloo. Suddenly, there was another sound in the wind. A whistle, a bark,. a growling whine filled the air around the terrified child, whirling him around in a flurry of ice.
The Eskimo soon returned to discover that the child was missing, andrealized the folly of their over-excitement at the bladder festival. The Angakok started a chant to halt the fleeing spirit, but he knew the chant would only delay the spirit of the Weeping Seal's complete takeover of the child. They would have to go to ""the world beneath the world"" and fight.
Several dog sleds sped away across the tundra, whips cracking at the barking dogs. On the lead sled the child's father and the Angakok crouched, defending themselves against the blast of Arctic wind. The ride was long and tiring.
As they neared their destination, the men sang a chant and the Angakok spokea spell. A dog which was brought before him was decapitated, and the head, still containing the dog spirit, was quickly taken down to the neather world, while the other dogs, smelling the blood fo their own kind, howled into the cold night. The Angakok raised the god head into the air and called forth its spirit to battlethe Weeping Seal and force it to return the stolen child.
The two spirits met and intertwined in the air. With the Northern Lightsthey danced and sang, and then they disappeared slowly as the men returned to their village in hopes that the child would be there.",A Spirit Steals a Child
The Residents,"Walrus hunting in kayaks among the floating ice must sometimeproceed in the winter darkness or in a condition known as ""whiteout"" when atmospheric conditons turn the sky into a virtual mirror of the snow and ice below and orientation becomes difficult. At these times, women on shore blow a large horn made from a giant narwhal's hollowed tusk and chant to give directional orientation to the hunters.
Winter had almost arrived, for the wind had a more pronounced bite in itsinsistence. The noonday sun sat momentarily on the horizon before hastening back into the icy waters. Floating on the rising winds, the sounds of the narwhal horn and chanting combined to give assurance to the Eskimo hunters. The paddling of the kayak was smooth and steady. Not much light was left and a sleeping walrus could easily hide in the deep shadowed recesses of the floating icebergs.
But wait! There, on the ice... yes, a walrus! A happy but silentdiscovery. The sling-like harpoon was removed from its leather container and spun rapidly around over the hunter's head until sufficient speed was reached to send it zooming toward its unsuspecting prey. The walrus was hit. Cheers rang out from the men as they all paddled toward the animal which had plunged into the icy sea; but the water offered no protection as the Eskimo men reached for their whale bone clubs and bludgeoned the creature. The walrus floated quietly in the water and the kayaks moved on in search of other sleeping prey.",The Walrus Hunt

The Residents,"And so my story winds on down toward an ending that's been found to come
whenever all is said and done. I've lived my life and taken chances and if
some were strange by standards that were less important than my needs,
then I guess I could be crooked, evil, bent and twisted, looking down upon
the strings I tried to pull. But I see the strings extending up and down
and never ending as we dance around our selves and jerk to all the tunes
that only we hear and the voices only we fear each inside an island all
alone. But the contact that we do make, as we give and take abuse, stays
and its value only multiplies. Yes I'm alone, but not forgotten, for each
comes and sees me often, sitting on a seat beside my bed, and we laugh and
reminisce about a life that once was bliss before an act of passion made
us part. Of course they'll always be together, but their bond is made of
leather not the flesh and blood it used to be. They're still full of life
and healing, but it has a different feeling and only for the few that seek
their sort of pain and pleasure when they merge and give into insistent
urgency that lives for seconds at a time. For pain and pleasure are the
twins that slightly out of focus spin around us till we finally understand
that everything that gives us pleasure also gives us pain to measure it
by, and I also realize...that all our lives we love illusion, neatly
caught between confusion and the need to know we are alive.",Pain and Pleasure

Her teeth were in her hands and her tongue was hanging out;

He could be catching butterflies if there were any there.
All the freaks are not inside the tents
Some pay to come and be in the audience.
I saw a great big guy who had a little gun;
He pulled it out and smiled and then he sucked his thumb

Fastened to a child who cried beside their feet.

but I'll not even have disdain for him not even a stain on a memory
looked up to, lacking all respect for him I'm blacking out the specks
of decent thoughts that linger in me and leave only white white
peaceful white calm white swans silently flying in the snow look down
and see the bleached bones of a noble knight who died trying to save
his lady his lovely white lady who brought her man milk in the
moonlight but it was too late too late too late he said
Scratch out all the pin holes
Open up the sores

And give a troubled glance

When I place these pieces
In front of your weakness
Fall into depression
Your face has no expression

I'm making plans to disappear
I'm making plans to go anywhere
That's not in front of me
It's something you don't see

I'm making plans for everything
Let's include everyone
Well, everyone but me

This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all
This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all

You're fighting your conscience
You're acting self conscious
The pointless the past-tense
The accidental act of self defense

When I place these pieces
In front of your weakness
Fall into depression
Your face has no expression

I'm making plans to disappear
I'm making plans to go anywhere
That's not in front of me
It's something you don't see

I'm making plans for everything
Let's include everyone
Well, everyone but me

This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all
This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all

This goes out to anyone

This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all
This goes out to anyone who claims to know
Something about nothing at all

This goes out to anyone who claims to know

One with a severed artery across his wrist
We'll stop the bleeding but it's sure to infect
Who ever thought breaking hearts was such an easy task?

I'm not making excuses
Hey, there's nothing to say
Hey, let's drop the discussion
Last time I'll ever fall in love again

Time to step up to the batters plate

I never meant to hit the ball into your chest
I never meant to let my man steal home

We are idols in our prime of nothingness
Let's do it for the right reasons, except the right ones
Let's do it for a cause

You taught us how to listen
You taught us how to rock

And into Saturn's rings

We'll wish on the same star
Jump into my spaceship

And we'll blast away
Follow my lead Off to a new scene
Jump into my spaceship

And find a distant land
With no gravity
Let's bounce right up and down
We'll do it on a Wednesday
Maybe a Friday, too
We'll stare right at the earth
Never go back again

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Remember the past
Good times so funny
We never wanted to took the rest

We always looked for some action
The drugs promised fun
Too much speed along the line
Made me paranoid ­and not that I'll be strong

Got no excuse for all the things I've done
The only reason was fun, fun,­ fun
Got no excuse for every mistake
And now it is too late

We tried to smash the system
We needed riot at all
We went to a lot of demonstrations
Till everybody could hear our call

I had sympathy for terrorism
I felt like a red
I believed in a lot of ideas
And in my heart punk's still not dead

And now is too late
No, it's never too late

Now you're sleeping your days away
There is nothing more to say

And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,

And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games,
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,
Doomed to find out things a little too late,
And so I must play this broken man's role,
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,

Do you even notice I'm there?
The road goes on to the end
And you're the friend of a friend

So we meet and we smile
And inside I'm only a child
But lies have lost their appeal
My eyes betrayed what I feel

I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?

I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
Perhaps this time around you'd just might
But is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so right?

Do you see and do you know?
If you do, you don't let it show
The world is on all around
And I can always be found

So I walk and I ran
And I prayed it isn't too late
For who knows better than I
If time is passing me by?

I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?

I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
But I never once believed you really would

When loving you feels so good?
Tell me, is it so wrong to love you this way

She's got stars in her eyes and knots on her knees,
now her crazy grass shift really sways in the breeze now,
Ridin' down a heavy or lyin' in the sand, 
She's the hippest surfer girl in the land.
And she's my Honolulu Lulu, She's my Honolulu Lulu.
Queen of the surfer girls!
 
Well, she handles all the big ones ev'ry year of Macaha,
and all the surfers know her form Rincon to Baya.
When the beach is quiet and you know we're outa luck,
we pray for surf while makin' out in our truck.
Just me and Honolulu Lulu, Me and Honolulu Lulu.
Queen of the surfer girls!
 
I tell you, Once upon a time,you know, 
she got a little bold when she tried a hula spinner,
But her wax wouldn't hold. (Whoops!) 
Over the falls 'stead of hangin' ten,
But then she'd paddle out and try it again.
'Cause she's my Honolulu Lulu, She's my Honolulu Lulu.

The Rincon Surfside Band,"In Hawaii there's a place known as Waimea Bay
Where the best surfers in the world come to stay
And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last ride

Surf fever brings them here to meet the test
And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Ride ride ride the wild surf
Gotta take that one last
Gotta take that one last ride

The Rivieras,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
The Rivieras,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody

The Robertsons,"Now the night before Christmas, I was sitting in my house
And there wasn't nothing  moving around, not even a mouse.
The socks were hung by the fireplace to dry,
In hopes that old Santa Clause would bring me some pie

My children are grown, so nobody's in bed
And I got the sound of duck calls stuck in my head.
Mama's in her gown, and I got on my cap,
And I ain't tired, cause I took a three hour nap.

When all of a sudden, I heard a big crash
I figured it was some coon, diggin' in the trash
I went to the window, and slipped on my shoes
Cause I don't like critters, snooping around in my refuge

Now the moon was bright, and there was no sight of snow
And hey, I have the eyes of an eagle, just so you know.
When all of a sudden, what seemed to appear,
Was a tiny little tree stand, and whole lot of deer. Hmm

I knew I had seen him, he was acting very silly
And I was convinced, it could only be Willy
Now he was yelling and screaming, calling out names
And those deer started moving, and all those suckers came!

Now I thought he said ""Hey, Dasher, hey Prancer, and Spitzer
Maybe Comet, something about Cupid, Donner and Wolf Blitzer
Let's head to the roof, from there they would spring
These deers had magical powers, and all of them had wings

Now I took off my glasses, cause this was too weird
Big bucks turned into ducks, is what seemed to appear
Hey they circled around, and I swear that they flew
These deer had bags of my garbage, and big Willy in there too

And then, in a a flash, they was tearing up my roof
I heard the stompin' and chompin' of each little hoof
As I drew out my pistol, not knowing what to say
Down the fireplace came Willy, he must have got away

He had on a mink coat, from his bandana to his foot
And his clothes were all nasty, covered it ashes and soot.
He had my bag of garbage flung over his back,
And he looked like a fat raccoon, lookin' for a snack

As I stood there, wondering why he was not in bed
I yelled, ""Hey, I don't have any cookies you crazy knuckle head""
His mouth was wide open as he stood there in shock
Then I realized, I was in my tighty whites, with only a top

Alright, quit laughing boy

OK, Willy looked like he was smoking a pipe
I know I never seen that, and it didn't seem right
Not sure it was Willy's face, but no doubt it was his belly
With the unmistakable shake, cause hey, Willy loves his jelly

Willy's chubby and plump, like a fat little mouse
And I got tickled at seeing him and said ""Why are you at my house?""
He winked at me and smiled, as he set down his stash
I saw it was not my garbage, and it certainly was not my trash

Hey, this cat didn't say a word, as he pulled out some toys
And not just cheap crap. This stuff was for big boys!
He was doing a job, and he was going to work
This could not be Willy, because Willy, he's a jerk!

He left me some goodies, then he sprang in the air
I wasn't sure what I just saw, but hey, I didn't care
And I heard him yell out, as he left with his pack

The Rocco John Group,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",Bach to Bird

I wish even more you'd stop

The knowledge that you're going mad for me
I feel certain my friends would be glad for me
But it's bad for me

It's so good for me so new for me
To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

O how I count the hours 
Since we were torn apart

On the road to Fairfax County
I spied a highwayman
He wanted all my money
My heart beat like a drum

I gave him all my money
And sweet he smiled at me 
His beauty eye took pity
Beneath the old oak tree

We kissed but for an hour
The sun was newly warm
The clouds were as the flowers
That bloom but for a morn

He gave back all my money
And bowed most gallantly
He promised for to meet me
That night beneath the tree

We'd flee to some far island
And there we would be wed
And freely we would live there
With no price upon his head

That night I went to meet him
With my inheritance
He kissed me 'neath the half moon
And joyful we did dance

O love betrays all secrets
It whispers in the breeze
The sheriff he did follow
With all his deputies

Like hounds rushing to slaughter
The fox whose luck is run
And he stood erect and cursed them
God damn you every one

And heeding not my plea
They hung him from the oak tree

Beyond this world came a power
Struck into me I don't know how
It happened slow I want you to know
Her love is true music and it
Radiates around

Here comes a new day: clouds roll away
Don't ask me, I don't know a thing
Let's drive to town across the border line
Her love is true music and it
Radiates around

My chance for true happiness
It waits upon her kiss
How can it be, it feels so good to know all this

My heart may break and it might fall
She is mine and I am hers through seasons all
Let's drive to town
Across the borderline
Her love is true music
And it radiates around

The Rock of Ages Movie Band,"Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out this friendship has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crushing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running around in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window

I can't be left alone
Never seems forever

When will I lose this burden I wear?

There's no way that I can do this right
Gotta get you
Get you back into my life

How could this be you say to me?
You loved me like a jelly-bean
Regretful thoughts they break me
Make me see, without you I can't be me

See into you're brown eyes
Turn into you're brown eyes
See why you're world is down

What made you do it?

I came back, you weren't there
What happened to those times we shared?
I don't know, I guess they're gone,
Somehow I knew that all along
You were fake, there's no mistake
In that it's better your away from me
But still I think it seems so hard for me to see

What you see there had to be okay
See it's not so bad when your gone
You left me sad but no more turning back
Things just might get perfect again
I will be sad, so don't come back acting sad
Did you care? yeah whoa

Today I'm alone and now I know that I'll be fine
Even without you by my side
But I can't believe you left me there
'I love you' is what you said the day before
You packed your things and left

To be there, to care cause I know, I know that's rare
But when I hate everything about the mean things that I say
It feels like I mess up so much and I can only say
""I hate everything about my ways""
But you tell me I'm OK
And one day one day I know you'll say

""B I'm so glad you made it""
""oh well Jesus thank you so much for saying that""
Because the truth you know is that I have just been hating so many things I do
But now I realize forever that you're my friend
No matter what you will never leave me to fend
I don't know much but I know we will be
As happy as a 195o's TV family
Except times infinity

A family that I will be in
A family its just not pretend

So you can see what's inside
Cause wherever you go, well that's where I'll go
I'd do so much I'll show but you won't know
So here's a song to show for the things I've blown
But I'm sorry so... that's the only way that I know

And all I've learned is
What we hate we make, what we hate we make
There's no time for hating but what we hate we make

Something is about to change
I can feel it in my heart today
And you know its not the first time
But I bet it won't be the same
Cause right now I'm at an all time low
So here's a song just so you won't go
Cause that the only thing that I know

And I will start with a verse
Then a bridge, write a chorus
So we all can sing along
With everything we got
But between you and me this song would be
Written for us but I know that's not enough
To say I'm sorry

What we hate we make, what we hate we make
There's no time for hating but what we hate we make

If I were to speak.
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

Of asking you the same very thing.
He wants to say you're okay.

Walking down the street
Yes I did, and I started thinking
'Bout my destiny,
And how maybe, maybe just someday
I could repay all the times you sang

All of your warm colors
Have painted all my days
And all of the tragic tears
You took off of my face
'Cause I've fallen off of these train tracks
And nearly seen my death
And I stand here with a song
About to live

This will be my destiny
You will be my song and I will sing
So don't cover up your ears at me
And what I have to tell
I will bet these words, they find you well

I know, I know, when I see it
I will know, it's home
That I'll go, when it's my turn to clock out
It's almost like dreaming,
It's something I can't explain
That it's almost hard to think the same
To try to be a different way

This will be my destiny
You will be my song and I will sing

That you change that soon,
And I would hope and pray
If I were you.
Ooh oh oh.
Ooh oh oh oh,
If I were you
If I were you
If I were you
If I were you

I'd be asking every single person I knew
To gently say a pray for me,
'Cause I will most assuredly die this century
And in this opportune-filled life that I will leave

The Rocket Summer,"Just, walk away
And gather your thoughts for the second wave
Of this argument 
On this epic changing day
It's crazy to think that an hour ago all things were great.

But we stand here
Both proud both wrong and right
Throwing cheap shots 
In this stubborn fight
And our lives are so intertwined and one
But we're just so stuck in this moment and it's clear that we're coming undone

And you see it's hard for me to breath
When I got all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
But we can be so mad we consider it to not exist
But we both know that there's so much love clenched within our fists

The goodbye waves, in the driveway
Just resonate
And, yes, I'm throwing it right back at her
While we're drowning in rivers from our face
As we just want to know ""if this, is this, over""
A trembling silence fills the air
As we stand here
So impaired 
But so aware

Sit in this house
Alone with fresh photographs
And I just can't relax
Cigarette smoke 
I'm starting to choke on this
And half of my soul is on the road in a car with the girl in a dress

And see it's making it hard for me to breath
When I got all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
Just to say you're right, you're wrong, we both lose to it

The goodbye waves, in the driveway
Just resonate
And, yes, I'm throwing it right back at her
While we're drowning in rivers from our face
As we just want to know ""if this, is this, over""
A trembling silence fills the air
As we stand here (oh whoa)

So hey now
Maybe we're being stupid
Maybe we're being dumb
Maybe it's time that we stopped and we realize 
That fighting will win 
We are one
How at first it's pure and lovely
The battle can be torn to shreds

With time and with patience
And with love and affection
Can beat this with needles and thread

Because I love you
And do you love me?
And nothing will make that sway
I said I love you
And do you love me?
And nothing will make, could make, could make, could make it sway

Without you, I don't know what I would do,
But sometimes you make me so confused.
You don't mean to seem so rude.

Because it's cold outside you know
When you're away I try to be so right.
Close those big brown eyes tonight,
Make my dreams come true and be mine.
Go to this place you go,
You don't see how much you mean to me,
Mean to me.

I don't know how I don't regret those times
That every time I'd fall.
Sometimes I wonder why I talk.
I don't know how I could have thought
That you had found a place to stop,
Just hoping like me you had thought
That we're all we've got.

I'll say to myself that I don't care.
I'll be here for you any day or anywhere,
You just say those words
And I'll be there cause I don't care.

flowing through my veins
the anger like a drug it bites me like a rattle

Every soul, every being
The same air we all are breathing
One shared pulse collectively beating

Keep aiming for the circus, dancing in the freak show
Walk along the trail of bitter words from my tongue

Well now. I'm in a bout of seeing through the darkest clouds

Why would I want to go back in time or to tomorrow?
Why would I want to go back or worry about what the future holds?
