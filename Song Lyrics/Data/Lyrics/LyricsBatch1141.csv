Bénabar,"Les gens sont venus juste pour nous voir
Ca les rend contents d'entendre notre fanfare
On a des uniformes verts des casquettes
Moi pour faire mieux j'ai mis des épaulettes

Mon tuba s'enroule en boa constricteur
Je l'ai tellement briqué qu'on dirait de l'or
Son pavillon qui brille c'est mon auréole
On se voit dedans ça déforme ça gondole

Je marche tout derrière avec les tambours
les lèvres collées à mon embouchure
Tonnent les basses résonnent les cymbales
Tempêtent les trompettes fête municipale

J'aime bien parader habillé comme tout le monde
D'habitude on me moque
Alors j'aime bien qu'on me confonde avec
Le fils du notaire le gérant de l'épicerie
Moi je ramasse les feuilles pour la mairie

Et les majorettes sautillent en cadence
Emmenées de main de maître par la reine de la danse
Elle s'appelle Nadège elle est drôlement belle
D'ailleurs on est tous amoureux d'elle

On dirait avec sa queue de cheval
Une sirène avec des jambes normales
Sa mini-jupe rouge que j'aime vachement
Parce qu'on voit sa culotte tout le temps

Petit pont arrière salto fléchissement
Un pas de coté le tout en souriant
Elle lance son bâton qu'elle rattrape à tous les coups
Et reprend sa marche en montant les genoux

""T'es belle comme une fée comme Miss Picardie
Une fille de la télé un Ferrari""
C'est ce qu'y avait dans la lettre que je lui ai envoyée
Elle sait pas que c'était moi j'ai pas osé signer

Parce qu'il y a un problème c'est un militaire
Qu'à un bel uniforme un vrai un de l'armée de l'air
Il fait son service à la caserne d'à coté
A la fête foraine Nadège l'a embrassé

Moi aussi j'aurais pu avoir le même uniforme
Pourquoi c'est toujours les mêmes qu'on réforme
parce que dans ma tête y a un truc qui va pas
La patrie et Nadège y veulent pas de moi

Des fois je fais des rêves j'ai mon uniforme vert
Mais dans mon rêve c'est celui de l'armée de l'air
Je défile en tête sur les Champs-Élysées
Et Nadège elle est fière dans mon rêve on est mariés

Mais quand grand-mère me réveille
Je redeviens celui qui ramasse les feuilles
Le bon à rien qu'a pas toute sa tête
Et les enfants me moquent et me traitent

Les enfants je m'en fous d'ailleurs je m'en fous de tout
Des jupes des majorettes et de ce qu'y a en dessous
Je voudrais tous qui crèvent avec leur fanfare
Les vrais uniformes et leurs beaux militaires

Je vais faire de fausses notes saccager la Madelon
Pour que Nadège rate une fois son bâton
Leur gâcher la parade leur casser les oreilles
Je suis bon à rien la preuve
Je ramasse les feuilles mortes.",Majorette
Bénabar,"Au sanglots dans le combiné je savais que c'était toi
Raconte-moi tes malheurs mais d'abord mouche-toi!
Tu t'es fait plaquer par le nouvel homme de ta vie
Pourtant tu le connais au moins depuis vendredi

La dernière fois c'était un homme marié
Qui devait divorcer t'avais pas le droit de l'appeler
Il voulait faire les choses bien pour pas que sa femme souffre
Il lui a fait un autre gosse pour sauver son couple et ses pantoufles

T'étais dans la passade du cap de la quarantaine
Mais comme dit ton psy ""c'est 300 francs et à la semaine prochaine!""

Avec tes rêves de midinettes et ton cœur d'artichaut
T'es une porcelaine dans un magasin d'éléphants
Y a pas forcément de prince charmant
Derrière tous les crapauds!

Le printemps dernier ton horoscope était formel
T'allais rencontrer l’âme sœur y avait Mercure dans ton ciel
T'as aimé un capricorne ton signe complémentaire
Il était bisexuel les astres sont parfois tête en l'air

Souviens-toi du connard la brute au grand cœur
Une enfance difficile sûrement battu par son père
Tu trouvais plein d'excuses à ce beau célibataire
Quand il te collait une danse c'était un transfert

Passons sur le macho qui te donnait tout le temps des ordres
Et l'écrivain qu'écrivait rien que tu trouvais génial
Celui qui vendait tes bijoux pour s'acheter sa poudre
Et y a eu moi aussi mais c'est pas pareil

Enfin comme prévu t'es tombé raide dingue de ton psy
C'était l'image du père un complexe œdipien enfoui
Il a gâché votre première nuit qui devait être la plus belle
En débarquant dans la chambre vêtu de porte-jarretelles!

Ça t'as fait un choc tu disais ""les hommes sont tous pourri!""
Mais comme dit ton psy ""prend le fouet il est sous le lit!""",Porcelaine
Bénabar,"Voilà plus d'une heure que je te tiens dans les bras
Voilà quelques jours que je suis tout à toi
Il est très tard et tu dors pas
Je t'ai fait une berceuse, la voilà

Demain le jour sera là et les oiseaux chanteront leur joie
Tes paupières d'or s'ouvriront sur le soleil et sur sa chanson
Ferme les yeux
C'est merveilleux et dans tes rêves
Toutes les fées viendront te réveiller
Fais dodo, pourquoi tu dors pas?

Demain il faut que je me lève tôt
J'ai un rendez-vous hyper important
Si t'aimes ton père, si tu l'aimes vraiment
Sois fatigué et dors maintenant
J'ai sauté sur l'occase
T'avalais ton biberon pour un micro-sommeil de dix secondes environ
C'était confort, j'ai bien récupéré, maintenant tu dors
T'arrêtes de nous faire, fais dodo

Demain le jour sera là
Et les oiseaux chanteront leur joie
Tes paupières d'or s'ouvriront sur le soleil et sur sa chanson
Ferme les yeux, c'est merveilleux et dans tes rêves toutes les fées
Dors dors dors! Bordel, pourquoi tu dors pas?
Dors dors dors! Laisse dormir ton papa!

Ce que tu regardes en riant
Que tu prends pour des parachutes
Ce sont mes paupières mon enfant, c'est dur d'être un adulte
Allez on joue franc jeu, on met cartes sur table
Si tu t'endors je t'achète un portable, un troupeau de poneys
Un bâton de dynamite, j'ajoute un kangourou si tu t'endors tout de suite

Tes paupières sont lourdes
Tu es en mon pouvoir, une sensation de chaleur engourdit ton corps
Tu es bien, tu n'entends plus que ma voix
Je compte jusqu'à trois, et tu vas t'endormir

Pourquoi tu veux pas dormir, pourquoi, tu dors pas?
Je te donnerais bien un somnifère
Mais y en a plus, demande à ta mère, t'es insomniaque ou quoi?
Puisque tu me laisses pas le choix
Voici le temps des menaces, si tu dors pas je te place
Dors dors dors! Mais on dirait que ça marche
Tu fermes les yeux, tu es si sage, c'est merveilleux
Tu dors comme un ange, tu as de la chance, moi aussi j'ai sommeil
Mais c'est le matin, faut que je m'habille
Je me suis énervé, mon amour, je le regrette
Pour me faire pardonner je vais te jouer un peu de trompette!",La Berceuse
Bénabar,"Je n'avais pas de cadeau
Pour t'offrir à Noël 
J'en voulais un très beau
J'ai pensé à Bruxelles
Offrir une ville c'est vaniteux
Je le reconnais mais je m'en fous
Parce que c'est quand même mieux
Que de rien offrir du tout
Tu te serais contentée
D'un cadeau moins trompe-l’œil
D'un livre ou d'un CD
D'une paire de boucles d'oreille
Mais dans une bague ou un collier
Je te mets au défi
De faire entrer sans les casser
Saint-Jose et la Gare du Midi 

Alors Bruxelles je te la donne
Mais faut le dire à personne
Ça menacerait la couronne
Et j'ai donné ma parole d'homme
(Qui vaut ce qu'elle vaut)

Il a fallu que le roi s'en mêle
Il disait à court d'arguments
""C'est ma capitale, bordel! 
Et ce n'est pas un présent""
J'ai dit ""Mon King, je vous arrête
Bruxelles est un joyau 
Nous sommes en période de fêtes
C'est idéal comme cadeau""
Il s'entêtait dans son refus
Je l'ai d'ailleurs trouvé têtu
Il disait ""C'est pas à toi 
Et tu peux pas l'offrir comme ça
Bruxelles est aux Bruxellois""
""C'est entendu"" j'ai dit au roi 
""Mais ils n'en sauront rien
Ce sera notre secret, mon cher souverain""

Alors Bruxelles je te la donne
Mais faut le dire à personne
Ça menacerait la couronne
Et j'ai donné ma parole d'homme
(Qui vaut ce qu'elle vaut)

""Moi qui suis roturier
C'est mon seul titre de noblesse
Je voudrais négocier
Soyez cool votre Altesse""
Le roi qui est un gentleman
A étudié la question
""Comme c'est pour une dame
Je vais te faire une proposition""
""Bien entendu"" m'a-t-il dit
""Tout ça ne sort pas d'ici
Mais en échange je veux Paris
En dessous de quoi je gagne pas ma vie!""
Sans hésiter j'ai répondu
""C'est d'accord, marché conclu
Avec vous, Messire
Faire des affaires c'est un plaisir""

Alors Bruxelles je te la donne
Mais faut le dire à personne
Ça menacerait la couronne
Et j'ai donné ma parole d'homme
(Qui vaut ce qu'elle vaut)",Bruxelles
Bénabar,"Il y aura hier des années de ça
Nous étions tout de suite aujourd'hui déjà
La course cycliste qui remonte la rue
Les épaules de mon père, ce sera le début

Pour le défilé je tenais un fanion 
J'aurai un chiot et je perdais mon chien 
Le mois d'après, y a longtemps, nous rirons
Ce sera les vacances quand c'était le mois de juin

Mais que ferais-je du cahier de solfège? 
De temps en temps

J'ai répondu présent quand questionne la maîtresse
J'en ai eu du chagrin, mes larmes je les sèche
J'apprenais bien après la concordance des temps
Il est déjà trop tard parce que je serai grand

Quand j'étais écolier, je serai lycéen
Mais pour l'instant c'était encore loin
Dans l'école de musique, celle de mon quartier
J'étudie le solfège et j'avais un cahier

Mais que ferais-je du cahier de solfège? 
De temps en temps

Quand c'était maintenant, un bébé sur les genoux
Il s'endort notre enfant, tu verras, entre nous
La semaine dernière j'espère qu'il a fait beau 
Je t'emmène à la rivière, nos six pieds dans l'eau

Il y aura un jour, mais c'était dans longtemps
Que j'ai retrouvé par hasard en rangeant
Ce cahier griffonné qu'on m'a donné demain
Ce cahier de solfège que je tiens dans les mains

Mais qu'en ferais-je de tous ces arpèges? 
Ça me revient

Bénabar,"Je veux pas y aller à ce dîner
J'ai pas le moral, je suis fatigué
Ils nous en voudront pas
Allez, on n'y va pas
En plus faut que je fasse un régime, ma chemise me boudine
J'ai l'air d'une chipolata
Je peux pas sortir comme ça
Ça n'a rien à voir, j'les aime bien tes amis
Mais je veux pas les voir 
Parce que j'ai pas envie

On s'en fout, on n'y va pas
On n'a qu'à se cacher sous les draps
On commandera des pizzas
Toi, la télé et moi
On appelle, on s'excuse, on improvise, on trouve quelque chose
On n'a qu'à dire à tes amis 
Qu'on les aime pas et puis tant pis

Je suis pas d'humeur, tout me déprime 
Et il se trouve que par hasard
Y a un super bon film à la télé ce soir
Un chef-d’œuvre du septième art que je voudrais revoir
Un drame très engagé sur la police de Saint-Tropez
C'est une satire sociale 
Dont le personnage central 
Est joué par de Funès, en plus y a des extraterrestres!

On s'en fout, on n'y va pas
On n'a qu'à se cacher sous les draps
On commandera des pizzas, toi, la télé et moi

J'ai des frissons, je me sens faible
Je crois que je suis souffrant
Ce serait pas raisonnable 
De sortir maintenant
Je préfère pas prendre de risque, c'est peut-être contagieux
Il vaut mieux que je reste 
Ça m'ennuie, mais c'est mieux
Tu me traites d'égoïste?
Comment oses-tu dire ça! 
Moi qui suis malheureux et triste 
Et j'ai même pas de home-cinéma!

Bénabar,"Un bébé encadré sur une étagère, 
Un souvenir de vacances, un anniversaire. 
Une fille qui sourit coincée dans un sous-verre, 
Un cadre fantaisie, un bord de mer, 
Et personne ne bouge dans la tribu des yeux rouges, 
Tous différents, les mêmes photos pourtant
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Quelques photos de couple exposées comme des preuves,
Des photos de groupe, des amis qu'on punaise. 
On vérifie d'ailleurs l'air de rien chez les autres, 
Qu'on fait partie des leurs, qu'a côté de leurs têtes y a la nôtre. 
Sur la cheminée du salon des grands-parents, 
Le casting tout entier de tous les petits enfants
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Les albums familiaux sont les manuels d'histoire, 
Qu'on regarde jamais, qu'on réserve au placard. 
Quand il était jeune, quand t'étais petit, 
Quand elle était enceinte, quand ils étaient en vie. 
Portraits de fin d'année des gosses trop bien peignés, 
On dirait vraiment qu'ils ont mangé du ciment
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

La photo censurée, elle s'y trouvait pas belle, 
Aussitôt développée, direct à la poubelle. 
Mignonne en paréo au retour de la plage, 
Elle enlèvera pas le haut, c'est dommage. 
Le portrait qui fait rire du permis de conduire, 
Celui qui fait peur, qu'est-ce que c'est que cette coiffure?
Qu'elles soient en couleur ou bien en noir et blanc, 
On fait tous, quelle horreur ! les mêmes photos tout le temps
Les grands derrière, les petits devant.

Qu'est-ce qui nous pousse au fond à refaire à la chaîne,
Tous les mêmes photos qu'on a vu par centaines,
Des photos de monuments qui sont jamais très belles, 
Mais c'est nous qui l'a fait, c'est pas la carte postale! 
Les photos de voyage à l'autre bout de la terre, 
Les mêmes paysages, des mêmes belvédères. 
Nous sur un chameau, nous au ski en hiver, 
Re-nous sur un bateau
Et les épices du souk du Caire. 

Re-re-nous à Pâques, y a deux ans déjà, 
Re-re-re-nous à la Toussaint à côté du Etretat. 
C'est vrai qu'on voit pas bien, que la photo est mauvaise, 
Mais par la salle de bain je te jure on devinait les falaises!
Et ces photos souvenirs qu'on stocke acharnés 
Pour pas qu'on puisse nous dire qu'on a pas profité.
Rangées dans un tiroir celles qu'on veut plus voir 
Et classées dans des livres des photos d'archives. 
J'ai encore jamais vu et ça chez personne, 
Sa copine toute nue au dessus du téléphone, 
La photo de son patron dans aucun salon, 
Mais des vues de bords de mer, 
Ah ça putain on sait le faire! 
Qu'on les range en vrac, qu'on les colle au mur, 
Au fond d'un portefeuille ou dans un disque dur, 
Au fin fond de la Creuse, à Paris 16ème, 
On prend les mêmes poses, nos photos sont les mêmes.
Qu'on soit le frère, la sœur, les parents, la tante, 
Toujours les mêmes photos, mates ou brillantes:
Des images inutiles sur toutes les vieilles pierres, 
Le Mont-Saint-Michel
Et les épices du souk du Caire!",Les Épices du Souk du Caire
Bénabar,"Déjà lavé en pyjama qui me gratte,
Dans la télé des Claudettes, en grappe,
Parce que demain y a pas école, Mike Brandt, Sacha Distel.
Play-back et pattes d'éléphant,
Rouflaquettes et costumes blancs,
Ils avaient des beaux habits
Qu'ils doivent regretter amèrement aujourd'hui.
Ils portaient bien la moustache,
Dans des décors pas encore kitch,
Micro tenu du bout des doigts,
En éloignant le fil d'un geste du bras.

Sont heureux de vous présenter,
Attention l'émission va commencer,

Quelques décors pour faire Broadway,
Un réverbère, un cabaret,
Un faux saloon c'est l'Amérique,

Bénabar,"Un terrain vague, de vagues clôtures,
Un couple divague sur la maison future.
On s'endette pour trente ans, ce pavillon sera le nôtre,
Et celui de nos enfants corrige la femme enceinte.
Les travaux sont finis, du moins le gros œuvre,
ça sent le plâtre et l'enduit et la poussière toute neuve. 
Le plâtre et l'enduit et la poussière toute neuve. 

Des ampoules à nu pendent des murs, du plafond,
Le bébé est né, il joue dans le salon.
On ajoute à l'étage une chambre de plus,
Un petit frère est prévu pour l'automne.
Dans le jardin les arbres aussi grandissent,
On pourra y faire un jour une cabane. 
On pourra y faire un jour une cabane. 

Les enfants ont poussé, ils sont trois maintenant,
On remplit sans se douter le grenier doucement.
Le grand habite le garage pour être indépendant,
La cabane, c'est dommage, est à l'abandon.
Monsieur rêverait de creuser une cave à vins,
Madame préférerait une deuxième salle de bain. 
Ça sera une deuxième salle de bain. 

Les enfants vont et viennent chargés de linge sale,
ça devient un hôtel la maison familiale.
On a fait un bureau dans la petite pièce d'en haut,
Et des chambres d'amis, les enfants sont partis.
Ils ont quitté le nid sans le savoir vraiment,
Petit à petit, vêtement par vêtement. 
Petit à petit, vêtement par vêtement. 

Ils habitent à Paris des apparts sans espace,
Alors qu'ici il y a trop de place.
On va poser tu sais des stores électriques,
C'est un peu laid c'est vrai, mais c'est plus pratique.
La maison somnole comme un chat fatigué,
Dans son ventre ronronne la machine à laver. 
Dans son ventre ronronne la machine à laver. 

Les petits enfants espérés apparaissent,
Dans le frigo, on remet des glaces.
La cabane du jardin trouve une deuxième jeunesse,
C'est le consulat que rouvrent les gosses.
Le grenier sans bataille livre ses trésors,
Ses panoplies de cow-boys aux petits ambassadeurs,
Qui colonisent pour la dernière fois la modeste terre promise,
Quatre murs et un toit.

Cette maison est en vente comme vous le savez,
Je suis, je me présente, agent immobilier.
Je dois vous prévenir si vous voulez l'acheter,
Je préfère vous le dire cette maison est hantée.
Ne souriez pas Monsieur, n'ayez crainte Madame,
C'est hanté c'est vrai mais de gentils fantômes.

De monstres et de dragons que les gamins savent voir,
De pleurs et de bagarres, et de copieux quatre-heures,
""finis tes devoirs"", ""il est trop lourd mon cartable"",
""laisse tranquille ton frère"", ""les enfants, à table !"".

Non ça c'est réservé aux esthètes à la dérive,
Qui jugent la déprime démodée.
Je n'ai pas la gourmandise qui consiste à tout détester,
c'est pas pour moi le mal de vivre, c'est beaucoup trop raffiné.

Ça ira mieux demain, du moins je l'espère,
Parce que c'est déjà ce que je me suis dit hier.

La larme à l'œil en automne parce qu'elles sont mortes les feuilles,
alors que je les connaissais à peine,
Elles étaient même pas de ma famille.
Ce n'est pas par désespoir,
Il faudrait vaille que vaille souffrir du matin au soir,
C'est beaucoup trop de travail.

Ça ira mieux demain, du moins je l'espère,
Parce que c'est déjà ce que je me suis dit hier.

Ce n'est pas non plus du spleen pourtant c'est toujours à la mode,
Mais c'est de la déprime qui frime le spleen, c'est beaucoup trop snob.
Et c'est pas de la mélancolie, c'est dommage ça m'aurait plu,
Mais les chanteurs ont déjà tout pris, y en avait plus.

Parfois au désespoir… le couche-tard.

Et pour mettre du vin dans son eau, il attend ses jours de repos…

Transcend the Rubicon

At life's shore slowly breaks the waves
Turn of the tides, revenance of rage
Blistering so were the thoughts
When shackled to a wall
Flagrant ways of conformation
Your death sentence appalled
Now plead for a worthless life
Deny us for your guilt
Escape within the stoney tomb
Which you yourself have built
Independence of a drug
To satisfy the need
Orgies filled with travesty
To sow all mocking seeds
Originality the one
Who's screaming at the crime
Sinister the ways of wisdom
Expand or face the fire
Sterile splinter of self doubt
Thorn in your boney hide
Counterfeit within adept
Colossal is the pride
Breeding cynicism
Grandeur crying in your face
Overture derisive laughter
Hateful human race
Incantation of your thoughts
Upon this mortal coil
Open wide the jaws of hate
Serving them so loyal
Reeking contradiction
When you're laughing as you fail
Believing in your innocence
Tells a sorrowed tale
Autumn fall upon a life
This season at an end
Darkened shadows all around
And yet without a friend
Realisation dawns on you
It's time for you to face

Benediction,"Dedicated to Julian May, author of ""The Many Coloured Land(The Saga of the Exiles in the Pliocene epoch)
The rupture of the brain from flesh, children of the black.
Devouring mother, call her blessed, with impetus they lack.
Glorified spineless triumph, sick polluted mind.
Grusome child in void, evolution of humankind.
Operant child in unity. Unseen, unheard this day.
Floating mind is veiled in blood, the body is taken away.
Stripped of appendages, ungiven choice.
Awaiting intervention, mind without a voice.
Mentally amplify, cerebral lustrate.
Life after bodily death, brain without a face.
Black mother feeds the rancourous scorn, sinful propagate.
Metaphysically entity, redact, coerce, farsense, create.
Infinite years, immortality chained. Aeons herein encased.
Artificial, surrogate overt inhuman waste.
Divorced from purile emotion, hidden humanity,
Body, a cremated epitaph. Torso innutility.
Utterance of death's blessing. Funeral absent dream.
Muted in a voiceless uproar, deafened to hear her screams.
Banished to an exile life, prisoner of the brain.
Mind enhancer switches in, with unrelenting pain.
Bodiless mentally, The twisted saint began.
Spawned inside a sterile womb, nurturing the mental man.
",Ashen Epitaph [#]
Benediction,"Inner deformity, such a foul deceptive rot.
Conceiving the grotesque. Nothing is but what is not.
Screeds of verbiage, never explained. Gazing at the flames.
Inside the dungeon or my skull, only mawkish thoughts remains.
Grotesque addict, forever shadowed,
Darkness clouding me. Absurdity now fate.
Bizzarre dreams, an horrendous nightmare,
Nothing left but to hallucinate.
Dementia reigns, a predilection. Total order cease.
Rescrudescent, this condition. Coherency decrease.
Humanity is not to shine, in my bloodless face.
Magnified in travesty, I have been displaced.
See with the eye of the mind. That the lie will speak.
Traumatic cracks in my addiction, made the future bleak.
Paralysed to ruminate, embolismic bitter jest.
Ontologically I'm dead, reborn as the grotesque.

Benediction,"You guard your mind, your thoughts must not devour
Your soul at crux will cower
And the image is mine
Taunting you, unleash eternal time
Am I what you see ?
Rising doubts will forever be set free
Torment, I return
From thoughts you¹ve had and are now left to burn
The degree of heat
Denial of lies, the words are incomplete
Yet what is said is true
All you fear cannot be miscontrued
Bizarre made flesh - The heart arrest
What you fear most - Will haunt the host
I¹m whole, I become as one
Evil thoughts extinguishing the sun
And in the void I thrive
Fear / strength, it procreates the hive
And the tears burn
Forced desires you are soon to learn
Bizarre made flesh - The heart arrest
What you fear most - Will haunt the host
Guard your minds, your thoughts have all devoured
Your soul at crux it cowered
And the image was mine
Taunted you, unseashed eternal time
I am what you see

As cells break away
Blistering assault on pure
Gnawing into cells
Slow disease, yet so demure
Struggling you ail
Insidious disease
Evicts me from my life
Disfiguring, absurd
The inner parasite
Soul destroying, my skin crawls
Unseen, my body fights a war
Dig deep the healthy flesh
My miserable remnant
Ruined by this ruthless waste
Paying my penance

Detected early, a surgical cure
Perchance a growth in the bones

Start from this waking dream

Defiant in it¹s death
Smelled the fragrant bitter blood

Benediction,"I lie screaming
Remembrance of the past
Emotions betray me below
Adversity - My martyrdom
Rancid breakdown bethothed

Memories of passion overwhelming me
Corrupted love is displaced
The insect onset, death does not liberate
Deadfall, her final embrace

Forced to watch her decompose
Putrefy, it fills my nose
Tears in anguish I grieve

Smell the scent upon her shoulder
Festering, begins to moulder
Maggots are conceived

My delusions now torment me
Agonising the misery
At this point of death we do not part

Visualise my partner's corpse
I have but love and no remorse
In the final death-throes of my heart

Look her in the eye
Repulsive way to thrive
Death's spawn I feed
Choking on the fumes
In this heat infested room
My heart it bleeds

Lying trapped, my mind is free
Hallucination, fantasies
Relieve the life from when we met
Now I'm in her death's restrain
Horrific visions through my brain
Her rigor mortis starts to set

Memories of passion overwhelming me
Corrupted love is displaced
The insect onset, death does not liberate
Deadfall, her final embrace

With her corruption I'm paralysed
Optic fluids pour from the eyes
Foul stench of decay makes me retch
Sweetly smiling from her jaws
Death opens wide it's sharpened claws
This death's erotic, how I letch

I thank god I'm an atheist
Prolong my anguish - subtract bliss

And as she rots
This nightmare never stops
I long for peace
In the end
Death is my lonely friend
I crave release

I lie screaming
Smothering in love
Now at the Reaper's call

They gain control

But slowly our vision dies, shadow hood the foe
Debased to Anarchy, open up the pit
Spilling a deluge of black
Swallowing the light, crushing all heart

Bristling with agony once more
A voice deep inside your head screams FUCK IT!

Spiraling annihilation
Descent into the abyss
A boiling, blackened violence and hatred
Some fucker's gonna pay for this!
A victim less crime of passion
Or rape of mind and soul
Or the bastard even destroys himself

Beyond the limits of the human mind
Just one more time, it's really making sense

Fall away from a life of care
Sink into a lifeless state

Some choices when they've made can't be erased
Try to forget yourself

I'll be the freak
Turn and hide from the mask you see
Misshapen face of fear

I will be your obscenity
I will be the depraved
I will be your deepest fear
That lights the dark that you so crave

Created in honor, in honor to live
Invisible, terror descends
The deepest fear come true
One false move and you know you'll fall
The abyss of nightmares gapes below you

Hideous to look upon
A deformed face, a bastard son
A pantomime, a colorful tale
Yet in this theater, no beauty prevails

How could they do this to me?
My Lord, he never cared
Screaming for help and I was not saved
Tried to trust but I found despair

They have despised me since the day I was born
Reviled by truth, their minds too small
Tearing open blinded sightless eyes
Only death is real the true demise

Unquenchable thirst never slaked
Set loose the storm within me
It rages on

I'll obliterate all you doubters
With my hammers of twisted truth
Drive the nails deeper into your hands
Feed the sickness, destroying you

Surprise on their faces is joy to behold
Try to silence me, but killing me now won't work
Eternal heretics forever speak

I am the disease
I am that which rots inside
Festering within
There is no cure for my plague

And though I die in vain
I die with open eyes
Take the grave this sight from me

Pensé en llamarte Abril Oneil

Repetí tu nombre
Una dos y cien mil veces

Cuéntame

Cuéntame
Robamos el silencio

Abre tu ventana
Deja que te llame

Se pone duro y nada queda
Para hacerte sentir mejor

Todo va a estar bien

Ya sé que es lo que queda
Hacernos derretir por horas
Tirarnos de un avión y en la
Caída desarmarnos

Caer sin protección y
De subida hacernos únicos

Y hay veces que te vas
Y que quisieras, encontrarte
Ser una piedra más
Y no sentir el agua ahogarte

Las ganas de morir se vuelven
Cada vez más fuertes
No encuentro nada que me haga
Sonreír

Y que digas que no me crees
Ya se que es lo que queda

De subida hacernos únicos

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Beni,"鳴らない電話片手に
あなたを想うばかり
こんな夜は不安で眠れない
終わりがすぐそこに感じて
自分でもわからない 私らしくない
追いかけるほど辛いのに
ねぇどうしてあなたなの?
あなたじゃなきゃダメなの?
私だけ私だけ 見てくれないの?
私だけを愛せないの?
届かない届かない 傍にいるのに
手を伸ばしたら消えちゃいそうで…
約束の場所で今日も待つ
いつまでも現れない
本当にあなたらしいよね
なんで嫌いになれないの?
泣いてばかりの 恋に溺れたくない
わかってても止められない
ねぇどうしたら私は
あなたの一番になれるの?
私だけ私だけ 見つめて欲しい
私だけに甘えて欲しい
今すぐに今すぐに 逢いたいなんて
言えないのは ただ好きだから
優しい顔して 突き放して
期待する度 また傷ついて
初めから叶わない恋なら
出会わなければ良かったのかな
あなただけあなただけ 他の誰にも
満たされないこの心
どうしてもどうしても失いたくない
好きだから… 好きだから…
私だけ私だけ 見てくれないの?
私だけを愛せないの?
届かない届かない 傍にいるのに
手を伸ばしたら消えちゃいそうで…

ただ好きだから。",Sukidakara.

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

To being me consolation, you're my inspiration

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

Benita Hill,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

Puis la voilà murène, passés les coups de reins

Et puis après, elle fait la morte
Elle agite ses breloques et de gîtes en remorques

Benjamin Biolay,"Je me souviens d'un coin de rue
Aujourd'hui disparu
Mon enfance jouait par là
Je me souviens de cela
Il y avait un' palissade
Un taillis d'embuscades
Les voyous de mon quartier
Venaient s'y batailler

À présent il y a un café
Un comptoir tout neuf qui fait de l'effet
Une fleuriste qui vend ses fleurs aux amants
Et même aux enterrements

Je revois mon coin de rue
Aujourd'hui disparu

Je me souviens d'un triste soir
Où le cœur sans espoir
Je pleurais en attendant
Un amour de quinze ans
Un amour qui fut perdu
Juste à ce coin de rue

Et depuis j'ai beaucoup voyagé
Trop souvent en pays étrangers
Mondes neufs constructions et démolitions
Vous me donnez des visions

Je crois voir mon coin de rue
Et soudain apparus
Je revois ma palissade
Mes copains mes glissades
Mes deux sous de muguet de printemps
Mes quinze ans… mes vingt ans
Tout ce qui fut et qui n'est plus
Tout mon vieux coin de rue.",Coin de rue
Benjamin Biolay,"Le Grand Café

Au Grand Café vous entrez par hasard
Tout ébloui par les lumières du boul'vard
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous avez bu, quelle soif indomptable
De beaux visages fardés vous disaient bonsoir
Et la caissière se levait pour mieux vous voir
Vous étiez beau vous étiez bien coiffé
Vous avez fait beaucoup d'effet
Beaucoup d'effet au Grand Café.

Comme on croyait que vous étiez voyageur
Vous avez dit des histoires d'un ton blagueur
Bien installé devant la grande table
On écoutait cet homme intarissable
Tous les garçons jonglaient avec Paris-Soir
Et la caissière pleurait au fond d'son tiroir
Elle vous aimait, elle les aurait griffés
Tous ces gueulards, ces assoiffés

Ces assoiffés du Grand Café

Par terre on avait mis de la sciure de bois
Pour que les cracheurs crachassent comme il se doit
Bien installé devant la grande table
Vous invitiez des Ducs, des Connétables
Quand on vous présenta, soudain, l'addition
Vous avez déclaré : Moi, j'ai pas un rond
Cette phrase-là produit un gros effet
On confisqua tous vos effets
Vous étiez fait au Grand Café.

Depuis ce jour, depuis bientôt soixante ans
C'est vous l'chasseur, l'commis de restaurant
Vous essuyez toujours la grande table
C'est pour payer cette soirée lamentable
Ah, vous eussiez mieux fait de rester ailleurs
Que d'entrer dans ce café plein d'manilleurs
Vous étiez beau, le temps vous a défait
Les mites commencent à vous bouffer

Benjamin Biolay,"Le vieux piano de la plage ne joue qu'en fa qu'en fatigué
Le vieux piano de la plage possède un la qui n'est pas gai
Un si cassé qui se désole
Un mi fané qui le console
Un do brûlé par le grand soleil du mois de juillet
Mais quand il joue pour moi les airs anciens que je préfère

Un frisson d'autrefois
M'emporte alors dans l'atmosphère
D'un grand bonheur dans une petite chambre
Mon joli cœur du mois de septembre
Je pense encore encore à toi
Do mi si la

Le vieux piano de la plage ne joue qu'en sol en solitude
Le vieux piano de la plage a des clients dont l'habitude
Est de danser samedi dimanche
Les autres jours seul sur les planches
Devant la mer qui se souvient il rêve sans fin
C'est alors que je sors tout courbatu

De ma cachette
Et que soudain dehors tremblant, ému,
Devant lui j' m'arrête
Et c'est inouï tout ce que je retrouve
Comme cette musique jolie m'éprouve
Me fait du mal me fait du bien
Je n'en sais trop rien

Adieu, adieu piano tu sais combien peuvent être cruelles
Ces notes que tu joues faux mais dans mon cœur ouvrant ses ailes
S'éveille alors la douce rengaine
De mon heureux sort ou de mes peines
Lorsque tu tapes, tapes, toute la semaine mais le samedi
Quand les jeunesses débarquent
Tu sais alors brigand de la plage
Que ton souvenir les marque
Et qu'un beau soir passé l'bel âge
Un autre que moi devant la piste s'arrêtera là et sera triste

Un paysage si bien caché 
Et dans un nuage le cher visage

What is it about relationships that we don't get?
Here we are always thinking we've learnt only to get smacked and realise we are but mere students of life
And feels like
We've been fighting a lost battle
To have always realise at the end of it all
It feels like
We've been brought to a royal banquet, just to be served a brew and a wretched floor

Where snow fall is the norm as opposed to the ray of sunlight but,

And so maybe he's gone, he's gone wondering around looking for his kind of star 
But even stars 
if we think about, even beautiful stars 
They tend to shoot through the night and you will never find them again!

Benjamin Clementine,"(He chants)
 
If I held my breath on you, 
I will die a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would have probably be wearing dentures by now
 
If I held my breath on you, 
I will die a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would have probably be wearing dentures by now
 
Promises broken
Nemesis our token
Turned around and marched on out to a new home
Oh but wherever you've gone darling 
Don’t forget to 

Treat others the way, you wanna be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

(He chants march on)
 
If you held your breath on me
You would have died a million times
And if chewing was to show me how much I cared
You would have probably swallowed your tongue by now
 
All am trying to say is that you know very well that I left her for you
Now I guess you are doing the same old same thing to me now 
 
These days Hennessy dries my veins
Whilst our genesis flies back at me
Now Heresy might be your new faith, faith
But whatever you believe in
Make sure you never forget to

Treat others the way, you wanna be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

Treat others the way, you will want to be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

Can’t say anything for you no more
Nemesis is on your case baby
Next time!
Treat others the way you will want to be treated
Else there will be punishment 
Ohh and there she comes
Life ain’t a bitch, 
Nemesis is
And she is the mother of Karma

So long you run",Nemesis

Benjamin Francis Leftwich,"Take me to the docks, there's a ship without a name there
And it is sailing to the middle of the sea
The water there is deeper than anything you've ever seen
Jump right in and swim until you're free

I will remember your face
'Cause I am still in love with that place
But when the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

Money came like rain to your hands while you were waiting
For that cold long promise to appear
People in the churches started singing above their hands
They say, ""My God is a good God and He cares""

I will remember your face
'Cause I am still in love with that place
When the stars are the only things we share
Will you be there?

Crystal ball
Fell down onto my head

If I want it I pay
My true love
Well she threw it away
CHORUS
But I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
I can shine it all on
And still be amazed
Had some money
And a hole in my pocket
Had a house
But I forgot to lock it
Took a drag
>From a smoke that may kill me
What a drag
How the winter wind chills me
CHORUS
I'll shine it on just like MacBeth
In the face of certain death
Of a salesman or a king
And when the palm trees are on fire
I'll take my boat out on the sea
Had a face
But I never could save it
Hada kid
But I never would name it
Have a life
Well, that's what they call it
It's a road

I've been waiting for the summer to come
So I wait here
Waiting for the light of the sun
I've been waiting for the summer to come

And I started to believe in the hope of better days
Then the wind changed in the garden
And the darkness went away

Benjamin Legrand,"How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name?
I know the way I feel for you it's now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck then I suppose
The music never ends
I know, the way I feel for you

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Benjamin Sears,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

We are gathered here today 
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time

There's something else
The after world

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana 
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited 
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Spiritless hands show no caress. There was no embrace from tearstained faces.
Environment bottomless compassion was motionless.
Weary eyes will only see the depths of captivity here in this perpetual misery.
Hate's piercing sound disfigures the soul in the stream of my tears
I lay in their mold!

Do you got any love in your heart? Unfeeling! Unfeeling! Unfeeling!
I touched my innermost self with its healing.
Threw myself down at the feet of its mercy
the stone of my heart met its defeat love emptied me filling me with serenity.
It's a light that want to embrace me,
I was not of love still it accepted me whole
and where there was nothing left there is love in the soul. Love is not weakness!
Love is power!
Love is truth!
Love is endless!
Love is your forgiveness!
Love is your sacrifice!
Love is your faith!
Love is your trust!

Non si accontenta di niente
Che non si sente mai importante
Come una goccia in mezzo ad un mare di gente,
Dov'è nascosta la felicità? 
E chiuso dentro al suo mondo 
Guarda dalla finestra
La vita scorrere senza di lui 
E sempre a farsi problemi, per gli altri
Senza nemici con troppi rimpianti per
Essere vero
Essere serio si ritrova solo forse perché è troppo sincero, sai
Che forse quell'uomo a volte sembro io
Stanco di pregare, io

Una risposta a tutti questi perché
Ma forse è tempo di pensare per me
Sarà il momento di cambiare 

Questa è la storia di chi si mette sempre da parte
Non ha il coraggio di combattere 
E chiuso nella sua stanza
Pensa quanto sia facile mollare tutto ed andarsene 
E da un aereo guardare una vita di
Pochi sorrisi ed è pronto a convincermi
Che anche se non lo voglio sono come lui
Sempre perso nei cazzi miei 

Tutte le volte che
Mi vien da ridere, ma senza un perché

Mi vien da ridere, ma senza un perché
Sarà che quando mi ricordo di te
È sempre tempo di cambiare anche se
Non posso credere che vada così
Non è una vita, forse vivo in un film
E forse è tempo di cambiare
Tempo di non pensarci più

Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",

When at first your kiss I decline.

And I held it in my hand
I wished it lots of luck as I
Gave it to the homeless man

I said God bless us both

Touch my heart it is open
Kiss my soul if you're willing

Today I had a notion I had
To call up my old friend
She said she had a
Poem for me
And did I hear that
She was thinking of leaving
I said I will miss you
And then
I played her my new song
We laughed and cried
We never said goodbye
And when I called again
She was gone

Here and now
Ready and willing
Touch my heart it is open
Kiss my soul if you're willing
I am ready to be living
Here and now

Today I made a dollar and
I'm feeling very rich
I earned it with my labor
Yes I dug my ditch
I'm free from all my worries
And I cast away my doubts
I am living in this moment
And tomorrow's gonna

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Those ants that invaded my pants, finis

I'll try to love
Now I still cling

Will the night bring
Another to me?

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me 
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring
Will my heart awake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Love in some other spring?

Benny Carter,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Benny Carter,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go
All around I go, in a spin
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro

And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight

And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you

Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather

Got so hot we had to cool it

assisting at an unexpected borning

Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Benny Carter,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Benny Carter,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know
Benny Carter,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Benny Carter,"Sugar, I call my baby my sugar
I never maybe my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
He's special ration
Funny, he never asks for my money
All I give him is honey
And that he can spend anytime

I'd make a million trips to lips
It I were a bee
Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me
He's confectionery

Sugar, I never cheat on my Sugar
Cause I'm too sweet on my Sugar
That sugar baby of mine",Sugar
Benny Carter,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Benny Carter,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

Benny Carter,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

Love flew out again

You will relieve the only soul

Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,

We've got the world and all it's charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms

Always have the blues a little

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

It is seldom that a dream comes true

And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile; I'll understand
And in a little while he'll take my hand

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You
Benny Goodman,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show

Benny Goodman,"'S wonderful, 's marvelous
You should care for me
'S awful nice, 's paradise

You've made my life so glamorous
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

That you should care for me

'S wonderful, 's marvelous
That you should care for me

Benny Goodman,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains 
And eat an apple every day then see
The doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

Benny Goodman,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Send back my love

We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Benny Goodman,"From Seven Lively Arts
 Every time we say goodbye I die a little.
 Every time we say goodbye I wonder why a little,
 Why the gods above me, who must be in the know,
 Think so little of me they allow me to go.
 When you're near there's such a joy of spring about it.
 I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it.
 there's no love song finer,
 But how strange the change from major to minor
 Every time we say goodbye.
 Every single time we say goodbye

When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin' my fear apart
And that laugh..wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Benny Goodman,"There's an empty place inside that is hurting me
A place that keeps my heart out on it's own
A disconnected function of my wretchedness
That keeps me so hard pressed 
It's a place where words are spoken you
Will never hear
A broken bridge of lines that just won't come
An empty lung that won't give the wind
To speak at me
How far can it be from home

Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need
So why you gotta be so mean to me

Do you think that it got up and left
For good this time
A crowd of faceless strangers moving on
A feeling that you left it all behind you now
That it doesn't hurt somehow
To know

Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need
So why you gotta be so mean to me

So open up the book that you keep deep inside
Let the pages yellow in the sun
Show them that you're not afraid to let them see
How far you can be From home

Why you gotta drag me down just to make me see
You know I don't listen good and I'm always in need

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant

Sighing sigh after sigh

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Take a little,
Let your poor heart break a little.

Cry a little,
Let the clouds roll by a little.

Benny Goodman,"I'm in the middle of solving a riddle that no one can do;
That goes for Albert Einstein, the League of Nations too,
So now my fine and feathered friend,
I'll leave it up to you.

If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, 
How much do I love you?
Then what have I got to pick to turn the trick
And make you love me too?

If Simple Simon sat beside a shallow saucer
Tryin' to catch a whale
Then what have I got to try to make you buy
The heart I've got for sale?

How much wood would a wood-chuck chuck
If a wood-chuck could chuck wood?
I'd chuck double with no trouble
If it did me any good
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd pick a peck of peppers
Sit beside a saucer
I'd even be a wood-chuck 
Chuck-in all I could chuck
Just to make you love me too.

Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start All over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Benny Goodman,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Benny Goodman,"Give me a song that's robust
Feeling the way I am
Any old band'll go bust
If it ain't got that jam

When a body needs a body
On the ballroom floor
Then a body asks a body
""What's a swing band for?""

To croon soft and mellow
Let me warn you in advance
Sing me a swing song and let me dance

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Benny Goodman,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Benny Goodman,"Oh, you can't pull the wool over my eyes.

So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Benny Goodman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Benny Goodman,"YOU TURNED THE TABLES ON ME
Benny Goodman

I used to be the apple of your eye
I had yo with me every day,
But now whenever you are passing by 
You're always looking the other way
It's little things like this
That prompt me to say:

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you;
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me.",You Turned the Tables on Me
Benny Goodman,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that so but I tried to go

I passed a shadowy lane and I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream

Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream
At every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue

There's a change in the sea

But I'm goin' to let the old things be
'Cause they are certainly not suited for me
There was a time when I thought that way
That's why I'm all alone here, today
Since everyone of these days seeks something new
From now on I'm goin' to seek some new things too

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)
Benny Goodman,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love
Benny Goodman,"Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road

Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Benny Goodman,"Night and stars above that shine so bright

Across the sand so I may keep

Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Benny Goodman,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Benny Goodman,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

Benny Goodman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain",Stardust on the Moon
Benny Goodman,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean

Somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue.

Some others I've seen,
Might never mean.
Might never be cross,

Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.

Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.

Just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew.
But to be so near you,
Thrills me through and through.

Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you Could love me, Louise?


Innocent! You're so innocent
And gentle as a dove.
Heaven sent! You were heaven sent,
An angel from above.

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one-track mind of mine
I can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in

A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye

I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly

Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí",Frenesi

And took it to the market

Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.

Benny Goodman,"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME

(Deborah Allen - Rafe VanHoy - Don Cook)

You only get around to me when someone else has said goodbye
Somehow you only want the ones who noly going to make you cry
It seems no matter what you do you never get their loving affection
It should be obvious to you you're looking in the wrong direction

What's the matter with me
What do I have to do to make you see
Just how good it could be
If it's really love that you need
What's the matter with me

When you're lying in my arms waiting for your heart to feel
How can you be so close to me and not know the way I feel
You say it makes you feel so good to know you can cry on my shoulder
I must really be a fool to let it happen over and over

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Benny Goodman,"Paradise can not refuse us
Never such a happy pair

Everybody must excuse us
If we walk on air

All the shadows now will lose us
Lucky stars are everywhere

As a happy being
Here's what I'm foreseeing

For you, for me, forever more
It's bound to be forever more

It's plain to see
We found, by finding each other
The love we waited for

I'm yours, you're mine
And in our hearts
The happy ending starts

What a lovely world
This world will be
With a world of love in store
For you, for me, forever more.

Where I may find
there are hearts more kind
Than I leave behind.

I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.

Of this sly biological urge.
But it really was Cole
Who contrived to make the whole
Thing merge.

He said the Belgians and Greeks do it
Nice young men who sell antiques do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Monkeys whenever you look do it,
Aly Khan and King Farouk do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
Louella Parsons can't quite do it,

Marlene might do it,
But she looks far too young.
Each man out there shooting crap does it,
Davy Crockett in that dreadful cap does it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Our famous writers in swarms do it,
Somerset and all the Maughams do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.
The Brontes felt that they must do it,
Ernest Hemingway could-just-do it,
Let's do it, let's fall in love.

Each temptation that lures us along
Is just Nature elle-meme

Others drill a hole-and then do it,

A fairground's faded swings

Benny Green,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Benny Green,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Oh, gather in the mushrooms, put 'em in a pot,
Pop 'em in the oven an serve 'em piping ho-ot.

She said, ""I'll have a bathful,"" to her milkman Jackie Wilke.
He said, ""Do you want it pasturized before I pour it in?""
She said, ""No, I'll be happy if it comes up to my chin.""

""There's snow upon the roof but there's a fire in the cellar!""

Oh, gather in the mushrooms, put 'em in a pot,

But you was in the ladies' excuse me at the time,
I thought I would never have a chance.

And I knew that with you I should be a hit,

In my horse and buggy one day,

And when the daylight ends and the night descends,

I have a wooden head

I?d like to take her transistor radio
And throw it in the deep blue sea
I?m so jealous of her transistor radio
?Cause it takes her mind off me
I said, Oh baby, please be mine

Tell me, is your love for somebody else?
Or is it for me alone?

And love her all the while

But baby, tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go

And your heart it already knows

Don't you cry 'cause I can't stand the pain
You and I, we can have it all again, again

You say you fell in love with a man who made you feel
Like you were the only one
At first he bought you all kinds of expensive things
And then he hurt you, hurt you, hurt you

You're starting to see
Everything, everything you ever wanted in a man
Baby, is looking right at you
You said nobody loves you but baby I do

Oh babe, tonight my life's on the line
And I can't let you go

Don't you cry 'cause I can't stand the pain

Tonight while the world is sleeping
While the Gods are keeping watch over you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Benny Waters,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends [#]
Benny Waters,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When [#]
Benny Waters,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Benny Waters,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Benny Waters,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Benny Waters,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Benny Waters,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Elle me roule une vraie paloche
Bon j'suis d'accord pour être un peu en retard
J'cavale en philo, table sacrée
Près de la fenêtre
Je les laisse cogiter
Sur l'être et le non-être

Me souffle un air de chlorophylle

J'sais pas si elle devient
Ma 50ème gonzesse ou

Prénom sur l'avant bras

De faire ça au compas

Je peux pas faire un seul pas
Sans faire un calembour
Il arrive encore qu'un prof
Me jette hors du cours

Et j'aime un trop les fous rires
Peut-être parce que je suis gosse
Dans tous mes souvenirs

N'empêche que des larmes coulent
Des coins de chaque oeil
Quand la solitude vient faire
Ses griffes sur ma grande gueule
Seul à seul avec moi
J'ai un stylo au bout des doigts
J'écris et je voudrais
Que ça s'arrête jamais

Le temps est dans les fous rires
Sous les saules pleureurs
Et contre les fenêtres
J's'rai écrivan peut-être

Benoît Dorémus,"Autour de lui on s’est dit qu'c’était pas une racaille
Apres tout on l’a pas flingué sur la rocaille
Ça va s’en dire mais il a fait un temps de chiotte
Le jour où j ai béni le cercueil de mon pote

On a été ennemis, j’y ai repensé sous la pluie
Mais qui l’a pas était parmi ceux autour de lui
Tôt ou tard? Déjà la veille partait Philippe Léotard
T’étais pareil: paumé, maudit, mais t’étais une star

En 5ème D y fumait des clopes aux cours de maths
Des spliffs à la récré, moi, j'crapotais deux lattes
A cet enterrement tout a refait surface
J’oublierai ni ta voix ni tes yeux ni ta face

Ça fait chialer quand à 20 ans quelqu’un s’en va
Mais il faut dire aussi qu’on est pas fait pour ça
Dieu, le vrai paradis c’est quand on était enfant
Ton paradis Christian on va foutre le boxon dedans

Attends-toi à de la baston, y en aura, pas de doute
Attends-toi à voir tous tes anges bourrés jouer au foot
Autour de lui, attends-toi à le voir tenter le diable
T’es prévenu, Christian, il est irrémédiable

Pourvu que t'aimes Bob Marley autant que la joie et la paix
Ce serait dommage qu'il est à imposer son respect
Autour de lui on fait sur soi quand on l’a contre soi
Par contre crois-moi t’es fier quand il est fier de toi

Il m’a appris à faire des bulles de salive qui volent
Y a longtemps, du temps d'nos blâmes de conduite à l’école
Y avait autour de lui dans les bulles qui s’envolaient
L’ art de vivre que j’interprète un peu maintenant qu’ il est...

Toujours avoir sur soi de quoi payer l’amende
Toujours avoir du feu quand on te le demande
Et s'il te vient parfois des phrases pas trop moches
Alors toujours avoir un stylo dans la poche

Et essayer pourquoi pas d’être un bon écrivain
Se foutre du sommet, se foutre du ravin
Etre seul au besoin, assumer, être digne
Lire la ligne a Léo puis aller à la ligne

Des points cardinaux, ne jamais perdre le sud
Etre insolent et promettre de perdre l’habitude
Etre un mauvais exemple, mais suivre une bonne étoile
S’amuser à faire chier l'araignée sur sa toile

Se sentir bien partout, nulle part, être déphasé
Noter des trucs partout, pour s’immortaliser
Pas se pointer aux exams, et être satisfait
Enfin quoi, me dis pas que tu l’as jamais fait

Bien sûr que je tiens plus que tout a la vie qui continue
Maintenant que je vois des trucs invisibles à l’œil nu
J’embrasse deux fois plus Léo, je donne un peu, j'écoute
J’ai tendance à rouler au milieu de la route

J’oubliais, soûler mais rendre heureuse la fille que t’aimes
Moi c'est Léo, je permets pas qu’on rende heureuse la même
Tu sais Léo, souvent je me marre tout seul à haute voix
Je te cherche des yeux pour rire avec toi.",Les Bulles

Renaud qui déboule quand ma vie
Faut voir de quelle manière!
Renaud qui déroule un tapis
Sous ma petite carrière
Quand tu connais l'histoire
Y a de quoi tomber par terre

J'ai quand même eu la loose
Bien collée à la peau
Je me suis bien flanqué le blues
Collé à France Info
J'ai quand même eu le flouze
Bien planqué sous zéro
J'ai divisé par 12 mes bonnes blagues
Et mes conseils aux poteaux

""Vos chansons je dis bravo
Benito, ça m'a grave plu
Mais ça ressemble grave à Renaud...""
Tous les jours c'est ce qu'il a fallu
Que je me tape mot pour mot
C'est pas que j'voulais lâcher
Juste que j'allais crever
Ou mourir tout au plus

Dans le parcours, tout doucement,
J'ai perdu ma gonzesse
Le stress nous a trop longtemps
Bandé dans les fesses
La vie qu'on voulait rose
On l'a eue rose P.Q
On voulait vivre mille choses
On a à peine survécu

Un couple ça tient pas la misère
Et encore moins à Paname
Et face à mes mille colères
Ca tient pas, une bonne femme
S'en fout que je sois disque d'or
Mais pas disque noir
Faut que je vous dise que je dors
En boxant mes cauchemars

Me confie une vieille guitare

Va lui refiler de ma part
Et refile-lui ton album
J'arrive face au bonhomme
Je lui remets l'objet rare
Et aussi la guitare

Mouais, il le soupèse un peu
Mon pe tit autoproduit
(Parenthèse, merci à tous ceux
Qui me connaissent pas d'aujourd'hui)
Le v'là qui lit les paroles
Rallume une cigarette
Benito surveille son idole
Comme une vieille chouette

Ca vaut tous les dollars
Ce que j'ai entendu dire
Par le mec au foulard
Par le maître à écrire
Se faire appeler Petit con
Parler de moi dans son bar
Paname m'a vu me pavaner
Ce jour-là tu peux me croire

Alors j'ai fréquenté un peu
L'absurdité suprême
Le matin à l'ANPE
Et avec toi l'aprèm
Ou encore pendant que je tombe
Sur le répondeur de mon ex
C'est sur le mien que tu laisses
Des messages de 10 plombes!

Trop content qu'on soit deux
Dans mon égotrip
Renaud comme producteur, mon Dieu
Mais comme c'est romantique!
Toi la star, moi le charclo
Réunis par Sarclo
J'allais me démerder sans
Mais c'est mieux avec toi!

Ceux qui m'ont pris pour un flingue
Vachement bien imité
Tous ceux qui m'ont rendu dingue
Je vais les laisser comparer
Je sais ce que tu vas me dire
Parle pas trop vite, gamin!
C'est pas que je parle trop vite
C'est eux qui disent plus rien!",Deux dans Mon Egotrip (Acte 3)
Benoît Dorémus,"J'ai enlevé mes pompes sous la table
J'ai mis ma tête entre mes bras
Je viens d'exploser mon portable
Je me mords la lèvre du bas
Je suis fatigué, je veux voir personne
Dehors j'entends des rires de connes
Je vais les tuer si je ferme pas la fenêtre
Ma mère pourrait pas me reconnaître
Je ressemble à moi-même dans 20 ans
Je traverse l'enfer, métaphoriquement

J'ai eu ce coup de fil d'un type que j'ai
Pas vu depuis des années, il est
Tout content d'avoir vu ma gueule
En tapant mon nom dans Google
Ce type qu'en plus j'aimais même pas
A pognon, maison et tout ça
Consultant, chef de projet de mes deux
Ça me fait mal de le sentir heureux
""Eh ! m'oublie pas quand tu seras une star!""
Je t'aurai oublié bien avant ça connard!

C'est quoi cette vocation maudite?
Je suis même pas un bon chanteur
J'ai dû être un sacré pauvre type
Dans une damnée vie antérieure
Avec ma paie je me gratte le cul
Choisir entre bouffe et loyer
Pas le quart de ce qu'il aurait fallu
Ouais c'est la merde qu'est-ce tu croyais!
L'écriture n'est plus mon amour
Mais une fleur puante que j'arrose tous les jours!

C'est dur de se dire qu'il y a autant de glands
Et que pourtant personne t'attend
C'est fou de se dire qu'en bossant dur
On devient fou tellement ça dure
Je me fous bien des malheurs du monde
Je veux une vie normale juste deux secondes
Il paraît que mes chansons réchauffent
Mais ce que ça me plairait une vie de beauf!
Que je pense à ceux qui dorment dehors?
Et puis quoi encore! Que je pense aux morts?

Je peux pas me projeter au-delà de demain
Concerts sur fond de papier peint
Sur fonds de poches, sur bruits de fond
Ceux qui font de la merde ont raison!
Moi aussi je veux qu'on m'aime, et d'une,
Et de deux je veux ma part de thunes
Alors j'essaye de me concentrer
Sur ceux qu'ont même pas à bouffer
Mais je n'arrive qu'à penser à ceux
Qui se prélassent

Je vis de quoi voter socialiste
Jusqu'à ma mort, et je porte ma croix
Mon existence est belle et triste
Comme de la neige qui tient pas
C'est sûr on nage en plein délire
Si faut être malheureux pour écrire
J'aimais autant rester lecteur...
Tiens, j'ai qu'à penser aux acteurs
Il paraît qu'ils en bavent autant
Que sur l'enfer ils en savent autant

Benito a mal à la tête
Il voudrait dormir juste six mois
Se réveiller sans aucune dette
Et qu'on lui rende ce qu'on lui doit
Je voudrais faire plaisir à voir
Quand je rends visite à mes potes
Je suis pas sûr de pas me mettre à boire
Et pourtant je n'aime que la flotte
Je vais chourer un portable au magasin du coin
Dire que tout finira par me sembler si loin
Dire que tout finira par me sembler si loin",L' Enfer (Acte 2)
Benoît Dorémus,"Excusez-moi j’ai dû sortir
Pour aller gerber
J’ai eu une vision d’avenir
Et ça m'a plombé
Me suis vu, comment dire...
Merdeux et salarié
J’ai vu à quoi ma vie
Pourrait bien ressembler
J’ai vu le bureau d’un chef
La machine à café
Les réunions, les bénefs
Et l’air climatisé
Une vie sans relief
Directement reliée
A la mort, enfin bref
Une vie à gerber

Y avait plus le héros
De mes rêves de gamin

Y avait plus qu’un blaireau
Sage au milieu des siens

J'envisage avec l'âge d'ouvrir la cage au passage au petit con pas sage qu'en fait j'ai toujours été!
Et sur lequel j'ai jamais eu le contrôle
Rien qu'à voir le boxon dans ma piaule...

Dis Léo, je me demande
Si tu prends pas un risque
A m’aimer, à me défendre
Avant mon premier disque
Toi tu me vois légende
C est un peu optimiste
Chérie si je me viande
J'ai peur que tu sois triste
Il se peut ma Léo
Que j’arrive à que dalle
Que je tombe K.O.
Sous les premières balles
Que tu tombes de haut
Sur ma pierre tombale

Ce serait, tu t’en doutes,
Que mes mots touchent quelqu’un
A part toi qui m’écoutes
Et deux ou trois copains
Ce serait qu'on me goûte
Et puis qu'on m’aime bien
Rien que ça, et j'ajoute
Qu’on me trouve beau! Hein?
Je rêve un peu? Faut pas?
Et j'fais quoi à la place?
Je fais comme eux, c’est ça?
Une petite vie sans trace?
Mais je pourrais plus marcher droit
Ni te sourire en face
Léo, écoute-moi
Je sais ce qu il faut que je fasse...

J'ai franchement pas dans l'idée de me rendre malade à crever, de me retrouver à faire comme le padre un métier que je peux pas encadrer!
J'envisage avec l'âge d'ouvrir la cage au passage au petit con pas sage qu'en fait j'ai toujours été!
Y a dix mille kilos de pression sur mes petites épaules
Mais rien qu'un en moins, rien qu'un, et ce serait pas drôle...

Il m’a fallu du temps
Pour expliquer aux vieux
Qu'ils m’ont mis dans le sang
De l’encre, et c’est tant mieux
Je peux plus vivre sans
Ou alors malheureux
Ils ont compris, maintenant
Faut que j’y arrive, nom de Dieu!
Regardez bien, je deviens
Un putain de chanteur
Une saloperie d’écrivain
Et mon propre employeur
En baver? Faudra bien
Mais ça me fait même pas peur
Moins que le quotidien
Qu'on me propose ailleurs
J'emmerde comme il se doit
Les donneurs de conseils
Du style ""Petit, crois-moi
Je suis un vieux de la vieille
Il faut faire ci, dire ça
Si tu veux que ça paye!""
Et je lève bien haut mon doigt
A tous ceux qui essayent
Et à ceux qu’essayeront
De faire dévier ma route
J'écoute ni les cons
Ni les autres, dans le doute
Tout seul, c’est peut-être plus long
Mais je sais ce que ça coûte
Je sais ce que ça me coûte
Et c’est un chèque à mon nom!

On est pas si nombreux à avoir la gaule
On peut baiser la vie à tour de rôle...

Rapport à mon envie de faire que ça est grandissante
Rapport à tous les mots qui sortent et qui se jettent
Dans mon micro ou sur 21 29,7

Y a un truc à savoir avant d'aller plus loin
Je prends deux minutes pour insister sur ce point
C'est pas pour faire le coq, mais je voudrais faire taire
Ceux qui voudraient déjà me faire des commentaires

Ce que j'écris ça r'garde que moi
J'aime trop les taches que ça laisse sur les doigts
Ce que je chante, que personne y touche

Certains jours où le monde me revient qu'à moitié
Je me réfugie sur une feuille de papier
D'autres jours où il est un peu trop grand pour moi

Je suis pote avec des mots pourtant infréquentables

Et je suis certain que vous saisissez la nuance

Benoît Dorémus,"J'aime pas apprendre j'aime savoir, je suis pas un mec qui retient les leçons, j'apprends rien je suis un con, je vis sur mes acquis et mes acquis c'est pas les bons. Mon cerveau coince par endroits, quelque chose a dû cramer dans l'hemisphère droit. Comme la jeter par la fenêtre cent fois mentalement, quand elle cause à des gens et que des gens lui causent, je chronomètre, j'implose, j'attends, c'est pas ce que je sais faire de plus intelligent, j'ai l'hémisphère gauche au courant. Mais elle trouve qu'on peut frôler la main d'un type par accident, ça signifie rien pour autant, trois fois de suite non plus bien sûr, y a rien de louche, ça arrive tout le temps, tout le temps, tu m'enlèves les mots de la bouche c'est troublant. Ils ont les yeux sur ton cul mais tu vois pas le rapport, nan? Rien que moi je le mate à mort et je le connais pourtant. Je veux plus entendre parler de ça, je veux plus parler de ça, je veux plus de ça. Mais je suis hônnete au moins tu peux pas m'enlever ça. Soulève n'importe quel mot, coucou, la jalousie est planquée dessous, la petite salope me saute au cou, elle serre fort et je vois flou. J'essaie de fuir mais je te jure que c'est pas facile à genoux. Elle demande mine de rien: avant moi y en a eu combien? Est-ce qu'on peut compter ces gens sur les doigts d'une seule main? T'en penses quoi t'y penses quand? Pourquoi tu t'en souviens? Les questions, les réponses, la petite prend tout en main, au besoin la petite salope est aussi plutôt douée en dessin. Et elle a de la mémoire. Elle voudrait savoir, c'était quoi l'autre soir cet air que t'avais en partant, en rentrant, j'ai comme senti flotter un truc qui flotte pas normalement. Comme je te le demande pas c'est elle qui m'en fait voir. J'ai les images en mouvement, le son, tout, les gros plans, derrière, devant, mon orgueil champ/contrechamp. Je sens que tout le monde me voit, j'essaye de pas trop penser à la caméra.En société je fais ce que je peux pour cacher mon profil droit. Jaloux, moi? Vous plaisantez ou quoi? Tu rentres tard? On te raccompagnera? Est-ce qu'y a bien une capote dans ton sac à main? Fais-toi les ongles, j'ai fini les miens, je vais commencer à me bouffer les doigts. Tout va bien, n'est-ce pas?

Elle me dit et elle a raison
La jalousie est un poison
Qui rend con

Un poison lent qui flingue les nerfs
Tout ceux qui pensent que j'exagère
Je baise leur mère

Elle me dit pendant que je dégueule
La jalousie ne rend tout seul
Que ceux qui le veulent

J'm'étouffe en beuglant ""c'est pas vrai""
Je suis né avec et j'en crèverai
Si ce n'est fait...

Paraît que c'est la façon que j'ai de me dire à moi-même que je m'aime pas, mais j'y crois pas, je me passerais bien d'un détail ou deux quoi, ça s'arrête là. Quel merdier. Je m'endors le dernier, les mâchoires serrées comme un cadavre froid. Arrête! Arrête? Comment veux-tu que j'arrête! Est-ce qu'on pourrait parler d'autre chose? Comment veux-tu qu'on parle d'autre chose? Le mal est fait, le mot est faible, chérie. J'ai déjà bien tapé dans mon espérance de vie. Les prénoms du passé mettent du plomb dans tout ce que je bouffe, les coups de fil qui font chier, presque tous, du sang dans ce que je tousse, c'est tes histoires, ça me regarde pas c'est ça? Faut que je le respecte, c'est précieux? Jardin secret de mes deux! Mais c'est la vie, bah oui, t'as ton jardin aussi, bah oui, un rien plus petit, mais la tolérance, je suis à peine en train d'apprendre comment ça se danse et je retiens pas les pas alors je balance à bout portant des propos talibans. Vite, vite, trouve-moi un truc pour taper dedans. Mais téléphone pas en t'éloignant, t'éloigne pas en téléphonant, te marre pas ils sont pas marrants. Nan j'ai pas été humilié quand j'étais gosse, pas d'épisode atroce pour expliquer le raisonnement. Tu vas chialer? Nan! Mais si, en me parlant de confiance. Je vais m'excuser ""ça va me passer tu sais"", un peu de patience, quelques réglages, c'est encore de mon âge, ""ça va me passer tu sais, c'est juste que je m'y ferai jamais"". Cette certitude me fout une chiasse d'enfer. Elle me manque l'époque où je savais faire celui que ton passé intéresse, y m'intéressait même beaucoup, je savais pas qu'il me rendrait fou, le stress que ce serait mon Dieu si j'étais pas un bon coup! Tout ce que t'as dit je l'ai enregistré et je l'utilise contre toi. T'as rien dit de mal y paraît mais la petite salope démord pas, elle m'dit ouais, qui te dit qu'elle est où elle a dit qu'elle allait, peut-être bien qu'elle est en train de baiser à l'heure qu'il est...

Elle me dit et je dis non, sans déc'
La jalousie me rend infect
Et tout sec

J'ai un sourire qui signifie
Passe une jourée dans ma folie
J'te défie

Elle me dit et je fais le sourd
La jalousie c'est pas de l'amour
Je me goure

Benoît Dorémus,"Vous trouvez pas qu’on étouffe, ici ? Non ? Alors ça vient d’moi ? On dirait qu’y fait cent degrés mais vous avez raison, ça s’peut même pas. C’est la faute aux pensées qui montent et à mon p’tit cœur qui suit pas. 

Y m’fout la honte à battre la samba, ça m’prend comme ça, paf, putain crise d’angoisse, le sismographe en panique, douze litres de sueur qui poisse, sauf si ça non plus ça s’peut même pas ? Malaise vagal mental 

J’trimballe dans ma poche partout et par tous les temps un Xanax anti-pétoche, rose et rassurant. J’croque dedans, tac, discrétos dans les dents, j’attends qu’son goût dégueulasse fasse l’effet que j’en attends.

Quand j’peux plus faire face, quand j’sais plus c’qui s’passe, à la ramasse à la fois brûlant et tout blanc, un p’tit tour de chimie, un p’tit tour de magie, des molécules se battent à notre place, comment y f’saient avant ?

Ben quoi les gars on va quand même pas s’priver d’la science non ? Flippés ok mais pas trop cons. Passés du Néolithique aux anxiolytiques, on fait plus la chasse, non, mais on prend des cach’tons. 

Et je m’dis que j’m’inquiète pour rien
Et j’gobe 20 mg tous les matins 
Et je m’dis que j’m’inquiète pour rien
Dans mon immeuble à faire pareil, on est combien ?

« Qu’est-ce que la crainte de la misère, sinon la misère elle-même ? ». Voilà une saine pensée comme je les aime, mais moi j’ai pas la sagesse de Khalil Gibran, je stresse, j’ai c’putain de p’tit vélo dans l’crâne.

Rien à faire quand t’es dans cet état, t’es en enfer et j’me ramasse tous les matins à la p’tite cuillère, les gars j’ai pu d’nerfs et moins d’appétit qu’un barracuda, vas-y Bouddha, essaye de n’avoir pas souffert. 

Des nœuds dans l’cerveau, la tête entre les coudes, j’porte le monde sur mes épaules comme dans Hey Jude ! On klaxonne, je sursaute. Allez, démarrage en côte. Qu’est-ce qu’on va faire de moi quand tout sera devenu ma faute ? 

Y en a, ça s’voit, j’vous jure, ils ont pas même pas peur. Mon Dieu, j’donnerais une couille pour être des leurs, débouler dans la vie, tel un kéké sur un jetski, badaboum, peu d’abus, pas d’habits, tout dans l’regard… j’me vois d’ici. 

Moi si jamais on m’dit qu’on m’aime, pourquoi tout c’que j’entends c’est « T’es qu’une merde ! » Mais j’avance en séance avec mon psy, j’suis pas tout seul à être tout seul, je l’ai enfin compris. 

REFRAIN

Si y avait moins d’connards, si y avait moins d’horreurs, j’suis tout bouffé d’complexes mais le contexte m’écœure. J’vis dans un téléphone plus intelligent qu’moi, quand il est sur vibreur, putain je suis sur marteau-piqueur. 

J’essaie de mettre des beignes à mon désespoir. J’démêle le vrai du faux, même le contradictoire, j’ai ma vie cognitive, ma psychanalyse, « Tenez bon, lâchez prise », j’aime bien qu’on m’le dise. 
 
Docteur, grosse prime si on m’bute ma déprime, si on m’la renvoie – bim ! - au fond des abîmes. J’veux plus retrouver un ch’veu d’cette pute sur mes futs. Jusqu’ici j’ai préféré être un enfant qu’un adulte.

C’était bien plus fastoche, les mains sur mon bicross, j’le vois maintenant qu’j’avance dans la crasse à coups d’pioche, maintenant que l’angoisse a pénétré mes méninges, oui tout à fait, un peu comme Ariel au cœur du linge.

J’déteste qu’on m’demande « Ouh la ! ça va, toi ? », et j’déteste qu’on s’inquiète pour moi. Qui qu’a tout bousillé mon plexus solaire ? Qui qu’a mis « Peut mieux faire » sur mes bulletins scolaires ?

C'est toujours beau 
Avant que ça fonde 
Dix centimètres sur les balcons 
Et ça tombait encore à gros flocon 
Y'avait peu de monde et plus de bagnoles 
Que des braves gens sur leurs guibolles 
Alors j'ai mis ma tête sous mon bonnet 
Et j'suis descendu voir ça de plus près 
C'était bon de laisser mes empruntes avec mes petites pinces 
Pas bien profondes parce que j'suis tout mince 
J'ai patiné de ma porte devant 
Jusqu'au parc Georges Brassens 
Putain de Georges 
Je pensais à elle 
Est-ce qui y'avait autant de neige dans le dix-septième 
Est-ce que là-bas on batifole 
Est-ce qu'elle m'aimait encore 
Est-ce qu'elle était aux Batignolles 
Dans mes oreilles 
Eminem en boucle comme tous les jours de doute 
Marshall vas y prête moi ta haine 
Ta détresse c'est la mienne 
Putain de Georges 
J'soufflais ma buée dans les allées 
Quand à vingt mètres 
J'ai aperçu la statut du maître illustre 
Enfin son buste 
Avec sa moustache de marbre 
Auprès de son arbre 
Des gamins faisaient une bataille 
Et la neige collait bien 
J'me suis dit tu vas voir 
Je vais m'faire le Brassens en pleine poire 
Putain de Georges 
J'pensais l'avoir du premier coup 

Tous mes hivers mis bout à bout 
J'en ai lancé un bon paquet à mon neveu 
Je l'imaginais taper des gants 
Avec un petit rire amoureux 
Elle est partie ma boule de rage 
Dans le décor 
J'y avais mis tout mon cœur 
L'été d'avant au même endroit 
On s'était couché sur les fleurs 
Les boules suivantes pas tellement mieux 
J'me suis dit oh j'deviens bigleux 
Brassens gueulé olé olé 
Puis y'en a une qui la frôlé 
Alors il faisait le malin mais moins 
Les gosses rigolaient 
Elle en voulait plus mais moi j'en voulais 
Et avec ses yeux s'il vous plaît 
Putain de Georges 
Crevant d'orgueil j'ai canardé 
Zing zong en fermant un œil 
Et sans tricher sans m'approcher 
Donc digne face à l'échec 
Est ce qu'un peu elle pensait à moi 
Est ce qu'heureuse elle faisait avec 
Est ce qu'elle allait faire un bonhomme 
Avec son nouveau mec 
Putain de Georges 
Putain de Georges 
Putain de Georges 
Et puis paf le tire parfait 
Et le parc entier qui m'acclamait 
L’apothéose 
Ose me dire que tu m'aimes plus 
Ose 
J'ai pris mes quinze secondes de gloire 
Puis j'avais froid j'en ai eu marre 
Pars 
T'as tout gâché toute notre histoire 
Et moi j'l'ai eu Brassens 
En pleine poire",Brassens en pleine poire
Benoît Dorémus,"Elle m’a occupé
La moitié d’la tête
Et même l’autre moitié
Une année complète

Moi je suis du genre
À aimer si fort
Que même quand je dors
J’ai tout qui s’inquiète

L’amour, j’ai jamais pigé
C’est fait pour s’sentir léger
Moi c’est lourd que je le ressens
Mais c’est bien pire sans

Les regrets me montent
Quand je le raconte
Et puis la colère

J’vous entends déjà 
Me dire : y faut pas !
Je peux rien y faire

Elle a piraté
La moitié d’mon lit
M’a manipulé
Le corps et l’esprit






Moi je suis du genre
À m’avouer vaincu 
D’avoir tant vécu
En Tachycardie 

L’amour, la flèche dans la cible
C’est fait pour rendre invincible
Moi je fais que perdre mon sang
Mais c’est bien pire sans

On s’faisait trop d’peine
Pour nos p’tites trentaines
J’voulais d’la douceur

J’expliquais l’idée
La simplicité
Ça prenait des heures

On a bataillé
Pour l’histoire du verre
Rempli à moitié
Vide, si tu préfères

Moi je suis du genre
À faire un scandale
À la fin du bal
Quand tout dégénère

Que faire quand il vous repousse ?
Est-ce qu’il repasse, est-ce qu’il reprend ?

J'ai l'air de quoi

Non mais qu'est-ce que tu crois 
Et où est-ce-que tu te crois

J'ai pas eu le temps Laura 
Mais je te déteste déjà 
Et je t'en veux à mort 
J't'en veux à mort

J'ai pas mal au cœur mais à l'estomac 
On prend une minute non deux non minimum trois 
On explique un peu on sort le blabla 
Il est là pour ça 
On disparaît pas 
On dit 
J'ai même posé avec toi 
J'ai aimé parler on parlait n'est-ce pas 
On peut dire ce qu'on veut 
Puisqu'on s'en remettra 
On prend pas la fuite 
On fait un constat

Alors 

Me voilà planté comme un mauvais choix 
J'ai un vieux message ou j’entends ta voix 
Je l'écoute encore mais bientôt basta 
T'es qu'une petit caillera de 24 carats 
Je sais pas ce que j'ai fait mais ça m'apprendra 
Je sais pas ce que je croyais mais bon débarras 
J'ai fait deux petites croix dans mon agenda 
Une rouge et une bleu 
Souvenir d'un chaud froid 
Encore une semaine deux maximum trois 
Et je t'emportais partout avec moi 
J'allais presque croire à ma baraqua

Benoît Dorémus,"Dernièrement… Chlac !  Y a eu porte qui claque avec moi derrière, deux sacs dans les mains. Y a eu belle histoire qu’a eu sa fin moche, deux voix dans les poches, des larmes dans les coins. Dernièrement, dégoûté d’tout, j’ai douté d’tout, j’ai r’gardé partout, aimé presque rien, j’sentais mon cerveau paumer des p’tits bouts, c’était flippant comme le Néant dans « L’histoire sans fin ». 

Voilà les nouvelles
Quelques vains efforts, quelques victoires sur moi-même
Je secoue la tête et tout recommence alors
Avec mes défauts, avec des défaites
J’avance. Je crois qu’j’ai une petite chance 

Dernièrement, blême, j’ai fini deuxième aux Championnats du Monde de Cauchemars (à Kiev, en Ukraine). Battu d’une paupière par un slovène bizarre qui rêvait lui-même qu’y f’sait mes cauchemars. Dernièrement… Vlan ! J’ai foutu l’camp en m’abrutissant de questions profondes, j’ai fait l’tour du monde. J’ai changé d’gens, de vent, de rang, de gang, d’angle, de langue longtemps, pour semer mon ombre. J’ai couiné « Ben oui !» quand Souchon m’a dit « Tu la voyais grande et c’est une toute petite vie ». C’était même du sport de l’aimer encore, j’aurais voulu naître y’a cent ans pour être déjà mort !

REFRAIN

Dernièrement… Check mec ! J’ai serré la louche à des types honnêtes, j’ai fait des courbettes à des têtes nouvelles. J’ai connu des riches avec des problèmes de cons, j’ai connu des quiches avec des problèmes de ronds. 
J’ai changé d’lit mais pas d’amis, d’avis, mais pas d’utopie, j’ai maudit la main qui m’avait nourri. J’ai dit calmos à mes idées fausses, j’ai dit vamos, j’ai meilleur moral qu’à l’écrit. 
Dernièrement j’me suis dit « Benito, franchement, t’es barge, t’as d’la marge, t’es large finalement. Va puiser des forces dans la médiocrité, je t’assure, tu sais, t’as l’droit d’respirer. »

Que je pourrais me tailler les veines

Pour être de taille

Au lieu de flipper pour un rien 
Un rien un rien 
Je voulais me poser moins de question 
Ou moins souvent 
Pourquoi comment 
Les peurs antédiluviennes 
J'aurais trouvé ça si bon 
D’être au présent 
Moins oppressant 
De juste attendre que ça vienne 
Ca vienne ça vienne

Que j’ai découvert les plus grands
J’ai la chance que dans ma famille
Des bouquins y en avait tell’ment
 
J’en prenais un puis sur le trône
Je me posais deux heures de suite
Avant d’expédier dans le Rhône
Disons… l’objet de ma visite
 
Moi, les fourmis dans l’arrière-train
C’est un peu ma madeleine de Proust :
Moi, bienheureux au petit coin

Et Quick et Flüpke et Astrapi

Que j’ai rencontré Ugolin
Et tiré la chasse en pleurant

Pourtant j’me proposais d’leur faire
La lecture de derrière la porte
 

Y avait Céline et Maupassant
Pour m’éblouir et me distraire
Et quand vous êtes adolescent
Djian vous laisse le cul par terre

C’est avec le froc descendu
Que j’ai dû réviser mon bac
À la recherche du temps perdu
Mais bon, valait mieux pas qu’j’le rate
 
À force de lire aux chiottes…

C’est avec le froc aux orteils
Dans mes chiottes alphabétisés
Qu’aujourd’hui je fais tout pareil
Tout est hyper organisé
 
Y a entre autres ici, sur ma gauche
Mes précieux recueils de poèmes
Et les meilleures blagues de Carlos
Je vais pas le jeter, quand même
 
J’ai pour les fois où j’suis pressé
Une anthologie de haïkus
Bien sûr mes passages préférés
Ont un marque-page en PQ
 
Mon froc est toujours au même stade
Et je termine ma chanson

J’ai repoussé au maximum

Et toi, le cœur entre deux hommes
Qui s’emmêle

D’accord, ça n’a rien résolu
N’empêche que t’étais rien qu’à moi
Open bar
Dans mon rêve, on se cachait plus
J’adorais ça et à la fois 
C’était bizarre

Je suis ta folie passagère
Ton grand secret, ton autre histoire
Je suis ton petit adultère
J’attends, planqué dans le noir

D’un œil, j’entrouvre les deux yeux
Et l’atmosphère a des relents 
D’injustice
J’interroge les volets bleus
C’est du gris qui se trahit dans
L’interstice

À trop compter sur la lumière
La journée ne passera pas
Il me semble
J’étais mieux derrière mes paupières
Et le silence ici et là
Te ressemble

Tant bien que mal mais pour de bon
Je suis debout alors que tombent
Quelques gouttes
Ni lui ni moi ni oui ni non
Aujourd’hui je ne suis que l’ombre
D’un doute

Je demande à chaque heure qui sonne
Est-ce que j’aurai un peu de toi
Seulement ?
Ton absence ne trompe personne
Je surveille du bout des doigts

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last

And through foggy London town,

She's always good when she's so bad

But she's always thinking of someone
That's how it goes
She always calls me
She's lonely
Always calls me
She needs me
Always, always, always, always, always, always
Sometimes she's more than I can take
When she shines on me with a love light
Sweet heaven above
Well body presses against mine
Warm like the shining sun
She only wishes me glory
She only wants to adore me

Bent Fabric,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water

You see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun
When I dress to a T,
You see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali
and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars
That definitely ain't the wack,
I got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac
So after school I take a dip in the pool,
Which is really on the wall,
I got a color TV, so I can see
The Knicks play basketball  Hear me talk about
Checkbooks, credit cards, mo' money
Than a sucker could ever spend,
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker
Not a dime 'til I made it again  Everybody go
Ho-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
'cause I'm a get a fly girl,
Gonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ  
Everybody go ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn,
Say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
Master Gee!  My mellow!
It's on to you, so whatcha gonna do?

Well, it's on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E,
I said I go by the unforgettable name
Of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm goin' down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feelin' the highs and you're feelin' the lows,
The beat starts gettin' into your toes
You start poppin' your fingers and stompin' your feet
And movin' your body while while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn!  Ya start doin' the freak, I said
Damn!  Right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air,
Ya rockin' to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Ya rockin' to the beat without a care,
With the sureshot MCs for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face, and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do, ladies, is hypnotize
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Like a hot buttered pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie
Pop da pop pop, don't you dare stop
Come alive y'all, gimme whatcha got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride,
'Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singin' on'n'n'on'n'on on'n'on,
Rock rock, y'all, throw it on the floor
I'm gonna freak you here, I'm gona freak you there,
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere
'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put TNT in your behind  I said
One, two, three, four, come on, girls, get on the floor
A-come alive, y'all, a-gimme whatcha got
'Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said one, two, three, four, tell me, Wonder Mike
What are you waiting for?

I said a hip hop,
The hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
A Skiddleebebop, we rock, scooby doo,
And guess what, America, we love you
'Cause you rocked and a rolled with so much soul,
You could rock 'til a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast,
But we like hot butter on our breakfast toast
Rock it up, Baby Bubba!
Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang da boogie
To the beat, beat, it's unique
Come on everybody and dance to the beat!

A hip hop
The hippie to the hippie the
Hip hip a hop and you don't stop, rock it
Rock it out, Baby Bubba to the boogie da bang bang
The boogie to the boogie, the beat
I said, I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat
And I attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind, so you can't speak
And do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat,
Reast a little while so you don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, sing that song,
To the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!

Well, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies' pimp,
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front,
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker MC try to prove a point,
We're a treacherous trio, we're the serious joint!
A-From sun to sun and from time to time
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist,
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well, I was walking home late one afternoon
A reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntable
This young reporter I did adore,
So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before
She said, ""Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you
The Casanova legend must have been true""
I said, ""By the way, baby, what's your name?""
Said, ""I go by name of Lois Lane
And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can,
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman""
I said, ""He's a fairy, I do suppose
Flyin' through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy, or even cute,
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit,""
I said, ""You need a man man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night,
But can he rock a party 'til the early light?
He can't satisfy you with his little worm,
But I can bust you out with my super sperm!""
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An' I'm here an' I'm there, I'm Big Ban Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop, y'all, a tick tock, y'all, you don't stop!
Go ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
You say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend
I say skip, dive, what can I say?
I can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,
So I just tak half, and bust 'em out,
I give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house
It was twelve o'clock one Friday night
I was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right
Everybody was dancin' on the floor
Doin' all the things they never did before
And then this fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
She traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassoons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, it's time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house, this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group you hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew
Once a week, we're on the street
Just to cut in the jams and look at your feet
For you to party, you gotta have the moves,
So we'll get right down and get you a groove 
For you to dance, you got to be hot
So we'll get right down and make you rock
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rockin' affair
But let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact
And to have a party, you got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're makin' it home,
And tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn
And while you're sleepin', you start to dream,
And thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene
My name appears in your mind,
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was Phase Two just doin' a do
Rockin' you down 'cause you knew we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,
Come alive girls, get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On'n'on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man comin' on right now
He's garuanteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!

I say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet,
Like a gamblin' fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs,
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good,
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like goin' up and not comin' down,
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, you do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends house to eat
And the food just ain't no good?
The macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says, ""Mama, he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!""
So your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""Man, there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say ""That's it, I gotta leave this place
I don't care what these people think,
I'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks""
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says, ""I understand about the food,
Baby Bubba, but we're still friends""
With a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
The hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'
To the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
I say, ""Hank, can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?""
I said, ""Come on, make, make the people move!""

I go to the balls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well,
A Big Bang, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice I ever had
It came from my wise, dear old dad
He said, ""Sit down, punk, I want to talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh, a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever you do in your lifetime
You never let an MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
I'll always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse, and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you want to look
But the thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite, not a go, word
And I say a little more, later on tonight
So the sucker MCs can bite all night
A tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all
A let's rock, y'all, you don't stop
Ya go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?"" (Say what?)
Ya say, ""I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and
Drive off in a def OJ""
Everybody go, ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn""
Ya say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends
A like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all
Beat beat y'all, ya don't stop!
A Master Gee, my mellow
It's on to you so whatcha gonna do?

Well, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the Barkay's singin' ""Holy Ghost""
The sounds to throw down, they're played the most
It's like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive, girl, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the Barkays on the mic
Like gettin' down right for you tonight
Like movin' your body so you don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like comin' alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one, my life begun
At the age of two I was doin' the do
At the age of three, it was you and me
Rockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four, I was on the floor
Givin' all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee it's all the way live
At the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks
Rappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed
At the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven
Don'tcha know I went off
I gotta run on down to the beat you see
Gettin' right on down, makin' all the girls
Just take off their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight, I was really great
'Cause every night, you see, I had a date
At the age of nine, I was right on time
'Cause every night I had a party rhyme
Going on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on
Like a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn",Rapper's Delight

So in the long run
Every song done gotta be bananas
From city streets to corporate suits
From these gritty beats
All heat and nothing sweet
Get a good look, I'm here to stay
Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play

[Hook: Pink]
Every time you come to town you pick me up,
Every time you come around you lit me up,
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]
All I want to do is kick it from tonight 
All I ask is that you stay just one more night
All I want is to here you say you want me

[Benzino]
Black ice on the neck and wrist [that's Benzino]
Most hated at the top of the list [that's Benzino]
Hangman with the gangsta hits [that's Benzino]
Top dog that you never forget [that's Benzino]
Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black 
I want the platinum plaque, why'all can have the game back
Price of fame
More friends more foes new Benz new clothes no sleep no doe
Hate to see me doin it, love the chance to ruin it
 
Ferrari in the hood, you know who in it
Thug nigga, Benzino mob figga
Put some E in the liquor then its easy to hit her
Straight out the gate full plate bread winner
Always in the paint part saint part sinner
I'm young, black and rich and I'm talkin shit
The one with the six and still poppin the clip

I switched up the game but I'm still the same
How fame got the whole world callin my name [Benzino!]
Glad I came
I keep the flame
Call it how I see it
The streets to blame
Tryin do me
Live stress free
Stay away from bullshit, why'all know me
Still pull shit and let go of freaks
Toss you in a thug pit
Real thug shit
Real hip-hop, hard as concrete
I see lots of money and pounds of treats
Now check it, I rip mics and sell records
Sign autographs, respect to accept it

Hopin at least one hit your upper gums over your tooth
'Cause a lot of niggas jus talkin
want to kill a nigga on a record, when they see 'em they jus talkin
In my case, I'ma jus hawk 'em
'Cause niggas is waitin for a lawsuit, it's hot and they walkin
They sendin dudes up like clockwork

Ain't no such thing as a smart jerk
Then again, one fuckin dumb-dumb can make your heart jerk

[Benzino]:
Yo I'd like to introduce to you two very special women in my life.
Let me tell you bout this girl I know I met her in four corners in Boston some
Years ago since we first made contact I knew it was right yeah and the girl
Been in my life ever since that night her body was tight I'm tellin you dawg I
Had to get her remember like it's yesterday the day that I met her she was
Rollin with Jamaicans but on the really she told me she was raised in the
Hearts of Philly city of brotherly love was from the hood used to run the back
Woods with thugs who sold drugs her friends they used to flirt I considered
Them garbage while she was bein chased by every nigga in college used to date
Some clown from up north he used to choke her but I would never treat her like
That cause she's a smoker one of a kind honey's a dime with no seeds I ain't
Gon never let her go cause she's all I need indeed

Chorus: (She's a different kind of lady...)
She's a a dif-different kind of lady and she will never hurt you she'll never
Desert you she'll be the one to hold ya down repeat

[Benzino]:
Man there's just somethin about her (love) that I swear sometimes I can't make
It through a whole day without her some say our relationship is not that strong
They said it's just a phase won't last that long Jeff said I was wrong to fall
In love cause she was passed around I don't care she with me right now I'm so
Attracted to her vibe she got me open so wide and you can tell by the glow in
My eyes it's hard to sleep without her by my bed at night with her on my side
I'm gon be alright I love to hold her squeeze her don't let go she's my heat in
The winter when the weather is cold see anytime there's drama she gon come in a
Hurry not jealous if she see me with my main girl Mary she gon go to war with
Me hit the floor with me if I go on a caper she gon keep in the door with me I
Was smokin quick to put a nigga on blast only person that I tell where I hide
The cash she's a gangsta bitch she don't give a fuck drive-bys stick her head
Out the window push puff blow smoke out her nose it's a must a propose cause I
Love her don't give a fuck who knows she's the Bonnie to my Clyde the Tina to
My Ike her name is Nina I love her for the rest of my life

I remember when we had to keep it on the low
Flew you everywhere so nobody would know
And I remember when we got stuck in the storm one night
(remember that) pulled over hopped out had a snowball fight

Sit back in the roll hug and kiss
We used to pillow fight always makin a mess
Everything's so right never feeling stress
We used to walk the mall shop all day
We used to watch movies at the crib all day
We used to talk it out instead of throwin things
We used to pass jacob's to steam the rings
Bumpin brandy on repeat it's revealed to me
You my angel in disguise and it's real to me
Now it's clear to see it's on destiny

We gon let the track talk to em


Fly cars pretty hos rocks on my arm shit
You'd think I had the world in my palm
Surrounded by the team pockets full of C.R.E.A.M.
Still ain't all peaches and cream
Cause it's hard being a rich man specially when you black
No margin for error no room for slack
Cops stay on your back
Lyin tryin to convict me
They wait to treat a nigga you would think it was the 60's
And it

Makes you wanna holla
To the top of my lungs but the weed smoke's blockin my lungs
Watchin my son
I know this game is mean don't let him go where I've gone
See what I've seen takin puffs off the green
Keep my mind off this bullshit
It's like a mental tug of war
With every bullshit I got a keep a full clip
You niggas don't understand
I'm only human I'm just like you damn

[Chorus]:
Makes you wanna holla
Cause it's hard sometimes on the grind
When you're tryin to get them dollars man and
Prayin for tomorrow
But it might not come so I'm a hustle till my work is done
It makes you wanna holla
Cause it's hard sometimes on the grind
When you're tryin to get them dollars man
Prayin for tomorrow
But it might not come so I'm a hustle till my work is done


[Benzino]:
Livin swimmin in bucks big boy trucks
Sometimes I feel like givin it up
Drop top chrome pipes damn what a life
I'd trade it all just to sleep some nights
It's hard bein a gangsta
Specially when you get the D.A. still buildin a case
Everywhere you turn cameras all up in your face
I.R.S. audit your papes trying to take your estate
And your man's on the stand raisin his right hand
Cause you swear to tell the truth I bet you do
And it

Makes you wanna holla
Cause when you got dollars every chick wanna holla
Claimin they swallow
Need the so-called cats you knew from way back
Suddenly they your cousin wanna run with the pack
He your man long as you givin him stacks
But let you get fucked and need a buck
He ain't callin you back
Now what type of shit is that

[Chorus]



",Make You Wanna Holla
Benzino,"[Intro]
Just let the pigeons loose let the games begin Tone
Must be crazy, ay yo Sin, what's up Capone?
I created this motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Let me start from the beginnin, you ain't reppin the streets
You from the outskirts of Detroit, where the bitches meet
I'm gonna pull your skirt up, expose your true sex
Antagonize your label, till I get my respect
You ran to your manager, asked him how to handle this
Five shades darker motherfucker you'll be Canibus
No one would care about your complicated rhyme style
Another backpack rapper out of style
Don't let me have to backslap your mom's if you smile
I'm serious, if you ain't 'gon respect her why should I?
Chin check it Snoopy put a circle on that eye
My time's never up cause real niggas don't die
I'm not Moby, the little puppet on MTV
I bring glasses to your living room so you could see me
Yeah you sold a lot of units, but you can't be me
The state of hip hop, will continue to be fucked up
You playin by a different set of rules you got me fucked up
Respect the hood Marshall, or the hood'll take you out
You the real wanksta, and I don't care who you sign
Disrespect Benzino, that ass is mine
What you know about pumpin, on the block till you freeze
What you know about cuttin up rocks, duckin D's
What you know about facin, a grand jury indictment
As far as I'm concerned you just industry excitement
I hope them D12 niggas ain't who you fight with
Clash with the titan, you bound to start a crisis
Meanwhile back in Boston I'm a legend
My number in the rafters fuck Bird I'm representin

[Chorus]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)
We spit tight and we got steel (Steel)
You talk shit and you get killed (Killed)
From the streets to the studio nigga it's all sealed (Sealed)

[Verse 2]
The two thousand three Vanilla Ice how you playin it
If you ask me, you really ain't that nice you overrated
Hang you from your feet part two in theaters now
Drop your ass from the roof you gonna feel it now
You was unsigned hype, before you ever met Dre
I birthed your little career now you owe your life to Ray
The five mic giver, the Marshall maggot ripper
Better never let me see you with some jewels I'm gonna strip ya
Oh, and tell your label heads stop callin my phone (Jimmy)
Leavin messages sayin please leave him alone (Fuck that!!!)
And don't forget, how this shit all cccured to me
Your whole camp be surrounded by security
What you want? the black or the chrome?
How can you ever claim a block, when you have no home
I do it for my niggas in the cells and public housin
You takin too much X Em you need counselin
Get anybody on your roster who could fuck with Ray
Obie Trice you a busta I don't think you want to play
And 50 holla at your boy get that loot and ride
But please don't make the mistake and take this nigga's side
I hate to have to turn this battle to an all in out war
But if we have to, I'm a leave his partners on the floor
I think we both know exactly what we hear for
I want the streets back I'm comin to your door
I earn my stripes I'm a don you a pussy
Zino bombs hit you out the park you still a rookie
Bottom of the ninth, the scores lookin crazy
Niggas on my block will knock Slim Shady

[Chorus]
He's alright but he's not real (Real)

I'm a smoke until I'm fried
Help me cope with the demons that I can't hide
Intuition is a gift (nigga)
If you think that a nigga did it

Hit em in the chest and keep it movin'
Or go sit your silly ass down
don't give me no excuses that you turned your little life around (naw)
You were born into violence

You weave pain, ain't nuttin but a g thang
Anyway, you better get him 'fore he get you (get you)
Fuck around, fall asleep then he wet you
Fuck around he call the feds then they get you

And your bitch is gonna flip and forget you
Drop to my knees, Lord I'm reachin out
I'm ordain to the streets (Tell me what's it all about uh)
Kill them niggas with the clout

Eliminate these haters
I'm a deal with you later
Man this shit got me fucked up (fucked up)
Right up

My Rosaries in my hand
And I'm screamin Lord please (Lord please)
Gotta take the pain away (Gotta take the pain away)
Will I live to see another day (another day)

I was, boring in heaven, raised in hell
Fightin demons off my back
Attack and kill
Chill

When murder is an option
Gotta take precaution
I'm already known, the Lord has a plan
But it's so damn hard bein honest man

And I'm stuck in my ways
So I'm a blaze for life
Give these streets some praise
I know they raised me right (haha)

Jesus Christ, if my life turns upside-down
I'll sit beside you in your kingdom with your angels round
Hear the sound of your choir
All in my brain

The streets is on fire
They callin my name
Even though they caused me so much pain (so much pain)
They lace a thugged up on so much game (so much game)
 
The agony in ecstasy
People mad at me
If Judas' is next to me
End up in tragedy

Fuck it
I'm destined to die young
I'm losin' my religion
Speakin' in tongue

I'm on a one way trip to death
Inhaling this pain like it's my last breath (so what's next)
I'm a kill you 'fore you kill me
Fuckin' with Hobby ya dead body

It's like I hear em when they call me in my sleep
But I ain't tryin ta feel em walkin to me

I choose the one, that's easiest to me
So I choose the gun
And if you choose the wrong one choice

you better choose to run

Take it from me

Disrespect hurt but pain is when I burn a tech

Would you love me if I fell on hard times?
Lost everything, down to a dime?
Would you, let me fuck if I didn't stack cheese?
Didn't see my face on BET?

Would you, stop for me, if I wasn't on dubs?
Didn't buy the bar when I walk through the club?
Would you, let me slide if I wasn't so live?
Average joe working nine to five?

Would you still want to ride? 
Still want to freak if the ice wasn't bright in the masterpiece?
If you didn't lose sight when I flashed the three
Would you still be shakin that ass for me?

Would you, creek, let me run in it?
Kiss the first night, take it to the limit?
If I had to go to jail would you hold it down?
If not, shit I'ma leave ya now, I need to know

[Chorus: Mario Winans w/ ad libs]
I gotta know, baby
Would you be right here beside me when I'm gone

And would I still be your dream? 
If I didn't gleam on my own 

Would you still be in that zone?
Would you never leave me alone?

Outta town, if I didn't stay laced? 

Couldn't cook would you still be in my life?

Lord I'm crying out, help me get my shit together
They tryin to put me back in, but I won't let 'em
I'm a living legend in these streets - east coast gangsta
With ties to the west coast, banging
Motherfuck a street team, my team bereave streets
Since '86 street sweepers poppin out the back door
Sprayed blocks, certain niggas kept glocks
Trucks ramped, niggas couldn't understand it
Benzino, sniffin eighths of anthrax
Niggas can't touch me, my nose gettin runny
I got 5 cases, in 3 states with 6 lawyers
Had a 5S with Mass plates and 4 corners
Now I'm Black Stallion, Ferrari Twin Turbo
Probably been warned, but 'Zino gon hurt you
Enough's enough, let's take it to the streets
Raise big fire over Hangmen beats, c'mon

Go hard, or go home - I don't want to hear it
My shit too long, and now you gon feel it
We gon break 'em, crash 'em, take 'em, smash 'em 
Bang 'em, bruise 'em, hang 'em - Go hard
Break 'em, crash 'em, take 'em, smash 'em

When love and happiness were the same
Now I'm older and I don't play

Called me names and she called her dad
He got crazy and I did too
Wonder what I did to you?

Good tonight oh yeah...

All is well I can tell
Cause I like the way I feel
When I see you coming through
I won't lie, cause you take me on a high
I feel you coming through oh oh 

Say it over and over T
Hat for me there could be no other
Doubt there will be another

I won't change this line 

[Chorus x2]

I'm so proud of me
Really really going steady
With no intention of ever letting go no no

It's like years until this evening when
Gonna four that sugar on me
Gonna give me all that honey
And when the sun come shining
This is where you're going to find me 

[Chorus x2]

It's nice to rise in the morning
With the sun shining in your face
Then decided to share it
With a woman of your taste
She gave me cool cool water
And I was never thirsty after
And then she poured that sugar on me
And then she gave me all that honey
And the sun comes shining
Here is where you're going to find me 

[Chorus x2]

Say it over and over
That for me there could be no other
Doubt there will be another

Beres Hammond,"A man must be strong, to live long
Shake the negative vibe, trying to stay alive
But I never said it would be easy
Living in a system that you can't win
But by the time you know and slow
Folks hardly want to say hello
But since we've got our pride we'll survive
We believe in the black beauty 

Shake the negative vibe trying to stay alive
Wherever you go please remember
If you can't be good be careful be joyful
Oh we've come a long way and still here
Been through all the stress
And all the stress and fears
But since we've got our pride
We'll survive we believe in the black beauty 

Shake the negative vibe trying to stay alive
Wherever you go please remember
That Jah is on your side trying to stay alive
Cause by the time you go and slow
The system didn't want to see you want to see you
want to see you no more but since we got our pride
We believe in the black beauty 

Shake the negative vibe trying to stay alive
My brother move on
And stand firm in your struggle
Jumping all the hurdle shed your burden
I might say it's easier said than done
Oh but our race is a hard race to run
But if you got your pride you'll survive
If you believe in your black beauty",Black Beauty
Beres Hammond,"It isn't all physical, nor biological
But I know that I can count on you
In my darkest hour oh baby oh baby
I know you're my friend who breaks me down
And makes me feel like I'm gaining power
Oh baby oh baby 

[Chorus]
I get cold bumps when I'm near you
And then all the feelings
Bottled up inside of me
Move up to my skin
Just look at my hands
I've been trying hard to hide it
But my efforts fail to keep it
Buried within, buried within 

Tickle me here tickle me there
I need your sweet, sweet conversation
Over and over again oh babe oh babe
I bet you don't know, now you'll never know
But I get a rush, you don't know it cause I blush
But whenever you approach oh baby oh baby 

[Chorus x2]

You're such a sweet agony, pure agony
It's not all physical, nor biological
But I know I can count on you
In my darkest hour oh baby oh baby

But some kind of friend who breaks me down
And make me feel like I'm loosing power

Beres Hammond,"Can't believe I say these words to you
Could you erase them from your mind
How could I, how could I

Oh no when I know
Good love is hard to find
If you dis you'll find
You shall do the time
Good love is hard to find, yes
If you dis you'll find (now you gonna find)
You shall do the time 

It's early in the morning
Stretched across the bed to touch you
And you're not there
I picked up the phone and called your best friend
I guess it's just not my day
'Cause you can't be found anywhere
The more I keep missing you I keep forgetting
You said you'd scratch me out of the page
It's funny how something simple
Can make you change 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
When you're in love
It's such a wonderful thing
Makes you smile and sing
The joy you share no kid in candy land
Or fun world can compare
Don't tell me it's not meant to be
Just you and me for eternity
And maybe you have a different view
But I don't want you to go
'Cause you are all that I know
And I know

Beres
Did I wake you too sudden baby
Did I take you out of your slumber
Did I disturb your sweetest dreams
It's just a lovers game
I just had to do it baby trust me
I love to watch you sleeping
To see that everything was right
Oh but I felt this passion coming over
Over and over and over
And I just got to let you know 

[Chorus]
It's been a long day
We're both tired from working hard
We're almost forgetting to play
This is all I want to say
Just to remind you that
We're missing the highlight of the day 

Now that you're almost wide awake
I'm willing and ready for the take
This is where the cookie crumbles
Whether a single or a double
I'd settle for whatever
Honey let me melt in your arms
Hold me even when the clock alarms
Take the phone off the hook
Kill me with that dirty look
Let me sign in your book

Beres Hammond,"Love is the connection
That join two people together
What a sweet connection
When it's right it will last forever
But if you give it a try
And you can't get a vibes
Take my advice
If your heart's not in it let it go 

[Chorus]
Stop wasting time
Don't fool yourself it won't grow
Now if you heart's not in it let it go
Stop wasting time, don't fool yourself It won't grow 

It's not like a game
Where you loose today
And win tomorrow
Use up your brain
You don't want your world
To tumble over
Don't you rush in
Cause you'll never win
Take my advice
If your hearts not in it let it go 

[Chorus...]",Let It Go
Beres Hammond,"[Chorus]
I see love from a distance
Coming but slowly
I know it's gonna last forever
I feel us coming closer, closer and closer
It's the time we get together 

I know you done a lot of wrongs
But I'm willing to forgive
No one has the right to decide
How the other man should live
Sometimes we should stop and count to ten
Before we make each other hurt
'Cause later on you realize
It really had no worth 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
Mama she's taught us for so long
With the right, the fool we teach
And the wisdom in her eyes
Kept me safe through all the years
Made me grow to understand
That there's still good folks around
And to keep this in your hearts
Just to be on solid ground 

[Chorus...]",Love from a Distance
Beres Hammond,"Yeah baby we've been through so much
Much have been said, about you and me baby
I think it's time to prove them wrong now
All that love and all of that affection now
Can't you see that we've got it going on 

[Chorus]
But if you could give in ya baby
To all that careless whisper
You would be drowning in pain
Deep in pain deeper and deeper
You'll be hurting especially at night
And I'll be sorry we couldn't get it right
We'll be lonely living two separate lives
Don't make it too long before we realize 

A fish for you girl and a little one for me baby
That's how I think it should always be
But folks around they don't seem
To like a good living no so with their tricks
They try to come between 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
But if you should say yes
To every time they complain
Your poor heart could know
The measure of pain
You'll be hurting especially at night
And I'll be sorry we couldn't make it right
We'll be lonely living two separate lives
Don't make it too long before we realize
Don't listen to words that they got to say
They are lies they are lies
Don't get caught up now 

Oh you got me smoking
Girl you got me thinking
Wondering if you doint the same
I feel a little shaking
Oh I feel a little nervous
I also know you don't want it to end 

[Chorus...]",Much Have Been Said
Beres Hammond,"Do you know what I'd like to do right now
I'd like to lay right down girl
And put my arms around you
Wonder where will I be let's say six years from now
I wish that I could still be with you
Now if I had it in my hand control your every move
Now here is exactly what I'd do 

[Chorus]
I'd put you in the middle of my rose garden
And I would never never have to say pardon
To the daises the tulips the buttercups
Not even the roses and I'd water you first every
Morning the other flowers would have to start
Calling give me some water please
We too need to grow 

Wonder where will I be
Let's say ten years down the road
Search my heart and constantly you're there
Can't get you out of my system and I like this living
It's so wonderful that you and I can share 

[Chorus (repeat)] 
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us together
Time will change us forever
Know our love will last so I shouldn't even ask
Where will I be, will you be there with me
Can't get you out of my system and I like this living
I've searched my heart, it always sets me free
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us together
Time will change us never
Nature's gonna keep us forever

And you're weak in the knees

But you won't admit that so, you pretend
I know it's hard to look your best
Wearing that same old shabby dress
So you stay at home, waiting by the phone

Now it gives me no pleasure to say
I told you so, it's been hard to keep it low

Maybe in another place and in another time
Under different circumstances
You will find happiness so I suggest

Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game

In your tobacco jacket out in the cold
You raise your glass and indulge in ""Love like a man""
And why would I deny you the fun?
Why would I deny you the fun?

It's you and the Stones now sharing
Some alcohol
You'll have whatever Keith has
And I always thought that there were
Tears in your mug
Under a blanket, out in the cold
Sing along will you, ""this will be the last time""
But then again, why deny you the fun?
Then again, why deny you the fun?",Firework

With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Berkley Hart,"When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one",Up on Cripple Creek

Berlin

I'm alone
Sitting with my empty glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the Metro

You wore white
Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
We spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
I can see you now
Smiling as I pulled away

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the Metro

I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
