Drama,"See you niggas killin' me man
Did you think I don't hear you talkin'?
Like ""why Wayne and Dram' workin'?
Didn't Wayne dis Dram'?
Didn't Dram' dis Wayne?"" (gangsta grillz you bastards!)
See ya'll niggas just wait til I turn around then talk about me
Fool-ass niggas
But I'll do this for ya'll
Ya'll ain't learned that? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Weezy F. bitch, I'm tired of y'all hatin'
I know ya head hurtin', you Tylenol takin'
Mothafuckers I'm the man, just ask your old lady
Like a true gentleman, I'm after your lady
I'm a massacre waitin' to happen, fuck all this rappin', boy
I get to cappin', leave you with holes like a napkin
Man, he gon' need napkin, no a band-aid, not a damn grave
I am rampage Jackson on a rampage, step in my cage
Picture on my page, printed in the best book
Come up out my left pocket with a left hook
Mamma said knock ya out, money made me block ya out
I got the game on lock, and I lock ya out
My jewelery singin' like a opera house
I brought that drop top Phantom of the Oprah out
Yeah, get silly, not stupid man
Never save a ho, she better ask Soulja Boy to Superman
You can bet when I sleep, I'm poloed down, head to feet
Polo horses on my sheets, I get that from Pimp C
Tall cup of DJ Screw, sippin' on a pint of big moe
Sharper than a tack ho, you can keep the tic toe
Yea, red scarf on my neck
Red diamonds lookin' like red barf on my neck
And to my B's, nigga soo woo
'Cause I be with more B's than Ju Ju
Big Boss I'm a big dog
And I don't mean fleas when I say I'm ticked off
Ha-ha, nigga I don't ever scratch
And if she throw that pussy, big dog fetch
Type of soldier on some sketch that shit
I'mma draw that pistol make your chest a tablet
You are just a tad bit and I'm a whole lot
Young Money mothafucker, but the money so not

Sick with' it, hard body like Iron Mike
The flow is C4, I drop bombs like dynamite
You niggas is sweet, yeah sweet like Mike'n'Ikes
Bob Barker with the Phantom white, 'cause my price is right
Hit the club nigga, then I leave with' two dykes tonight
Let my niggas cut them up, they gon' get a slice tonight
Nigga peep my wrist game, you can see the ice is right
Blind everybody in this motherfuckin' spot tonight
Superman, blowing on a Swisher full of kryptonite
Got the wolves with' me here, I'm howling in this bitch tonight
Niggas say they hard body, but I can't tell
Nigga, you can get yo shit cracked like a crabshell
You want war with' the boys, so be it
We in all red like the fuckin Soviet
Army, Russia bitch nigga if he talking crazy
Hit him in his left leg, have him walking crazy",Get Bizzy

Shirley temple on ice,
She makes it just right,
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her body's so tight up under that light,
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

[Chorus: Akon]
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me wander'n now
Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer)
She got me day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her going up and down, all night)
Yes I'm day dreamin'
(Left and right, watch her going up and down, all night)
She got me day dreamin'

[Snoop Dogg]
5 foot 8 on the late what a date, she fell for the hook and the bait,
I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape
No more drama, just late night thrills
Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz
Fillin out stacks of bills, jaguar like Jacksonville,
Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill

[Chorus]

[Akon]
I'm looking at the most beautiful thing in the world (world, world, world)
Her body's so perfect and spinning like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl)
She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural)
This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal
She's like what I'm sipping on Shirley temple on ice,
She makes it just right,
That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice
Her bodies so tight up under that light,
I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes

[T.I.]
Hey I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream
Her n her girls on the stage doing they thing
Double D's full of silicon and saline
She thirty but look only a day over 18
Her booty big enough to swallow up a g-string
Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
I see her face down, ass high
Make everybody throw that cash high,
Back in the club already
She stuck in my head since last night,
That's right, girl you got my dreams so,
Sexy when I sleep,
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

[Chorus]
Ice on my wrist, I'm ballin', man
Hos on my dick, I'm ballin', man
Cases of Crystal, I'm ballin', man
Shoes of crocodile, I'm ballin', man
House on the lake, I'm ballin', man
Tight Two Def straight pushing weight, I'm ballin', man
Dubs on the Lex', I'm ballin', man
Cashing eight figure checks, I'm ballin', man

Yo, yo, yo, yo, Drama, how you doing it?
Me and my niggas - we riding dirty from Charleston to Texas
Bowling ball paint job with Ds on the Lex
Beamers and Cadillacs, Optimos and fat sacks
We trained for combat; you wrong, then we attack
We ride like Desperado on the spokes goldened out
Keep cheese in the pockets
And keep our distance from cop blockers
AK on the front seat for any drama I may meet
My pager off killing hos, providing them Bs and Vogues
Clientelle getting bigger while calculating money figures
More realer than Rockafeller, more cheese than Donald Trump
Niggas - they hear me, they want to kill me like JFK
Why?  'Cause I ride tight, on out of sight
It might be the hos, or could it be that I ride on Vogues?
My trunk is filled with speakers; I know damn well you hear me
Got a torch, you see me
Hundred spokes that beaming
Niggas plotting - they haters
And busters - they want to be me
 
[Chorus]

In the club I'm balling, bitch; now show me love
Bossalinie, Versace shoes, with some Gator boots
Dom Perion, it's on now through the early morn'
Fuck a hobby, man, 'cause balling be my occupation
Playa hating ass nigga; can't take the temptation
Want to rush me, then bust me, then leave me fucked in the game
All because I drained his bitch; now partners use his name
See the spokes, and how the gleaming make 'em want to scheme
Eighty-five Chevy Caprice off on some Dayne-Daynes
Paint job, be clocking miles with some blowed brains
Twenty and bubble, gon' buy the Reeboks - now them some shoes
With the nine up on the seat - that's where it's supposed to be
For them bustas and them haters that want to touch a G
Put it down and moved on up too, like me George Jefferson
Fuck the law, and fuck the pen, because I'm ballin', man
Loved the living, I'm dedicated all to the game
I'm ballin' man
 
[Chorus]

When I'm heated in the club, around twelve o' clock
All eyes on a playa, 'cause I'll blow up the spot
You can hate; we blowing clouts in the V.I.P.
Ballers sport rims like they stars of films
My money's too un-fadable for them too-tight crews
And tear da roof off this bitch with this Tight Two Def shit
Nigga knocking, ho jocking, 'cause this shit don't quit
In the club V.I.P till the early morning
Cases of Crystal, even Dom Perion
A McGuyver Road nigga, so you know I don't play
But if it come down to it, I got my K
Fuck the flexing, 'cause we ballin', shot callin', and stacking
And if it come down to the gunplay
Tight Two Def ain't lacking
Your money ain't long enough for me, so, ho, don't talk
'Cause down here in Atlanta, nigga, we walk the walk
I say it loud and clear
I'm ballin' man

'Cause I'm leaving niggas wrong, put a tag on that nigga toe
'Cause he'll never breathe again

Drop to my knee, asking Peter if he'll forgive my sins
The sins that I committed, I plotted before I did it
I'm looking at seventy plus, 'cause it was premeditated
The witness he never made it, 'cause I'm leaving nigga faded

Be straightened by playa haters, them bustas they wanna do
But I bar none 'cause I'm the 2000 John Wayne
Talk the talk, nigga let's walk the walk
And better worry pussy nigga, let's go to war

36 ounces man Caribbean cocaine
This dope game is all I know so how you might let it go
Feds they got me fucked want to hear a nigga snitch.
But I ain't a sucka yo and I ain't no fuckin hoe
So fuck what you talking and you can speak to my lawyer bro
Cause snitches get stitches throwed off in ditches with they dome split
What the fuck you mean what the fuck you thank I'm all about this bank
I ain't no snitch I ain't no hoe so you can let it go
Give me ten years I'll do five and be free once again
In the lab cooking that yay I'm all about my ends.

Chorus 2x

Hit Robby Rob on that hip cause he got yay for days
He fronted me five first and told me Drama fuck them jays
Give him three and I keep two and that was all good
See in this game it ain't no rules for foes and friends
It's every nigga for himself trying to get an end
See Godby Road it just ain't what it use to be
Niggas clocking bread and trying to get this meal ticket
This game we play is all so real and yes these streets be wicked
28 grams and an ounce of a thousand and 8 per key
Drop by the music store to holler at Reggie and use the phone
I never use the phone at home cause it might be tapped
And that's the first mistake to get a nigga ass wrapped
Door kicked in house tossed up but that's just how they do it
want to catch a nigga slipping and try to put it to em
Taking to jail giving no bond and lead the judge to em
It won't be me it can't be me so fuck ???
Holler at Punch up in the barber shop you heard something
He told me yeah I heard them folks they looking for you Drama

Watch the road, and don't drive so slow

But I swear I'll be all right

I sweat and talk too much
Don't shut up, don't shut down
Tell me a story, man I'll tell you twenty
Costs so much and goes so fast
Screws you up and drags you down

And I start off feeling swell 
Pretty soon I'm done too well
But I swear I'll be all right
Until the next time

Costs too much and I talk too much
Takes so long, and it goes so fast
I can't think too straight, aauugh...

Pretty soon, I'm keeping time

The things that they did - ah - they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay 

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat

I'm just a tired ape, lie awake late
No sleep when ya life's fate decided on a break
Is this a nightmare? Pinch my hand and breathe

I gotta dream and it might seem thin
But I couldn't breathe without it, it's my Siamese twin

Yeah 10 percent of your bloods from a emperor
The fam you decend from defend no surrender
And when ya
Lose it its your fault
Your bad
Cant catapult all the blame back on your dad
Mad cause the way that he raised you
Made you
The man you are today
Now one made those mistakes too
Its the break through
Finally see you making tracks
Make one wrong move bruz
See you taken back to square one
Where one will never recognize
That you switched your position until you go and check the dice
And the second time over isn't easier
No one will believe in you
And all your friends are leaving you
And growing up
Moving on
Know enough when you were wrong
People might remember to call you and ask you how your goin'
And no one gives that theres no existing love for you
Maybe you'll believe in yourself
And you'll start loving too
Knowing this is the key to the treasure chest

The last place you look that you'll never guess
I cant ever stress enough now man
I pick up blocks of gold
Turn em to sand
Everything i seem to touch
Seem to turn to stone
I sware I lead the pack
Look back, I'm alone
Cant control myself
Hold myself together
Losing faith in the game
Even tho I'm better than the competition
Its so undefined
I need to listen and the only problem is that
I lose control",Lose Control

Until the end, the end, the end, the end, the end

Think I'm a put on a record, reckon you wanna recognize
I'm a wrecking ball, wreck a site recollect the vibe
Exercise CD's, put it in your deck and drive
Jeopardize freedom, might not be a second time
Petrified as the pressure rise like the petrol price
I'm the next in line like Bin Laden's fifty second wife
Step inside the mind, mine so electrifying
Check the time, dropping biters quicker than insecticide
A Dr Jekyll hiding behind the mind of Hyde
Can't turn a blind eye like Alqueda buying dynamite
Still tryna write, still tryna find the time
When you sign the line meet more dicks than a virgina's life
A silent night, when I recite a line my lips bleed
The darkest in my family like Lionel Richie
A nineteen sixty transfixing melody
Rise the sick from the cemetery, the only remedy is

Hear the DJ spin the track
Come back around like a winner's lap
Never would you wanna get sick of that
Rewind that shit, yep bring it back
Hear the DJ spin the track
A cinematic diplomat
Kicking back, drink gin or Jacks
Rewind that shit and bring it back

Just let it play, feel vibrations through your vertebrae
Dieing to stay the highest like you were Brazil's murder rate
Exterminate all you nerd and hating sherminators
Percolated coffee, rock at night in this nocturnal age
Turn the page still unpaid, I'm paid in paper clips
The pain of being played while I'm praying to the plagiarist
The turntablist razor blade blood
Cutting quicker than Darth Vadar did to his own son
Run with hunger like goldilocks holding the rock
And me and rap we rap together like Holden and Brock, what?
It's the music, it makes your mood move with the wind
Quicker than a little you with some voodoo pins
So we

A vision with every listen the listener can picture
A situation, some over rated/over played like Neighbours
Some play then lead off the stage like Ray is (BOO)
Everyday the same play, the same the shit on TV
What yah gonna watch you're lost in Simpsons repeats
Knee deep in monkey see, monkey do
Now we up to the month of June, what up with you? Nothing new
Proven time is short, fuck it man what's mine is yours
Wise words from a dinosaur, still feels like ninety four
Vinyl forces out all the memories you swallowed in
Riders of the storm given life to Jim Morrison
Coroners report dead walking around the corodor
A common law bumping Mortar Graphic Tomahawk
If a graffers bombing or running from an under cover's Commodore
When you're home there's nothing that you want more than

Drapht,"Rest in peace to the innocent children who were shot in the back
Running from the military, Junta hot on their tracks
For the love that why their uncle packs a bomb in their bags
What the fuck, you'd do the same with no options in hand
So stop with the wack raps you illiterate stale
Horse shit, you just a piss in the gale force winds
Battling me like I have to start busting for you
I'm like a suspect package, I got nothing to prove
Fuck it, I'll serve you straight from the kitchen
And kill your fly shit like Norman Bates with a pigeon
Listen. I'm deaf and blind to your fallacy war
Like a land mine child victim all bandaged and sore
Damage and break you down until your spirit is vanquished
Like traditional ownership does to indigenous factions
It's more than just black and white, like racism
Cause the face of hate appears when you face the mirror
This more than people starving to eat
Cause food for thought is running short in this marketed scene
It's hard to believe when you feel like smashing the mirror
But Charlie Chimp will pick you up like an angry gorilla

Yeah I'm back in that pattern
I sit up late with a spliff and wait for the magic to happen
Just for rapping wack you're catchin a slappin
I'll put you under pressure like a pilot with cracks in his cabin
Have another shot, see if you can take this spot
I'm a play strategically and take everything you got
Ciecmate! Game over, now you know the deal
Here with my bro's and we're pro's in our chosen fields
Standing tall like a wall to wall, public letter blockbuster
Got a lust for life, plus a lot of love for those I trust with my life
I'm a live my life like I like on any given night and anything else isn't right
Time's ticking by, time's making changes, time's turning friends into strangers
I'm trying to find what the aim is, but time's limited
I've gotta make payments and for everyone, everyday it's the same shit
Big brother wants us all to put it in a statement
But it's built on lies like the Bush administration
The media be feeding ya and we just believe it huh?
Behind the curtain men are getting greedier
We need to peel the curtain back and hurt em bad
And then spread the wealth around to all those who've been getting held down
Can I get some help now? Or can I get a hell yeah?
I'm saying this for everybody's welfare

""Now, may these MC's rest in peace""
""Rest in peace""
[Big Daddy Kane:] ""may these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease""

Rest in peace, two thousand and six shit changes quickly
Def to all man so I'm trained in lip read
Pick me like a gypsy picking a pocket
Depict me like David Hicks holding that rocket
A mix breed of Scottish and a modern day Australia's
Home but Mundine treats us like an alien, no
Man fuck that
Singing Waltzing Matilda with my rucksack
Cut back on the ego, leave rap to the albino
Rip you quicker than teeth wrapped around a T-bone
See know evil speech insightful
Solid gold heat like Hussein's rifle
I'm spiteful, only loyal if it's like that
Starve man's best friend, he's gonna bite back
What, it's just the way that it is
Dig your grave like letting Michael J. play with your kids
I can't live in this world full of rock heads
Finding a good one like finding the Loch Ness
Monster, and not Kody Scott
But down for my team and known what I got
When it's my shot, take it never look back
Or ever make it, dedicated to my fate a known gladiator
Yeah your favourite, I run with wind
Pauly Poltergeist and the Brothers Grimm, yeah you know me

Rest in peace bottom feeders, the scourge of the earth
Proof God doesn't need us, from fetus to birth
First. my mums didn't plan me, so meet plan b
The worker bee, Ron Burgendy where the pants be
Quite a big deal, 90 something kilo
Aim for the best but got Shaq at the free throw
Overweight. Shit I can't hold a job but I can hold a steak
Wash it down with a bunch of brown bottles
Plutonic made it for snake charmers
The bass bang harder than face planting in chain armour
Heavy metal, hammers banging the hang over
In my headspace, until it's dead weight
Until the next day, return of the Jedi
Sun up to sun down, return of the red eye
Dr Jekyl, Mr Trials
Mean me on on the beat be the recipe for rest in peace",Rest in Peace

So hot but can watch the rain washing away the weight

If you're saving yourself for the marriage, not a good idea to come here
A day in the sun and one beer
Girls running around in their underwear
Wear what you wanna, whenever
Never a bouncer to tell you to wear that collar, or leather shoes

Drapht,"Check it out ah, ya, ya
From the moment we met, I was breathless
And not asbestos breathless either,
Always, when you least expect it,
Stumble across Rapunzel a Libra,
Couldn't leave, I had to meet her,
Greet the girl of my dreams with a kiss on the hand,
What up? Little magnificent missing a man,
Ran away, like kids to a van (Yeah!)
So gorgeous, walking on water,
Sort of like Erin McNaught, but little shorter,
Wore a Pandora, bought her a charm,
Wasn't short of thought ??? bit of Paul on her arm,
Calling for calm, we fought, made Iraq
And the border of Jordan a walk in the park,
Jaws of a shark, too hard to break it off,
Fall apart, so I would say:

[Chorus]
Rapunzel, gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
I'm tired of fighting,
We ain't going nowhere now

Gotta let your hair down,
Girl, gotta let your hair down,
Why we trying?
We ain't going nowhere now

And even she could see,
Her love was like a demolition derby,
I was Herbie, the love-bug, swerving,
Cause I work on the road,
She was like Russell the Crow,
A jerk with her phone!
Know that I don't wanna fight ???
Another night, chewing off my ear, like Mike,
Another night ruined, I knew it,
Knew you would do it,
Scream when I'm out, like Hewitt,
You were the one, you were the one that ran away,
Like underlay, underlay,
Then break it off, but come running back,
Like baby, I want you back, but don't call me that,
Now baby, baby,
Baby, don't call me baby-baby,
I said, baby-baby, don't call me baby,
Baby-baby

[Chorus]

Na, I'm just sick of you saying my friends are above you,
You knew, when you were with me,
But you were lost in watching Sex and the City,
And what did you give me?
Your lips moving, but nothing coming out, like Britney!
And, what, did you lose it?
No, trust: every movement watched, like Truman,
Only human, I ain't a saint, but don't cheat when I'm in the game,
And still you know, you know no, you know you don't know me,
Die from the photos I got, like Dodi,
My own Naomi Campbell, I try to help, she fly off the handle:
No more candles, no more dinner, no more, I'm fat
I could look a little thinner,
Where's my Cinderella, my little Bella?
Hard, but I had to tell her, so I'd say, yeah, so I'd say,
I keep tellin' her, I keep tellin' her:

Drapht,"See, it all started with my dad
If he rated anything I always hated it
With one catch the beauty of life
He played Grandmaster Flash and Furious Five
It was the message
And I guess that meant more than anything I was given
From him, maybe the rhythm within
Or given my similar sisters
Living for the resistance, we listen to systems pumping out
Jump around, to Rage Against The Machine
Fuck the police by NWA, we played the Grave Diggers
To Nirvana's Smelling Like Teen Spirit
And they sing it with every little bit of last breath that is in them
Yes and they listen, yes and they love it,
Yes and they live it, yes they

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn

Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

It all started as a young'n, hanging around at Hunter's flat
Once where the warriors and monsters rapped
I sat back taking it in - destined to win it
Had all of SBX as my next of kin
It was a blessing that manifested from being a guest on Done DL
That and the help from the Hydey
In '99 I had an I.D
Only 17 but saying I was 19
Hide when the cops would rock in
Nothing could stop me watching I wouldn't give in
Cause from the beginning I was living for the sound
When you walk into the room and the whole crowd singing along

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn
A place to forget about the world you're on and get the whole crowd
Singing along, they singing along
You can't change it, it's set in stone
And I ain't saying we need to get along
Just let the whole crowd sing it

Well, well look what we got here
We here to lock ears like ruggedous rottweilers
And well then why would I stop here
The day I stopped hearing the haters it got clearer
And I feared as a bearded Ned Kelly
If I would stop selling could never just stop telling em my story
Pauly walked up in here with nothing
Enough to never trust another loving Jimmy Loughnan
Cause I got these friends that will stick around
If it ever ended were there in the beginning
And then these friends in the crowd I'm surrounded by,
Together we all sing it

Singing along, they singing along
A new day, a new dawn

We can be just like a sandwich, like ham on rye
We eye to eye, we thigh to thigh, girl when I'm inside
I'm trying to work it and jerk it girl with all my might
And you know you're my favorite 'cause you keep it tight
Legs over my shoulder, hands in my hair
If you pull to tight 'cause Dre Dog don't care
Sweat from my neck is dripping on your cheast
And your sucking on my fingers as I try my best
To keep them lips up until they swell
As long as I be in you they should know me well
I'm about to get some honey so we can get sticky
Prince is in the tape deck the song is ""Darling Nicky""
I watch you as you moan and groan
Taking every inch of the new Jim Jones
Your eyes start to water, you bite your lips on your pretty face
You say ""Dre Dog Stop!"" but I don't stop the pace
I try to make it last, go ahead and grab my ass
You tell me dig deep, I try to do it fast
I'm trying to beat it up, baby in a good way
You're trying to keep up, you say you know Dre
Then she get on top and I grip you by the hips
And I can hear you say, ""I'm cumming"" these are your lips

Ooo you taste so sweet X4",Lips

There is only me alone to face the demons in my head

All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure

There's a songbird that sings,

And the forests will echo with laughter.

Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

Don't be alarmed now,

But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

The tune will come to you at last.

To be a rock and not to roll.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
And then he buys a gun and he steals a car
And he drives away but he don't get far in the ghetto

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And his momma cries

Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.

The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.

Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California

It's down at the end of lonely street, that's Heartbreak

I felt so lonely baby, I felt so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

The bellboy's always crying, the ladies dressed in black
They been so long on lonely street
They'll never ever come back
I've been so lonely baby, I've been so lonely
I've been so lonely, baby, I could die

People talkin' all around about the way you left me flat

I don't care what those people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind, and it terrifies me too
The way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you

So if your baby leaves you, got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

When I was a very small boy,
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

Dreadful Shadows,"Captured by time, I'm trying to move
But my limbs don't react. I've lost control
I'm so frail but I'm reaching the door
And I lean against, but it's closed

The fire will burn, no matter what I'm trying to do
And it seems that the flames are laughing
Figures all around, they're reaching for me
The play with me, a bloody game

And I'm tired now, I don't care anymore
'cause there is nothing I can do, nothing I could ever do
And my chains won't fall

My legs are burning and still there's no way out
No chance to escape
A last unbearable pain
And for a second I heard a voice

But I don't care anymore, I care for nothing anymore
I am insensitive now
My chains won't fall

I'll always be locked in this iron cage, where no key exist
I feel that something cuts my veins but they're dried up
I've lost all my sanity, I'm paralysed
But I don't care anymore, I care for nothing anymore

All God's children need travelling shoes
Drive your problem from here
All good people read good books
Now your conscience is clear
I hear you talk, girl
Now your conscience is clear

In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think than I can be so willed
And never do what you say
I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

We just poked a little empty pie
For the fun the people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile and pause to free

I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

Cup of tea take time to think, yeah
Time to risk a life, a life, a life
Sweet and handsome, soft and porky
You pig out 'til you've seen the light
Pig out 'til you've seen the light

Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell

Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be

Still tryna capture the moment

It's not what I want
If you can't get what you're giving
The you've got to be moving on
I've got no hard feelings 
Just a heart that needs healing
It take time but I'll find another road

Then I will know he's the one
Sure as  rain
Sure as sun
Til the day hope is gone I will keep holding on

Dream on Dreamer,"I was trapped in my own prison cell
Couldn't get out any other way
Every night I tried to find the key for
What's locked up inside of me

When questions running through your head
No answers, everything is still left unsaid, still left unsaid
How long will you ever pull through this?
How long will it take for me to relearn how to live?
Can we ever live again

I've been controlled
And I had it all
But the only thing I've been longing for
Is the heart that I can't hold

Someone please pull my head out of the sand
I'm getting worried that I keep losing track
Running circles but it's all in my mind
So tell me why is my heart not dying inside

Looking back to months and months
Spent every single day
Trying to keep up, trying to fight
Trying to get away

Am I better off without you?
When I believed everything was working for me
I was worn out, besieged by those who betrayed

I was too blind to see, too scared to leave
I was everything I never ever wanted to be
With my head held high, I walked miles for nothing
But still remembered, everything is worth something

Every day seemed like it had to be
Put down, remembered in history",Blinded
Dream on Dreamer,"When every heart that you loved has gone insane
When the smoke in your lungs doesn't feel the same
And the pain in your head just wont go away
When souls don't remember your (fucking) name

Every word that you spat out was a single mistake
Are we just cursed or dead there's no room to escape
With lights shining bright and no goals to make
Was everything I asked too much guilt to take?

You made me hate what I used to fucking love
Made up stories that seemed like they were send straight from above

They can't measure heart
When love isn't what I want

Yet I'm still here shaking
Yet I'm still here believing

How can they measure my heart?
Does it go off the love or how many times I've been a broken man? 
Or how many times you left me here


When home doesn't feel like home
Did you ever look at a picture of yourself it's not the person that I see now
And home doesn't feel like home
No more, that stranger is you 

It's time for letting go 
Of everything I loved about you to
Be washed away by those dreams (and)
Grabbed by better hearts I should have known right from the start

 Of everything I loved about you to
Be washed away by those dreams
Grabbed by better hearts I 
Should have known from the start

My hands around depression
My past to the crows

I wont pick you up this time
Drowned everything I knew would hold me down.

You picked up the stones which were meant to stay forever
You teared down walls that were built to stay strong together

I told the whole fucking world about you

We met the ones that live no more
Deceived your children you said you loved
Fooled the ones that stood up for you
Your light will shine on, until everyone receives
The hidden words of a million hearts
Behold your faith and carry on

They make no sound, when they're coming after you
And I can't hear you screaming out my name
Conquer the flags and capture your legs
Stand for what you believe in

Conquer the flags and capture your legs
The only ones that keep you from breathing
Stand for what you believe in
The only ones that keep you from breathing

Breathe in, breathe out
Behold your true faith and carry on
Read the headlines…
What they say is anything but real

Now listen to what they tell you
Nothing else will be retold
These are the terms they gave you
Walk away without a soul
Because voices remain and mark your names

If you take your hands from your eyes
You don't know where we have been and died tonight
With your eyes shut and reinforced
They won't stop until you pray for gold
As they begin to introduce their stories
Enlighten all their bodies
What they do is pull you in

But together we can fly away

And everyone because it's you
I sing this song to now.
I'll walk alone as this is what life's like now.
The cold will never be so cold, this is because of you
This is because of you.

There's no life with clean breaks.
Or no chance we can't take.
Forgiveness lies too deep
To be vanished away.

So flawless from the outside.
Never trust a stranger.
Farewell to our hearts
Remember the so called desire
A brand new spirit destiny,
Won't let my mind play tricks on me.
Closed chapters, opened curtains
To let myself be focused.

Through coldest nights we found ourselves marching.
Summer nights were meant to save us,
And stop us from aching.
I don't need another tragic ending,
No time for precious glorifying.
What's left in me will be better shortly.

I learnt too much, I've seen it all
Was love suppose to feel like this?
I can only run away
Let my past drown inside of me.
Let go and leave it all behind.

There's no life with clean breaks.
No chance we can't take.

To be vanished away.

I must confess
I thought that you cared 
But you couldn't care less

So Jennifer goodbye
Don't want to figure out why anymore
Don't want to be your fall-back guy
I'm gonna take care of me

Don't come around with all your charm
Not gonna let you in my arms
This time will be different you'll see
Cause I'm gonna take care of me
I'm gonna take care of me
I'm gonna take care of me",Jennifer Goodbye

I never thought that I could miss

I had it all and didn't know 
But I still believe we can be in love again.

To hold onto the love that I thought we'd lost forever. 
This time I'll find the words to say 
To make it better

I kept my emotions locked inside 
Only to watch love pass me by

That you don't know about
I'm someone that somehow
You seem to be without

Is it so hard to see
That I'm not invisible?

Look a little spacey
Blowing kisses your way
Will you think I'm okay?

Scream a little higher
Hold you in the moonlight
I say yeah, if you say alright

I might not be special
Not like your superman
But living and loving
Well, that I super-can

It's not so complicated
Not reinvent the wheel
Just let me know how you feel

So if I get a little crazy
Look a little spacey
Blowing kisses your way
Will you think I'm okay?

If you say alright
Then I will say okay
I will take your hand

In a world full of constant confusion

I wondered what had really

Did I push myself too far

Son departs

At all costs

Tired man
And rumors spread of mutiny
And though the time will come when
Dream and day unite
Tonight the only consolation causing
Him to fight
In fearless faith in destiny

Even when plans fall to pieces
I can still find the courage
With promise I've found in my faith

Likely or not, it's a dream that we keep
And at odds with our senses we'll climb

Reached it

With confidence and self-control 

I look at the world and see no understanding 
I'm waiting to find some sense of strength 
I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart 
To show me understanding 

I need to live life 
Like some people never will 
So find me kindness 
Find me beauty 
Find me truth 
When temptation brings me to my knees 
And I lay here drained of strength 
Show me kindness 
Show me beauty 
Show me truth 

The way your heart sounds 
Makes all the difference 
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel 
The way your heart beats 
Makes all the difference 
In learning to live 

Here before me is my soul 
I'm learning to live 
I won't give up till I've no more to give 
No more to give 

Listening to the city 
Whispering its violence 
I set out watching from above 
The 90's bring new questions 
New solutions to be found 
I fell in love to be let down 

Once again we dance in the crowd 
At times a step away 
From a common fear that's all spread out 
It won't listen to what you say 
Once you're touched you stand alone 
To face the bitter fight 
Once I reached for love 
And now I reach for life 

Another chance to lift my life 
Free the sensation in my heart 
To ride the wings of dreams 
Into changing horizons 
It brings inner peace within my mind 
As I'm lifted from where I spilt my life 
I hear an innocent voice 
I hear kindness, beauty and truth 
  

The way your heart sounds 
Makes all the difference 
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel 
The way your heart beats 
Makes all the difference 
In learning to live 

Spread before you is your soul 
So forever hold the dreams within our hearts 
Through nature's inflexible grace

It's time to pick up the pieces

Finds clearness this trial demands

Hoping that the memory 
Will leave her spirit soon

She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head 
So quietly she lays and waits for sleep 

She stares at the ceiling and tries not to think 
And pictures the chain she's been trying to link again 
But the feeling is gone 
And water can't cover her memory 
And ashes can't answer her pain

And call life from a cold metal frame

In the unity of our five-day sessions
Not even once did we hear the siren song
What kind of imagination
Asleep in some lyrical coma
Who's vain futile memory
Could have been so wrong?

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

A trifling euphoria
Was such an untimely religion
Maybe your life can explain
The reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man
The heart of this monster creation
He said we both will be heroes
And I was led into temptation

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

Can you show me your gold and your silver?
A hero in frozen water

Everything was right in my world
And then I woke up""

She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain
She'll never outgrow
Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be
Confined to this mind
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love
That's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to
Call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could
Live without pain without sorrow
As a man I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares from faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again
Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep your heart in my eyes and we'll stay alive
The third arrives

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever

She's taken you to your home

It can only take a place
When the struggle between
Our children has ended

Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby
As I lay awake in bed

To think that she would leave me now

There's a girl in the mirror

Dream Theater,"Headline: ""murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at echo's hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide.""

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he'd turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said, ""I can't love a wayward man.""

She may have found a reason to forgive
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged

Had a violent struggle taken place
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer's pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

I feel there's only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away
Than live with losing you

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time
(what we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

A red sky burns ahead 
A lonely light below me
Awake among the dead 
I can't hold on any longer
These feelings keep growing stronger
Echoes that deafen the mind
Will bury my voice in their wake
Caught in a Web
Removed from the world
Hanging on by a thread
Spinning the lies devised in my head
Living out a constant deja-vu 
Keep your head up please be patient we will get to you 
Keep your head up just have some faith and you can see it through 
Keep your head up what they want from me ain't gotta clue 
Keep your head up swallow pride before it swallows you 
Keep your head up don't dare bite the hand that's starving you 
Keep your head up  
How can you keep your head and no got insane 
When the only light at the end of the tunnel is another train

Dream Theater,"I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow
Innocence caressing me

I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more
But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever

Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might
In my den of inequity

Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the sane
Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near

'Carpe diem, seize the day'
I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall
The sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away
'Seize the Day'
I heard him say
Life will not always be this way
Look around
Hear the sounds

Cherish your life while you're still around
""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,        
Old Time is still a-flying;              
And this same flower that smiles today, 
Tomorrow will be dying.""                
We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there might not be one
The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, 'I Love You...Good-bye'

""It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear.""

""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.""
""She was killed.""

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true
Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up
I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky

A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see
I'm sick of all you hypocrites
Holding me at bay

And I don't need your sympathy
To get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy, No time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them to deal with me

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories
Run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse, alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the offbeaten track
I sit down with my son

Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one

Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done

By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive to make the grade
Then one day she woke up to find
The perfect girl had lost her mind

Once barely taking a break, now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by, it's meaningless to try
And all she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

'Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly, she will fall out of the sky

I remember when we were so young
You embraced my fears and made me strong
Never did you actually hold my hand
Your silence no one else would understand

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside

Do you like the clothes she wears today
Colliding love affair against a shade
Often times I wish she'd speak to me
Her holy open book, a world revealed to see

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me all you're feeling inside

So easy, easier
If you spoke to me
So easy, easier

Invisible blood line that only you could see.

Oblivious to the damage he has done,

Don't you dare cross the crooked step.
Watch the way you talk,

Passing all the blame
Living out a life of decadence
Acing without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do

You can no longer hide (Break out of this isolation)
Let humility (Openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (A healing tranquility)

Burning in the night

I break down walls to find you

Callow and vain
Fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
Passionless stage
Distant like brothers
Wearing apathetic displays
Sharing flesh like envy in cages
Condescending
Not intending to end

Some will transcend spinning years
One as if time disappears

Innocence faded
The mirror falls behind you
Trinity jaded
I break down walls to find you

Beginnings get complicated
The farther we progress
Opinions are calculated
Immune to openness

Beyond the circle's edge
We're driven by her blessings
Forever hesitating
Caught beneath the wheel

Dream Theater,"I never wanted to become someone like him so secure 
Content to live each day just like the last 
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me 
And I wanted so much more 
Far beyond what I could see 
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him 

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed 
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision 
So secure 
Content to live each day like it's my last 
It's wonderful to know 
That I could be 
Something more than what I dreamed 
Far beyond what I could see 
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time 

As far as I could tell 
There's nothing more I need 
But still I ask myself 
Could this be everything
Then all I swore 
That I would never be was now
So suddenly 
The only thing
I wanted 
To become 
To be someone just like him

II: MEDICATE (Awakening) (8:45-12:15) 

A doctor sitting next to me 
He asks me how I feel 
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while 
But thinks he has cured me 
From a state of catatonic sleep 

For 30 years
Where have I been? 
Eyes open 
But not getting through to me 

Medicate me 
Infiltrate me 
Side effects appear 
As my conscience slips away 

Medicate me 
Science failing 
Conscience fading fast 
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage he prescribes 
But there's no guarantee 
I feel it starting to take over me 
I tell them not to be ashamed 
There's no one who's to blame 
A second shot
A brief awakening 

I feel the relapse
Can't break free 
Eyes open 
But not getting through to me 

Medicate me 
Infiltrate me 
Side effects appear 
As my conscience slips away 

Medicate me

Remove all obstacles from our path 

Asking questions
Search for clues 
The answer's been right in front of you 

Try to break through
Long to connect 
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath 

Loyalty, trust, faith and desire 
Carries love through each darkest fire 

Tortured Insanity
A smothering hell 
Try to escape but to no avail 

The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore 
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more 

Innocent victims of merciless crimes 
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs 

Step after step

Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man 
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Getting right down to the heart of it

Dirty enough for me to lust 
Leaving nothing left to trust 
Jealous enough to still feel envious 
Lazy enough to sleep all day

Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of my control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

I try to shut it down
It leaves me in the dust
No matter what I've found
I can never get enough

Frantic actions of insanity
Impulsive laced profanity
Long for elusive serenity

Aggravate, agitate

Nowhere to turn

Tattered memories of what used to be
Apocalyptic mind debris

Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings
Forged in the void of night

Out of the blackness; chaos
Belongs to the prophet's sister
A sickening monstrous sight

Through that stifling heat underneath the pale green moon

Climbing endless stairs, leading to the choking room
(Eager to explore his most shocking mysteries)

Drifting beyond all time
Out of the churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Rage in a vortex, fighting
Rays of destruction swallowing
The echo of the universe
I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate god of my creation
Sent to unleash this curse

Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear

Grotesque creatures battle)
Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer
(Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind)

Trapped in a hellish dream
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way

You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

Let's go for drive
I love the way I feel uptight
Just step inside

Maybe you'll recall
I kind of felt curious
A character inspired by my brother's life

Winding through the hills
Seeing far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

And last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald hills
An ancient world of times gone by

Now let me introduce
My brother
A bitter gentleman - historian
Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight - no accident

I
Want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right

I
I don't wanna die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I
Want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candle light

Then viewing through the past
I saw which is believed
Still dressed in royal clothes
A saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Stuck inside these castle walls

Soldiers came to hide
With barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of old that's where they died

Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the angel's share
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

I
Want to stay alive
Everything about this place just doesn't feel right

I
I don't wanna die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I
Want to say goodbye
This could be the last time you see me alive

I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

It took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

Now wait a minute then
That's not how it is
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems
Please try to forgive

The chapel and the Sade
The soldiers in the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother
Tell them about me

Dream Theater,"I've got a nightmare to remember, I'll never be the same
What began as laughter so soon would turn to pain
The sky was clear and frigid, the air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget and I bet I never will
Picture for a moment the perfect irony
A flawless new beginning eclipsed by tragedy
The uninvited stranger started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride and made our way back home

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
Father and mother
holding each other

Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night
Crushing glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights
Screams of terror
Pain of fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes
Sudden stillness
wrapped in silence
No more screaming
No more cries

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Lying on the table in this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger, a man without a face
He said, ""Son do you remember? Do you even know your name?""
Then he shined a light into my eyes and said
""Take this for the pain""

Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
and thought of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony

""Tell me, does this hurt you?"" said the faceless man
""Can you move all of your fingers? Can you try your best to stand?""
I asked about the others
""Is everyone okay?""
He told me not to worry as he turned and looked away

Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling, lost in this wonderful misery
In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
and thought of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony

Day after day and night after night
Replaying the events
Did they ever see the red light?
Over and over, scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams
How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived, it's a blessing no one died
By the grace of God above, everyone survived

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
It will stay with us forever

Eager to give it all away

Is what you leave behind

ah yeah, Dream Warriors
as we enter the brink of reality
battlfield
trust me seven times seven times
but you prefer not to
here I go into a lifelong trip
are you ready for this?
come solider


Verse 1:

ringin' on into his disorder
I serve the square
so step there's nothing left you can't compare
to the noble unbeatable length of hair that I bare
so bare witness I'm physically fittin' this
a desease so MC's please take a techna shot
you got what I give I never get got
glue to the gift so what's up dread
you couldn't bob to the bass but now you're hooked like a bass head
I'm about to show ya contract and attract ya
blow off track come back and smack ya
loaded lyrics stronger than a game of tug-o-war
Dream Warriors are built right cause I got a megabyte of storage
so don't tempt me I'm empty
don't get too close I might absorb your energy
if you're not a friend of me I grow you like cannibus
make you give me a hand you can't handle this
crazy rampagous makin' team ages
walk through the getto with getto blasters playin' us
general entrance be part of the solution
you take it to your brain but your brain is confused
and confusion is the style that I send
don't think it makes your mind bend
just journey on


Chorus:

draw your mics men
and wipe the sweat from your dome
as we enter this battle with a fearsome rage
universal peace must be this outcome
dust and strife stricken
we have moral to the full
board your steeds my minions as we path on
tray me I slay the no mutiny


Verse 2:

take a picture of this 
you trying to dis
so much smoke you get choked from the microphone mist
aw shucks you're outta lucks
yo try to tax but get waxed
the song strong enough to carry you
and my rhymes strong enough to bury you
but I don't I make you jam until the jam is done
until the cash is cahsed unto me the nickelodeon
like that snap ??? back the style has hung you
buy a noose produce who
now this is the part 
mystics prevail
the critics wrong song goes up in a sail
the legacy begins check the store
you want more then tie up your boots and just journey on
pankgooes and scallowags vanish
MCs who talk about me vanish
when I'm on stage I'm kicking harder than a tidal wave
I'm making bootys like you memory save
cause when I entre pronto en delay
I hear on the dispatch
(mayday mayday)
an S.O.S. for a new bag of sess
and kick and shook you into nothing less
proceed on


Verse 3:

on your 12th daydream you try your best to control it
but the magic avoids you the stage is a street
and the wink of an eye you could fry in agony of defeat
now toothles ruthless and raw
looking for a way to get even but you withdraw
cause with no label you're disabled and handicapped
but you pledge allegiance to the life of battle rap
no choice now you must face your own fate
no straight path so is life nothing is straight
maybe one day you'll wake up and realize
you the live by the sword you die by the sword
surprise Dream Warrirors possesses intelligance
but you cry wolf but that's irrelivant
no what you must be now is simply
sit back and rock in your own inequity
city's the limit from when you finish your song
now you journey too but what you really must do is journey on

Outro:
we must change
we must change
we must change",Journey On
Dream Warriors,"here we go are you ready for one other
Dream Warriors' noise is new discover-al
once again with a new blend so telephone a friend
(yo dude I just got this new song It's dope man)
compact disc to the prime is optimist
fans and friends I'm universally cosmic
concrete jungles abound
you stand by the speakers 
you're smothered and covered up in the sound
you stand strong as you pump your fist
I'm talkin' all that jazz
now what's my definition

Chorus:
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition
my definition
my definition is this
my definition 
my definition is this

when I kick rhymes there's something said to do damage
hits so strong even superman needs a hand
so bob your head dread as I kick the funk flow
this rhyme is subliminal yet you don't think so
I walk with a gold cane a gold brain and no gold chain
behind the truth lies there lies a parafix
in the mix is where Dream Warriors go
define if you will but I know so
there is no definition

Chorus

rhyme thou I know it to flow it just like a poet
your definition of me is definitely wrong
why must I try to lie and build an alibi
when all you ask is just for me to be me
replace a replacable replacement with this
relax relax relaxtion boombastic
my name is King Lu
(mine is Capital Q)
bags of mostly water search to find my definition

Chorus

I sought beauty through the dust of strife
I sought meaning to my music addicition
arise awaken we have need to reverse
a plauge has befallen us no time to reherse
this rhyme speaks it speak and has spoken
this rhyme will not change things
it needs to be changed in a hurse
you find caskets in my rhyme baskets of rhyme
your definition can define
so what's my definition

In my sink
You wash your face in my sink
In my sink (sink)
You wash your face in my sink
In my sink (sink)
You wash your face in my sink

Simplicity with synchronicity make a mind meld
Revealed if possible like a walk in a mind field
Sadly, you get up to bat and take a swing thing
Should I
Shouldn't I try?
Too late
You sunk into the sink that I wash my face

You wash your face in my sink
In my sink

Tougher
That's what I'm getting
I'm getting rougher
And you beat me?
Suffer
The attempt of an attempt well tried
Well your side tried
But my side will never be denied
'Cause I'm swinging it stinging neglection
With an injection of truth
I've come to untwist the twisted youth
How does it feel now that I've got you all to think?
Yeah, and wash your face in my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Here I go I here I go I here I go again
I have a little place to send a little false friend
Who tried to mess me up with little negative thoughts
A little negative taught
Me to never ever leave my fame into the hands of incompetence
That makes sense
So now I change the tune for the tune allows changes
For you to take a breath while your brain rearranges
What I just spoke into a language called speech
You try to catch it but you just can't reach
For you leave a ring around the basin
When you wash your face in
In my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Now the basin is clean to the gleam of the eye
You constantly lie ""when dove's cry""
Out that you are not about what you say
The image of the field you reveal and portray
For never ever will I fall fall to the effects of bandwagonism
So please listen
Up not down
For down is the devil
So roll like a boulder and not like a pebble
You roll like a rock, you roll like a rebel
For this is pure pain
Pick ax and a shovel
Hear no command
Hear just warning
If you wake up in the morning
And wash your face in my sink

You wash your face in my sink

Swing on the grounds of the play ground
The wire to the amp to improve the sound
I mean give me an M-I-see that is clean
And witness the warriors of the dream
For the bigger the orange
Is the bigger the peel
Thieves who steal
Get a wheel for real
A spin to infin or until I give a pardon
Me, I never promised you a rose garden
Or nourishment just punishment for a fink
Who thinks he can wash his face in our sink

You wash your face in my sink

Open up the door
Step across the wet floor
You can make it
You can tape it
This rhyme forevermore
Peer into the drain as the water goes down
Why do you frown is the end of the sound

But bring back the rhyme
For the rhyme is evaporated
And all of the sucker MCs
To the Jones is saying
They would
They could
They think
But never ever never dare try
To wash their face in my sink",Wash Your Face in My Sink

Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
Baby used to be a California dream
But eventually everything becomes a dirt pit

In a showroom frame I attract another hit
If you run to the sun, call Lu, then you trip
I think it's time for you to retire, you skipped
That's what you get when you suck too much less
You get penis end, like the girl in the tight dress
A mess hall, we all in your balling
There's no where to run when the roll is calling
May it be me, cause I flow from within girls
Tell me I'm a hoe, drop the stereo and we can flow
Loop like cause this might be magic
Watch it might engulf you and catch your snatch
There it is, what it is
A house is in the middle of the street
To swallow my gift is a feat
But I hate to see without eyes
When people try to sabotage
But I'm quite successful at espionage
Try harder man, come on harder
Cause if you don't, then come on, why bother
You're in my air evaporate at a rate greater than wait
I'm changing fate
Hey, look
I made ya look
Who's in the kitchen cookin' chicken, mama
Excuse me baby I don't mean to interrupt
But my mind's corrupt now that you got my interest up
You're best I edit the wish bones before I credit
Cause I must show my versatility facility
Peep me like tom
Must you, I bust you
I smash you into dirt and leave your crew laughin' at ya
I'm coolin' like Laverte
You're hurt if I'm leavin' you

[Chorus]

Plot thickens
When reflects is flex like the sex faces
Into private places
It's me baby
(Is it you Lu?  Really really you?)
Touch me and tell me if it's true
Did ya miss?
(Yeah, I miss.  Did you?)
Yeah I miss
Then commence to kiss kiss give me sugar
Cause you be the bona fide baby booger
You know, we go together like a gun and a trigger
(Yeah right, then who's this?  I can't believe this.  
I thought I was the world to you.  Shit, what is this?)
Come on baby, you're trippin' to illusion conclusions
You think I would want that old broken down car
Now who picks me up when I'm down
Come on, who puts a smile on my frown
Come on who makes mmmm
(You crazy)
So then let's blow this joint with God speed
Cause you know, I've got the remedy for what you need
Twelve inches of steel, spinning wheel
Cause you can't fight the feel when I'm in
Better turn the volume up to ten, and dim the lights
Cause tonight, you're takin' flight

Ah, but the next day somethin' went wrong
Huh, she slipped
Found a note, must've fell from her coat
Said I'll meet you at the Eaton Centre at a quarter to eight
And don't be late
Okay, so I thought about the shit that my mind was going through
Took two pills and then called the crew
My crew said ""Chill King, we'll fix it, don't sweat it.""
""Bother you? Don't let it.""
I got it

[Chorus]

But that's what you get
Like a need a mostly dream
Like a dream, you sit inside a pit and you fiend
Now pain, pick ax and shovel, I digged and
I gotta get out, I gotta get out, gotta get out
Of this pit, I'm bigger than her
But my chest is crushed turned to mush
For real
If I ever shot myself it was just to get the feel
So suicide was out of the question
Did I mention
I didn't get a tricycle, thanks to Mr. Trojan
I'd be walking around like these other brothers, trippin'
Aimlessly, like a record skippin'
But once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy (dry your eye)
Once bitten twice shy and I won't lie
MC's that think I didn't evolve got something comin'
I sleep with words and verbs is my pussy
Fattened like a cat, got your tongue you dirty rat
There's some wisdom in retreat, think of that
Your impact is hollow and you follow and submerge
Now people pull your card, you're livin' on the verge

open up your eyes wide so you can see 

it's thick to be me 

how I kick my rhymes down pat 

within the circle how we do 

when we kick that fact 

but where's the meaning? 

I take it one night by one night 

but where's the meaning? 

I take it one day by every day 

I pick a rhyme I chose and put it number one inside my placement 

so look to find the signs inside my basement 

no tears 

sell us full of samples with ample time to loop 

it's just the beats from the dead from my head with my troop 

and it be cool if all the time was like studio time

the low budget picture in my room and in between I write scriptures 

picture this the day's just a claender's notch 

and every kid becomes the one who want to ride it on the crotches 

and when I'm finished when my flick is almost done 

when my rhyme is half done 

when I check a late re-run 

I lose to the groove soul sounds soothe me well 

sometimes my mind wonders sometimes heaven could be hell 

I pass the fools who has never known my name 

when I think about the deal sometimes I need someone to blame 

I add members to the show who knows a fan 

for the ones that want to capture the essence of level 

to the hip-hop their directions they groke 

who's representing us? the critics holy smoke

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

On a mountain in Switzerland,
Yo lo lo lo,
There lived a fair young maiden,
Lovely but lonely,
Oh oh oh oh.

Day after day,
She'd pine her heart away,
Yo lo lo lady ya,
But no love came her way.

Some day we'll go,
Down to the village in the valley,
Then you'll meet a nice young man,
Ask for your hand,
Then you'll be happy

Never came true,

Wouldn't she be better if she did find love?

そっと髪を撫でて 肩を抱いて
そばにいるね
あなたが眠るまで
やさしいキスをして

電話してくれたら 走って行くから
すぐに行くから
なにもかも放り出して
息を切らし 指を冷やし
すぐ会いに行くから
報われなくても 結ばれなくても
あなたは
ただ一人の 運命の人
今日という一日が終わる時に
そばにいられたら
明日なんていらない

Dreams So Real,"And so it comes to an end
And everything that you thought turns out to be
Feathers borne on the wind
Bearing witness that gravity will win
And take you for a spin

The cleansing showers fall
They're falling, falling

Send me down, down to the sea
Float me on this raging river
Leave me just my memory

Now I start to see
Just as it's ending
The river is bending
And drowning me

The snow that falls in December
Could be the rain in the Gulf of Mexico
And though I know I'm a sinner
I'm still an angel when I get back to home
Where I can do no wrong

Nothing can please you, to cease you to yearn
You reach out for sun, you bore under ground
What lies there for you?
Searching for riches and treasures of old

Burrowing under, reaching for stars

No! What have you done

Ruler the king with heart so cold

Disaster struck over opulence
Gone was all that glory

It washed away their pride

In a cold lonely tomb
In the depths of sea
Aeons of wealth came to end
Into sea they descent

[Music: KerÙ?nen]

Beautiful bride
And undaunted knight
Are lying in bed, holding hands
Side by side

They started their life
As husband and wife
And now it's time to show

How much they care for each other,
How far they're willing to go?

He moved on real nice
And made her come twice
But then he wanted
To put on some spice

Please hear me prey
I want you to stay
As still as you can be

[Chorus:]
I gave you a taste and you want for more
Let me come to your garden through your back door
Is there anything sweeter in whole wide world
Than ride with this magical wild horse

Oh, I'll taste you in my mouth
My hunger for you makes me howl like a hound
Shout, shout, shout, shout for more
I insist for another round

While you break all the seals
Find what darkness reveals
Come the daylight and change your creed

You know pale lights don't shine
Echoes don't glow like the sun

Where white knights find their tomb
So wait 'till the morning shall come

Back in the days (3X)
Back in the days (2X)

Back in the days of eighty-three
Breakdancin at the crib with my man Dupri
When the Saturday nights was LIVE in the West
When honies were fly, the flavor was good but
on the burnt side, was where it took place
On the cheap sound system without no bass
Coolin with my man DayDay, the DJ Machete
I want a record deal, but I knew I wasn't ready
But back then I still had more fun
I even rode around my guy the rookie named Michael Jordan
Long before Tag Team and 95 South
Real Planet Rock shit used to funk the house
But the schoolyard Crips and PPD's were too rowdy
Some of them started rollin to the ?dotua? parties
My dance group called the Frat Boys was winnin
The parties was live cause General Lee was spinnin
When the summer came I was off to the Ridge
With my pen and my pad, I met new kids
Marty Mar, a.k.a. the Big Mo
Big Ben, Af Rock, yo we stole the show
Makin tapes all the time, it's like I couldn't quit
But when I listen to em now I'll admit
That it wasn't alla that in fact we was wack
But every now and then, huh, I want to go back

Back in the days
I want to go back in the days (4X)
I want to go back (2X)

Spring eighty-seven, down with the four man crew
cool Kat, Disco, and my man Steve Blue
No record deal, but I was still rhymin
Big Mo hooked me with a kid named Diamond D
Not the one from the East he went to school in Arizona
said he liked the way I rocked the microphone-a
We knew our, producer, but he was a flake
That lived in the projects, said we had to wait
Sittin in the car for hours at a time, buckin bullets down
But that's how bad I wanted to rhyme
Back when the hip-hop shit always had the airplay
The best station in nation which was KDAY
I got serious about my flow
Hooked up with a brother that they call Domino
And Diamond quit and left the twelve, over at my crib
I hooked it up to my cassette player, tell you what I did
I would pause mix breaks, whatever it would take
I only had three records couldn't dig in any crates
And there was times when I wanted to stop flowin but my
best friend and lover Ajay, yo, she said to keep goin
When all we had to eat was cup of noodles in the six pack
Cause I went and spent all my ducats on the six track
On the real, no food in the fridge
But when I won the rap contest at Northridge
Everybody flipped, yo we didn't know how to act
Daaam, I want to go back

I want to go back
I want to go back in the days (6X)

Bill Duke, a well known deep brother
Hooked me with the soundtrack on Deep Cover
That's how I met Belial, from the Bronx
He had more beats that house niggaz got conks
Showed me all kind of beat makin tricks
Just like Machete showed me how to pause mix
and I was married to the shit like a husband to a wife
But when I tried to rhyme up at the Good Life
Yo I got dissed I couldn't buy no respect
But in two years I came back to catch wreck
On the set and jet, cause that's how it had to be
And my man Tragedy became amazed at me
So he put me inside, the Cadillac
The chaffeur drove off, and now I can't go back
Hahaha, back in the days

I want to go back in the days (6X)
I want to go back (4X)",Back in the Day

The pen ink is running dry,
It's been thrown to paper and wasted,

Creativity has been blocked and over tasted,
Maybe in time, I'll appreciate it

Hold on, hold on, we'll be with you soon

These papers are stuck in this book,
'till they're torn out and pasted,
To inside of my memory, 
Where I can later look and see them in a new gallery, 
Where they can later be 
Viewed and appreciated.

Hold on, hold on, we'll be with you soon,
We'll be with you soon

Longing for what has been lost,
And longing for what hasn't been obtained,
It's a small cost, forgot the past, lost the future,
Only now remains

And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand

Treat a nigga like a treat, call him when I need a fix

Feelin' like I'm Kobe, I ain't giving niggas passes
Yeah I get it but I go hustle like I ain't had shit
If I got paid to piss you bitches off I'd be mad rich
Flexing on the 'Gram but broke in person, that's a Catfish
Got her own money and a crib, now that's a bad bitch

Gave mercy to these hoes, what would Jesus do?
Somebody got to take a loss, shit it was me or you
Mean mugging in the Ghost, they yellin' Beetlejuice
My niggas with me got more stripes than an Adidas suit
I took a break from all the hype to let you bitches get practice
They want me to give my seat up like I'm Angela Bassett
Probably catch me in the closet like I'm coming out
Hope bitches just as good on foot the way they run they mouth
Your man outside and what he drive was the only challenge
First date, hundred a plate, that's how I know he got it
Get you touched the first defense so niggas know we 'bout it
Trippin', have you swimmin' out on Stoney Island, this ain't no emoji battle

Put in that work 'til we proud, we got this shit off the ground
And I'm still fine with no makeup so I'm slayin' hoes when I leave man
Second time getting top from the same nigga, call this shit a recap
Got the roof down with the seat back and a middle finger to the feedback

They tried they hardest to get rid of me
I'm still breathing for a reason
Prolly 'cause it's my season
And all my downfalls got overshadowed by my achievements
I knew that I was different but nobody ever saw the vision
So 'bout a year ago all of you believers was missing
Trying to offer me a slot like I paid for attention
All the clubs I couldn't get in
All the lists in wasn't mentioned
I'mma show the critics who they underestimating
Take over city by city then might start reinstating
I'm black and educated, but I'm over dedicated
You can imitate it, but no bitch you cannot replicate it
That's why we separated. That's why you love the hated
That's why a practice I acted sophisti-gang-dang-it
I surround myself with niggas that think the same way

I've been living out my dreams I almost thought that I was sleep
I came from nothing, and nothing you want from me got' be cheap
I might start charging to compete
I sent armies on the retreat
It took patience, I swear they broke me down until they feel like I couldn't take it
Now I bet all these bitches stay in line like they tracing
Get Benjamins for a payment
I never could be a racist
My words is killing you ladies, lets take 'em back to the basics
Your fake relationships' for a paid placement
They wait to on tracks with me like I'm a train station
Used to be like you 'cause I was in that same basement
Now when people talking the haters sinew me in the same statement
I go overtime, fuck a nine-to-five, takin' niggas of like a weekend

Was once my obsession
Ended up as a regret
Only right I confess
Inside I'm a mess
I just want somebody I can give my best
Dont turn your back like the rest

I'm not perfect
I have flaws
But I'm so worth it
Had my heart broke once now I build walls
Not on purpose
I dont have it all
But I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it

Insecure or is it intuition
Never knew someone like you existed
You might be the pieces that I'm missing
Hesitant but still I can't resist it
No I ain't the richest but I pay attention
You could be my partner like we on a mission
Diamond worth a jigga
Down to pull the trigga
Bet I love you more than all them other bitches
Use to run the liqour
Judging in the mirror
Wish my hair was longer, wish that I was thicker
Gotta have a frame, so you love the figure
When I finish hope you see the bigger picture

I'ma be the realest with ya
I can be myself when I'm with ya

Drenge,"We lit, a fire on the moors
To watch the purple heather and the gulls
Go up in smoke, in late July
A stupid thing to make you smile
That bracken burned like nothing I've ever seen before
What have I become, I left my friends
I'm so different now
Have you forgotten my name?

Down empty streets, where footsteps never ring
The village halls, the priests now full of it
The hours spent in silent towns, discarded cars we drove around
The city still, it never sees the rain

I took the shower just to wash off the shame

And London's husk of burnt out rust
That led the lungs a bag of dust

Draw a line in the sand
Coast to coast and man to man
Repopulate the Sherwood Forest
And lynch the deathly pale dishonest

Carve a scar across the earth
Visible from high above
North and South, sever ties

Over waters deep below
And running home, through the night

He's making me believe he'd done alright
He's making me believe his was a lifetime

Did anybody hear what I just said?
Oh my

Guess that's why
He's bye bye

I played the hook.

My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago

[Chorus]
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.

Drew's Famous,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name,
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night
Oh, I, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon
 
Oh what a night hypnotizin' mesmerizing me, 
She was ev'rything I dreamed she'd be 
Sweet surrender, what a night
I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder,
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under

Why'd it take so long to see the light,
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.

Good-bye 
The sky it was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there 
Some place back there 
Smiling in the pictures you would take 
Doing crystal myth 
Will lift you up until you break 
It won't stop 
I won't come down, I keep stock 
With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop 
And then I bumped up 
I took the hit I was given 
Then I bumped again 
And then I bumped again

The velvet it rips 
In the city we tripped 
On the urge to feel alive

The days you were wearing 
That velvet dress 
You're the priestess, I must confess 
Those little red panties 
They pass the test 
Slide up around the belly 
Face down on the mattress 
One 
Now you hold me 
And we're broken 
Still its all that I want to do 
Feel myself with a head made of the ground 
I'm scared but I'm not coming down 
And I won't run for my life 
She's got her jaws just locked now in smile

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
When it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
Out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight.

And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
Never have drifted down a bayou stream.
But I heard that music on the radio,
And I swore someday I was gonna go:
Down a highway 10 past Lafayett;
There's a Baton Rouge.
And I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets

If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.
 
And if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of
Lead you to a lonely place 
Find your strength in love",Greatest Love of All

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

We'll pack a lunch, and stuff you in the trunk, Earl

Drew's Famous,"When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My mama used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes

And then all of a sudden
Ah it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing
To a family
Lookin' back all I can say
About all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad
That he didn't have to be

I met the girl who's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

And then all of a sudden
Ah it seemed so strange to me

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

Most said that I was a failure

Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by

We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking

Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash

It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash
They did the monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash

Seems he was troubled by just one thing

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,
The nation's only White House
To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

Wandering the night,

Was so exciting
Something in my heart

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
On the half shell they're the heroes four.
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with mugging mysterious.
All police and detectives are furious 
'cause they can't find the source of this lethally evil force.
This is serious so give me a quarter.
I was a witness. Get me a reporter.
Call April ONeil in on this case eh.
You better hurry up.  There's no time to waste.
We need help like quick, on the double.
Have pity on the city man it's in trouble.
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger when 
Tonto came pronto when there was danger.
They didn't say, ""We'd be there in half an hour.""

Now our ace reporter was hot on the trail,
determined to put these crooks in jail.
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened but before she knew it,
she fell in the trap and got caught.
Yeah, she was all alone, with no friends and no phone.
Now this was beyond her worst dreams 
'cause she was cornered by some wayward teens.
Headed by Shredder, they were anything but good.
Misguided, unloved, they called 'em ""the foot.""
They could terrorize and be angry youth 
and they'd mug the people who needed proof.
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound.
Shouting ""Cow-a-bun-ga"" as they hit the ground.
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower 
'cause they possessed Turtle Power.

When you stand for what you believe in, 
and find the strength to do what's right, that's Turtle Power!
Heroes on the half shell, they're on a mission.
When there's a battle got the enemy wishing that they stayed at home instead of 
fightin' these Ninja Masters with moves like lightnin'.
They were once normal but now they're mutants.
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students.
Leonardo,Michelangelo and Donatello make up the team 
with one other fellow, Raphael.
He's the leader of the group, transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop.
Pizza's the food that's sure to please.
These Ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese.
Back to the story, it's not hard to find.
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind.
Those were the words that the Master instructed 
but a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted.
 
That was the last straw. Spring into action.
Step on ""the foot"" now they're gonna lose traction.
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice.
Your shell is hard so you shout, 
""They can't dust us off like some old coffee table.""
Since you been born you been willin' and able to defeat the sneak, 
protect the walk, fight for rights and your freedom to speak.
Now the villian is chillin' so you make a a stand.
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand.
Remember the words of your teacher, your master;
""Evil moves fast but good moves faster 
than light shining for your illumination.""
Good versus evil equals confrontation.
So when you're in trouble don't give in and turn sour. 
Try to rely on your Turtle Power.

Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress

It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine

He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home

That makes you treat me so?

I must refuse your hug and
Little wish for one night love
Don't mean to hold you up
I got a coach ticket and one way dream
Just thought you'd like to know
I'm in love with little Joe

Chorus

Hey I'm gonna let it all hang out
I wish for little things
And to make you cum I had to bleed
Hey I'm gonna let it all hang out
Sure'd like to wish you well
But I pray to God you go to hell

Verse II

No time sure'd like to stay
Gotta make it, make it the American way
Not what I thought you'd be
Then again I fucked the king
And all the chicks you know
They just line right up to blow, blow, blow
There's just one thing that you should know

Uhh ohh I wait to hear you say...

Oooh yeahh

Take me away

Maybe I come on to strong
Then again I'm always wrong
I'm so tired of taking the long way

Assume that I am still distraught
As long as we're re-living

I'm making new memories without the horror
I'm begging you, let this story end

Has it that he was an honorary pall bearer at
Ronnie's funeral such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And Bear Bryant wore a cool
Lookin' red checkered hat and won football
Games and there's few things more loved in
Alabama than football and the men who know how to
Win at it So when the Bear would come to town,
There'd be a parade. And me, I was one a' them
Pussy boys cause I hated football, so I got a
Guitar but a guitar was a poor substitute for a
Football with the girls in my high school So my
Band hit the road and we didn't play no
Skynyrd either I came of age rebellin'
Against the music in my high school parkin'
Lot It wasn't till years later after
Leavin' the South for a while that I came to
Appreciate and understand the whole Skynyrd thing
And its misunderstood glory I left the South
And learned how different people's perceptions
Of the Southern Thing was from what I'd seen in
My life Which leads us to George Wallace Now
Wallace was for all practical purposes the
Governor of Alabama from 1962 until 1986 Once,
When a law prevented him from succeeding himself
He ran his wife Lerline in his place and she won
By a landslide He's most famous as the
Belligerent racist voice of the segregationist

South Standing in the doorways of schools and
Waging a political war against a Federal
Government that he decried as hypocritical And
Wallace had started out as a lawyer and a judge
With a very progressive and humanitarian track
Record for a man of his time. But he lost his
First bid for governor in 1958 by hedging on the
Race issue, against a man who spoke out against
Integration Wallace ran again in '62 as a
Staunch segregationist and won big, and for the
Next decade spoke out loudly He accused Kennedy
And King of being communists. He was constantly on
National news, representing the ""good"" people
Of Alabama And you know race was only an issue
On TV in the house that I grew up in Wallace
Was viewed as a man from another time and place
And when I first ventured out of the South, I was
Shocked at how strongly Wallace was associated
With Alabama and its people Ya know racism is a
Worldwide problem and it's been since the
Beginning of recorded history and it ain't
Just white and black But thanks to George
Wallace, it's always a little more convenient to
Play it with a Southern accent. And bands like
Lynyrd Skynyrd attempted to show another side of
The South One that certainly exists, but few
Saw beyond the rebel flag And this applies not
Only to their critics and detractors, but also
From their fans and followers. So for a while,
When Neil Young would come to town, he'd get
Death-threats down in Alabama Ironically, in
1971, after a particularly racially charged
Campaign, Wallace began backpedaling, and he
Opened up Alabama politics to minorities at a rate
Faster than most Northern states or the Federal
Government. And Wallace spent the rest of his life
Trying to explain away his racist past, and in
1982 won his last term in office with over 90% of
The black vote Such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And George Wallace died back in
'98 and he's in Hell now, not because he's a
Racist His track record as a judge and his
Late-life quest for redemption make a good
Argument for his being, at worst, no worse than
Most white men of his generation, North or
South But because of his blind ambition and his
Hunger for votes, he turned a blind eye to the
Suffering of Black America. And he became a pawn
In the fight against the Civil Rights cause 
Fortunately for him, the Devil is also a
Southerner",The Three Great Alabama Icons
Drive-By Truckers,"Throw another log on the fire, boys, George Wallace is coming to stay
When he met St. Peter at the pearly gates, I'd like to think that a black man stood in the way.
I know ""All should be forgiven"", but he did what he done so well
So throw another log on the fire boys,
George Wallace is a coming?

Now, he said he was the best friend a black man from Alabama ever had,
And I have to admit, compared to Fob James, George Wallace don't seem that bad
And if it's true that he wasn't a racist and he just did all them things for the votes
I guess Hell's just the place for ""kiss ass politicians"" who pander to assholes.

So throw another log on the fire, boys, George Wallace is coming to stay
I know, in the end, he got the black people's votes, but I bet they'd still vote him this way.
And Hell's just a little bit hotter 'cause He played his hand so well
He had what it took to take it so far

Drive-By Truckers,"Now Sheriff Buford Pusser's gotten too big for his britches
With his book reviews and movie deals
Down at the car lot making public appearances 
For breaking up our homes and stills
I know he likes to brag how he wrestled a bear
But I knew him from the funeral home
Ask him for a warrant, he'll say ""I keep it in my shoe""
That son of a bitch has got to go
That son of a bitch has got to go

Now they lined up around the block to see that movie
And crying for his ambushed wife
Marveling about about shot eight times and stabbed seven
Some folks can't take a hint
They say he didn't take no crap from the State Line Gang
What the hell they talking bout?
I'm just a hard workingman with a family to feed
And he made my daughter cry
Said he made my daughter cry

""Watch out for Buford!"" is what they keep on telling me
But to me he's just another crooked lawman up in Tennessee
He gets a new hot car to keep us on our toes
And that ridiculous stick where the press corp. goes
And some big time Hollywood actors playing him on the big screen

""Watch out for Buford! He's shutting down our stills and whores""
But it ain't like he's all that different from what was there before
It wouldn't take my man long to do the job
Just a partially sawed through steering rod
And I wouldn't have to worry about the good Sheriff anymore
Now the funeral's got'em lined up for twenty blocks
No one liked that SOB when he's alive
But the ruckus he began keeps a spreadin' like a wildfire
Not sure if I'm gonna survive

Hit an embankment doing a hundred twenty on a straight-away
The Lord works in mysterious ways
They'll probably make another movie, glorifying what he done

Dammit Elvis, don't you know
You made your Mama so proud
Before you ever made that record, before there ever was a Sun
Before you ever lost that Cadillac that Carl Perkins won

Mr. Phillips found old Johnny Cash and he was high
High before he ever took those pills and he's still too proud to die
Mr. Phillips never said anything behind nobody's back
Like ""Dammit Elvis, don't he know, he ain't no Johnny Cash""

If Mr. Phillips was the only man that Jerry Lee still would call sir
Then I guess Mr. Phillips did all of Y'all about as good as you deserve
He did just what he said he was gonna do and the money came in sacks
New contracts and Carl Perkins' Cadillac

I got friends in Nashville, or at least they're folks I know
Nashville is where you go to see if what they said is so
Carl drove his brand new Cadillac to Nashville and he went downtown
This time they promised him a Grammy
He turned his Cadillac around

Mr. Phillips never blew enough hot air to need a little gold plated paperweight
He promised him a Cadillac and put the wind in Carl's face
He did just what he said he was gonna do and the money came in sacks

Dammit Elvis, I swear son I think it's time you came around

Drive-By Truckers,"I came to tell my story to all these young and eager minds
To look in their unspoiled faces and their curious bright eyes
Stories of corruption, crime and killing, yes it's true
Greed and fixed elections, guns and drugs and whores and booze

It's been a while since I put on a suit of my own clothes
And even longer since I cast my shadow on a church house door
They say every sin is deadly but I believe they may be wrong
I'm guilty of all seven and I don't feel too bad at all

I used to have a wad of hundred dollar bills in the back pocket of my suit
I had a .45 underneath my coat and another one in my boot
I drove a big ole Cadillac, bought a new one anytime I pleased
And I put more lawmen in the ground than Alabama put cottonseed

I spent a few years on vacation, sanctioned by the state I mentioned
But a man like me don't do no time too hard to come back from
The meanest of the mean, I see you lock away and toss the key
But they're all just loud mouth punks to me, I've scraped meaner off my shoe

Somewhere, I ain't saying, there's a hole that holds a judge
The last one that I dug myself
And I must admit I was sad to lay him in it, but I did the best I could
Once his Honor grows a conscience, well folks, that there just ain't no good

There's a pretty girl out there said ""Daddy, you stay cool tonight
All I need from you is to come home and be here by my side
Say what you gotta say to shut their Bibles and their mouths
If they was to tie a noose, they'd have to lay their Bibles down""

I ain't here to save no souls and even if I could
I could never save enough to put back half the ones I took
So if they rest in torment you can't say it's cause of me
They'd long been bought and paid for like that fool's in Tennessee",Cottonseed
Drive-By Truckers,"Before I could walk, I had a wrench in my hand
I was my Mama's little angel and my Daddy's second chance
He went end over end the first year he went pro
Lost part of his eyesight and he couldn't race no more

But he never lost his touch when he got underneath the hood
He knew how to make them run and he knew one day he would
See his name in victory lane and engraved on that cup
Just like all them other crazy fools with racing in their blood

He would put me on his lap when he'd drive and I'd take the wheel
He'd say ""What do you think about that son? How does she feel?
You just wait till them little legs get long enough to reach the gas
Once you put her on the floor one time there ain't no turning back""

Every Saturday, he'd take me out to the garage
He'd take an empty bucket and fill it full of engine parts
He's sit me down and pour em out in front of me on the floor
I'd have to tell him what each one was and what each one was for

We'd jump into the car and go down to the race that night
He'd tell me what each driver was doing wrong and what each one did right
He could always pick the winner before they ever took a curve
Number three might have the car but 43 has got the nerve

Before I turned 18 Daddy said ""Now pretty soon
You'll be old enough to drive but I'll leave it up to you
I taught you all about it, taught you everything I know
You gotta have a car to do it and you gotta work and buy your own""

The first one I bought was a Mustang number two
Nobody kept'em any longer than they kept a pair of shoes
They started showing up at every used car lot in town
A V-8 on a go-cart, easy terms, no money down

Me and Daddy and my uncle took her home and tore her down
Checked her out real good, cleaned her up and bored her out
Took out all the seats, pulled the carpet off the floor
Knocked out all the glass and welded up the doors

The first time that I raced my qualifying was a shame
I started out way in the back and came back about the same
I pulled her in the pit, couldn't look my Daddy in the eye
He said ""If you quit now son, it's gonna haunt you all your life""

It ain't about the money or even being number one
You gotta know when it's all over you did the best you could've done
Knowing that it's in you and you never let it out
Is worse than blowing any engine or any wreck you'll ever have

Since then I've wrecked a bunch of cars and I've broke a bunch of bones
It's anybody's race out there and I've learned to race my own
I'd shove em in the wall and I'd hit em from behind
I'd let them know that I was there, I'd let them know that track was mine

It's been several years now since my Daddy passed away
But his picture's on my dash every time I go to race
I lost more than I won but I ain't gonna give up
Till they put me in the ground or Daddy's name's on that cup",Daddy's Cup

Drive-By Truckers,"I watched the rain; it settled in. We disappeared for days again.
Most of us were staying in, lazy like the sky.
The letters flew across the wire filtered through a million liars.
The whole world smelled like burning tires the day John Henry died.

We knew about that big machine that ran on human hope and steam.
Bets on John were far between and mostly on the side.
We heard he put up quite a fight. His hands and feet turned snowy white.
That hammer rang out through the night the day John Henry died.

When John Henry was a little bitty baby nobody ever taught him how to read
But he knew the perfect way to hold a hammer was the way the railroad baron held the deed.

It didn't matter if he won, if he lived, or if he'd run. 
They changed the way his job was done. Labor costs were high.
That new machine was cheap as hell and only John would work as well,
So they left him laying where he fell the day John Henry died.

John Henry was a steel-driving bastard but John Henry was a bastard just the same.
An engine never thinks about his daddy and an engine never needs to write its name.

So pack your bags, we're headed west and L.A. ain't no place to rest.

Her Daddy stood out by the cemetery fence
Prayed to God for forgiveness
For surely all of this is punishment for my sins

They put her in the family garden
Said you could hear his heart breaking miles away
All the men pitched in and bought a marble angel
To mark the piece of land where little Bonnie lay

My Grandma said she would keep her in the mornings
So her Mama could sleep a bit and do the chores and such
She'd read her stories about little girls and magic powers
That would never let a pretty angel hurt

Her Mama's always been a beauty
She's still beautiful to this very day
But they say Bonnie's crystal eyes put the stars to shame
Maybe heaven needed Bonnie's face

My Grandma said she would keep her in the mornings
A swollen angel who never would complain
She'd read her stories about little girls and princesses
Whose Daddy's don't feel punished for what heaven takes away

I'd be about as half as tough as I pretend I am
Then I wouldn't care how empty this old house feels
I could take her things and take them far away from here

Cause looking at that stone wouldn't bring me so much pain
I could go into town wearing my finest clothes
I could turn these tears into blood and make it run ice cold

One hour away from as close to the moon as anybody down here is ever gonna be

Would have been go out
And find yourself a whore

Gonna be a world of hurt

That blowing my brains out wasn't the answer
So I decided, maybe I should find a way
To make this world work out for me

I thought about that a lot back then
I think about that again and again

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt

""To love is to feel pain"" there ain't no way around it
The very nature of love is to grieve when it's over
The secret to a happy ending is knowing when to roll the credits
Better roll 'em now before something else goes wrong

No, it's a wonderful world
If you can put aside the sadness
And hang on to every ounce of beauty upon you
Better take the time to know it
If you feel anything at all

Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt
Gonna be a world of hurt

So if what you have is working for you
Or you think that it can stand a reasonable chance
And whatever's broken seems fixable
And nothing's beyond repair

If you still think about each other
And smile before you remember
How screwed up it's gotten
Or maybe dream of a time less rotten

Remember, it ain't too late to take a deep breath
And throw yourself into it with everything you got
It's great to be alive

To that last shot of vodka, and all them miles in between.

A man like me won't last too long in prison
And all those friends down at Police Department
Will act like they never had anything to do with me

Started out down at the junk yard, taking orders from a moron
And a man my size don't like taking orders, from anyone
Bought myself an old beat up wrecker, I built an empire with my labor brains and sweat
But it's hard to make an honest living and a man takes any help he gets

Nothing much for a man in my position, a second mortgage and three
College kids tuition and all them friends that I helped along the way

We had us some good times and I've always been a family man deep down.

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?

Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,""Do you want to make a deal?""

To be without a home, with no direction home?

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal

Was she crazy or just plain old mean to have gone and done it?
She said she heard the bang and was afraid he'd be mad, and made a run for it

Said, they were having a fight and the gun was a bluff
She didn't pull the trigger, it just went off
Said that he berated her about everything
Make her do things that made her feel so ashamed

Made her dress up slutty before they had sex

What they put up on display the locals couldn't quite grasp

Popcorn, heavy hairspray, nylon pantyhose
Please stand and bow your heads and pray you don’t get old

The nurture and the admonition of your kind
The rules of only strong survive
Cross shaped swimming pools,
Down in the blood and lifted up
Forever seeking favor from the light

Schoolhouse hallway like a prairie highway sprawls
The drop off spins away the sun
The getting there just proves it’s nothing but a ball
Pray the horizon never comes

The hearts of the daughters of the men,
Won by the softness of the sons of women’s hands
To leave it up to love would leave it left to chance

Memory only shows the promise beauty broke
Of beauty ageless in it’s time
Light attracts the same, you glance away and the glory fades
And being on your arm has lost it’s shine

Drive-By Truckers,"We went to Grand Canyon
And we stood at the expanse
And we watched the rocks change colors
And we watched the shadows dance
And we probably didn’t say anything
As the sunset turned to night
We let the spirits do the talking
With cascades of faded light

And we drove across the desert
Saw the mountain range at dawn
Heard the thunder rumbles echo
Against the rocks that Gods were made from
And we drove across the wastelands
Until we finally reached the sea
And I wonder how a life so sturdy
Just one day cease to be

I’m never one to wonder
That the things beyond control
I stare off in the darkness
I'ma feel the highway roll
I feel the highway roll

And we roll on in the darkness
To some city far away
Lug our sorrows, pains and angers
And we turn them into play
There’s no time to dwell upon it
It’s this life that we chose
That made it all worth living
Through the horrors that life throws

If the recently departed make the sunsets
To say farewell to the ones they leave behind
There were technicolor hues to see our sadness through
As the sun over Athens said goodbye
Said goodbye

Said goodbye

There’s a white owl out my window
Soft-lit in fading light
He’ll go soaring through the clouds
And go hunting through the night
And in my dreams I’ll still can see him
Flying through a western sky
And I’ll think about Grand Canyon
And I’ll lift my glass and smile

And lean on her to help you on your way
You use her credit cards, complain cause it’s so hard
To live with all the whiteness you’ve obtained

So you pack up all your things and cut those apron strings
And set out for a drastic change of scene
You hump it town to town and never let them down
Or take the time to ponder what it means

You climb up to the roof to smoke a few
And calm down from your day and soak the view
And you wonder what the hell you’re gonna do
To hang on, to hang on

It isn’t any wonder when the darkness pulls you under
From the weight of all your wonderment
And the price you have to pay
Leaves you feeling kinda sickly and it all comes due so quickly
It’s hard to get out from under it

The night it grows so long but you put it in a song
That suddenly the whole world wants to sing
So you move to higher ground and set some deep roots down
And try to keep your grip on everything

So you close your eyes and try with all your might

Warm between the cushions where she hid whatever treasure fell out

Driver Side Impact,"I can feel the trees cowering from the rain
Like they never had seen it before
I can feel the fire burn for me with its rage
To never be extinguished by crossing paths with running water

My body's never felt this cold
It's like I'm losing touch yet gaining more control

I'm losing hope
With every step my bones are coming close
To falling off from skin that holds it close
I need the glue that pulls me back to you

If I was the flame, I'd burn the trees
To save them from the rain that's coming when this is over

If you played your part as well as I could play along. You would still be called a liar and I would still come back for more. â??I hope you die from dreamingâ??

Your all alone, never thought you would be the one to go. Did you think you weren't replaceable? Funny how you were the last to know. That you're all alone
