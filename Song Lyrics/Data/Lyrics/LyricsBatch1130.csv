Roy Nathanson,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me

And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me
You took advantage of me",You Took Advantage of Me
Roy Nathanson,"I remember that dance 
On the roof of my car 
When St. Lucy's mad torch 
Took away our best bar 

Say we drank 
And we prayed 
Some just sat like a choir 
Came the smoke 
In the night 
Came the heat 
Came the fire 

Ember glow lagered ash 
I was pissed as a fart 
Stricken some dumb plum numb 
We was broken at heart 

Say we drank 
And we prayed 
Some just sat like a choir 
Came the smoke 
In the night 
Came the light 
Came the fire",Fire Suite 1
Roy Nathanson,"That all could gather 
That we could marry 
Still 
Faces absent 
That she could see this 
As if time hovered 
That he'd caress him 
That jars and lads and Carol Ann were 

Shouts from brilliant corners 
Word 'n tears confused 
Sparks long sky bound 
Long sky bound 

Had I been wiser 
And not so bleedin' 
Still geezer poet 
Wine cross the lips flow 
Love through eyes goes 
That he'd embrace him 
That jars and lads and Carol Ann were 

That all could gather 
That we could marry 
Still 
Faces absent 
That she could see this 
As if time hovered 
That he'd caress him 
That jars and lads and Carol Ann were 
Set by the bar so tender",Fire Suite 3
Roy Orbison,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh, oh, after the love has gone

Roy Orbison,"Working all day
And the sun don't shine
Trying to get by
And I'm just killin' time
I feel the rain
Fall the whole night through
Far away from you

California blue
Dreaming all alone
Nothing else to do

Everyday I pray
I'll be on my way
Saving love for you

One sunny day
I'll get back again
Somehow, someway
But I don't know when

That I left far behind

Doing all I can do
To get back  to you

Roy Orbison,"They say the heart must feel it all. 
Know every rise and everyfall. 
To earn the right to stand in sunlight. 
Someday the sun will always shine. 
Deep down inside this heart of mine. 
And it will be my time. 

Rivers keep flowing. 
Cold winds keep blowing inside me. 
I walk alone. 
Hard rain keep fallin' 
Lost souls keep callin' so lonely. 
I hope I find. 
Love in time 
Love in time. 

You know a man can't always choose. 
Love has its rhythm and its blues. 
I hope it's there for me.

Cold winds keep blowing inside me. 
I walk alone. 
Hard rains keep callin' so lonely. 
I hope I find .

Roy Orbison,"If I my friend can't tell you. 
When you my friend are wrong. 
Not to do what you want to 
Just because it's wrong. 

Well then my friend in passing. 
We've been friends too long. 
And I my friend must tell you, 
Leave that woman alone. 

Your little girls might not understand, 
And you know the baby would cry. 
And what would you do if their mommy knew, 
And she told you ""goodbye""? 

Let it end my friend say it's over, 
And thank the stars above. 
That you've got a home to run to, 
And a sweet sweet woman to love. 
I must say my friend if you stay my friend. 
Leave that woman alone.leave my woman alone.",My Friend
Roy Orbison,"You always said that I'd be back again
That I'd come running to you in the end
I thought that you were on your own
And now I find you're not alone

I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more

You always said that I would know someday
Just how it feels when your love walks away
I let you down I let you go
I lost you, how was I to know

I'll see you through the rain
Through the heartache and pain
It hurts like never before
You're not alone any more

I never knew I could feel this way
I never could see past yesterday
You feel that everything is gone
I feel it too, you're not alone

I'll see you through the rain
Every heartache and pain
It hurts like never before

You're not alone
You're not alone, any more, any more,any more",Not Alone Anymore
Roy Orbison,"A light shown in the night some way ahead, blue turned into green then it was red
And stirring the night love music played the light I saw in the night was a penny arcade

Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored lights cascade
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime

At first I thought it a dream that I was in, lost, lost in a sea of glass and tin
But no, so dipping my hand in the back of my jeans I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machine

Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored lights cascade
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime

Oh! step up and play each machine seemed to say,as I walked round and round the penny arcade
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle and you'll make all those colored lights cascade
And music played at the penny arcade, yes it played and it played, played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime

Roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last, roll up and spend your last dime!",Penny Arcade
Roy Orbison,"You know I peeked in to say goodnight,
When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair. 

Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air. 
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair.",Scarlet Ribbons
Roy Orbison,"When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide

From that old lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

I remember how you always get that certain look in your eye
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
'Cause that old lovin' you feeling again (lovin' you feelin)
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Lovin' you feelin', lovin' you feelin' with you

We were so close
We were too far apart
I gave you my love
I wanted your heart

Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again (lovin' you)
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That lovin' you feelin' again

No matter how much I've tried
This lovin' you feelin' inside
It's taken such a long, long, time
To say goodbye

And getting over you
Is so hard to do
With this feelin'
Lovin' you

That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again
That lovin' you feelin' again
Lovin' you feelin' again

Roy Orbison,"Listen all you people 
Try and understand 
You may be a soldier 
Woman, child or man 

But there won't be many coming home 
No, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
Maybe ten out of twenty 
But there won't be many coming home 

Now the old folks will remember 
On that dark and dismal day 
How their hearts were choked with pride 
As their children marched away 
Now the glory is all gone 
They are left alone 

And there won't be many coming home 
No, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
Maybe five out of twenty 
But there won't be many coming home

Coming at you through the haze 
He may be the younger brother who ran away 
And before you kill another 
Listen to what I say 

Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many coming home 
Oh, there won't be many 
There may not be any 
But there won't be many coming home

Roy Orbison,"I was a clown when I thought I had found
A love for me and only me but she laughed at the clown
Turned him down, turned him down

I never frown, ah, ah, ah, I'm the clown
For it breaks my heart, I play the part of a clown
Running round, trouble bound, I'm the clown

I wander all around wondering if you ever cared
I go from place to place, I look from face to face
Hoping that you will be there

All over town, the word is out, it's all around
That I love her still, guess, I always will I'm the clown
Running round, trouble bound, I'm the clown
",The Clown
Roy Orbison,"Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day 
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away

Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart 
It cries and cries all night long 
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me 
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong 

Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery 
You know I'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame

Her tender heart just fell apart as she said, ""Good-bye""
Now today is her birthday, my baby’s sweet 16
But someone else is in my place to hold my every dream

Pum bum bum da de da
Oh oh oh yeah, yeah
Pum bum bum da de da ah
Come back to me my love
Come back to me

Roy Orbison,"Too many quarrels so now we break up. 
No there's no chance to ever make-up, 
But when they ask me. 

I'll say it's my fault. 
I'll take all the blame. 
I'll say I was wild, 
When I should have been tame. 

I'll say it's my fault. 
I'll give a good show. 
I'll say I'm a needle 
That just wouldn't sew. 

Every one will be wondering, 
All our friends will inquire. 
Which one did the blundering, 
Who put out the fire? 

So, I'll say it's my fault. 
I'll say there's no doubt, 
Then cry as I wonder, 
Why it didn't work out.",I'll Say It's My Fault

And now what's left for me to do 
But watch those raindrops and cry over you 

You've stolen my love and my heart away

And I'll feel the same for the rest of my days

Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all passed away!

List while I woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng

Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chanting the wild Lorelei;
Over the stream let vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.

E'en as the morn on the stream let and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,

Brings back the memory of your embrace 
I start to cry into my lonely wine 

Teardrops fall but all they bring is heartache 
It's better if I never think at all 
Still they soothe the pain my lonely thoughts make 
I never quite succeed in hiding all, so let them fall

And when the clouds roll by I'll come to you 
But until then I'll drink my lonely wine",Lonely Wine

Built the wall of confusion between right and wrong
That stands between her
And the dream I had cherished so long

Now faded and tattered
Once all that mattered when she was here

Roy Orbison,"I'm a poor peasant boy, I'm a dirt farmer's son
And I feel like a king when I know that my work is all done
For at twilight I know, there's a place I must go
To sing my song of love for one who waits all alone

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor

Oh, the beautiful sights of the great city lights
Where most people must run to try to have fun, not for me
For this woman of mine is much sweeter than wine
And I spend all the time I can find with my Marie

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor

Oh, the joy of my life will one day be my wife
And we'll spend all our days watching the world roll on by
When her time comes to fly to that home in the sky
I pray the angels above will love her as much as I

Yote amo Maria, Maria amor
Yote amo Maria, Maria mi amor",Yo Te Amo Maria
Roy Orbison,"Bye bye love bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy I sure am blue

She was my baby tlll he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

Im free from romance Im through with love
Im through with counting the stars above
And heres the reason that Im so free
My loving baby is through with me

Roy Orbison,"If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real? 
But it's only false emotions that you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry",Cry
Roy Orbison,"Dream
When you're feeling blue
Dream
That's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rising high in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream
When the day is through
Dream
And they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream",Dream
Roy Orbison,"I'm gonna move into 
A house without windows 
So I won't see you walking by, walking by 
With your new love 

There in the darkness of 
My house without windows 
I will never see the stars that shine 
Shine on you, and your new love 

I'd rather wonder through this endless night 
Than to face the light of another lonely day 
Knowing that you won't be there 
There to share, these two arms ever again 

I'll take all my broken dreams 
And I'll take my broken heart 
And from now on you will find me there 
Crying there, trying to forget 
In my house without windows 
In my house without windows 
And without love",A House Without Windows
Roy Orbison,"There once was an Indian brave by the name of Yellow Hand 
He fell in love with a maiden know as White Sands 
They vowed their love would last forever more 
Then came the day that they had waited for. 

Yellow Hand brought her a golden feather 
White Sands said a prayer for good weather 
The ceremonial dance grew loud and strong 
Then Yellow Hand began their wedding song. 

Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
Tonight, tonight, We will be one 
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun 
Oh White Sands, come hold my lonely hand. 

Then they left the warmth of the raging fire 
And rode into the hills climbing higher 
And suddenly the snow came swirling down 
They were lost the trail could not be found. 

Oooooh Oooooh Oooh Ooooh 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
Tonight, tonight We will be one 
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun 
Oh White Sands, Come hold my lonely hand. 

They never returned from Paradise 
They went to their places in the sky 
And the old ones still say when the snowflakes fly 
If you'll listen close you'll hear him cry:

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
Tonight, tonight We will be one 
We'll walk in the land of the midnight sun

Roy Orbison,"When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know

My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer",My Prayer

Take a look at what you've done
You've broken my heart in two

Roy Orbison,"There's a place I call Sleepy Hollow 
Where I go when you're not around 
There's a brook running clear in the meadow 
I lose my blues in it's sound 

The wind and the trees from the hollow 
Whisper secrets of life in my ear 
When I lay down in their shadows 
I dream that you're still here 

The bubbling babbling brook is your laughter 
The wind blowing softly,your touch 
I've found the one thing I'm after 
Your love, your love means so much

For this heart of mine to break

Might as well throw it away.

The postman just came by
All he ever brings
Are bills and nothing things

Oh no, he returned your letter
And it's time to cry
Yes, it's time to cry

Time to cry
Ever since you said goodbye
Time to cry
What else can I do but cry over you?

I just can't stand it

The sun is out of sight
Another lonely night begins

And you're not mine
Guess, it's time to cry

Always to remind me that it's only another day, 
To feel this way.it's lonely.Lonely. 

I am lonely all the time, you're not mine. 
Without you I find,it's lonely. 
Each new starry sky, smiles and says goodbye,it's lonely. 
Dreams we used to share tell me you don't care, it's lonely. 

The moon has lost its glow, it's lonely. 
It is there to show me that it's only another night, 
I can't hold you tight, it's lonely.Lonely. 

I know why I cry, for all the world to see. 
You're not here with me, it's lonely,Lonely,Lonely.",It's Lonely

I walked out to the rainbow's end and found a rainbow love 
The one that I was looking for, the dream that I was dreaming of 
There, down at the rainbow's end I found a rainbow love 

I found my pot of gold, my rainbow love 
Just you and all your loving, charming rainbow love 
I searched, hoped someday I'd find someone to bring me peace of mind 
I found what I've been dreaming of when I found my rainbow love

Roy Orbison,"Harley Spanish nights
Are still on my mind
In a small cafe
We danced all night away
Don't lost in love in time
When I left that day I heard you cry and say
If you find someone new
You'll break your heart in two
You know what to do
Come back I still be too
With Spanish nights and you
I can't forget the day it's almost been away
Begging me to see a world not mend for me
Now my search is true I'm coming home
To Spanish nights and you
Magic Spanish moons
Sleepy afternoons
Fill my memory
Walking handing hands
By the sea and sand
I know you'll wait for me
Feeling all alone now I'm almost homeless
It's time I know I'll stay
The Lord has heard me pray
I have heard Him say
Lover on your day
Bring your Spanish nights away
I can see the summer light
Enlights and holding you
On this Spanish nights",Spanish Nights

They say that you're looking for a home
Fresh out of a love affair, fresh out

I know I ain't much but you can have me for free

Oh sweet, sweet Belinda
You don't owe me no gratitude or love
We're just two souls stuck here
Two lonely rivers filled with life.
Two lights shinin' in the darkness ahead
Two feet touchin' in a cold winters' bed

Tears that I'll carry with me all through the years

Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now
For things I didn't do

And melt your cold, cold heart?

That you belonged to me

He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk 
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere 
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid 
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed 
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be 
And wishes he was still an old pine tree 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red?

Gotta get a lot of oysters, find some pearls today,
To make a pretty necklace for Leah,

I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right --
I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight.
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me,

But something's wrong, I cannot move around --
My leg is caught, it's pulling me down,
But I'll keep my hand shut tight, for if they find me,
They'll find the pearl for Leah.

Old heartaches and memories from the past.
It was just another dream about my lost love,

The way that you used everything that god gave you 
I gave you my heart like a child, one moment you took me to heaven 
Took me back to earth and then before I woke up to the fact I was small you took me back to heaven again 

And I remember the Indian summer how you held me, how you loved me (Loved me loved me) 
The world may give me a million reasons but reasons don't make it wrong 
Every lesson I learned has a price in return I was lost in my youth and to tell you the truth 
I was empty and you filled me with a glow of love a loving loves may die 
Just to hear you that sees me through, oh what I'd give to re-live all the Indian Summers with you 

So many hearts have been broken (Dum dumb dumb dumb-by Do Wah) 
You had no trouble with mine like a fool I was there for the taking (but then) 
It was only a matter of time you can lie in the sun with the warm wind blowing 
Just knowing you've already paid but you can't live alone in an Indian Summer at 110 in the shade 

And I remember (and I remember) The Indian Summer 
How you held me in the moonlight 

We were riding along on a silver dream never dreaming it off our head 
and if I'd known I'd lose you the moment I found you I'd love you all over again 

'cause I'm still empty (I'm still empty) Come fill me ( Come fill me) 
With a fire of love your flame will follow flame 'cause it's all I want to do

And if you live just for today the day may soon be done 
But there's a place where dreams always stay so young 

A place to hear the sun go down and fade away 
To see the wind just run away with yesterday 
Anyplace for those who care Zabriskie Point is anywhere 
Time runs out so fast on love too good to last,so young 

A time to look forever's there or never found 
To touch the sky and really feel the world go round 
To live to love to laugh to cry to be alone 
Young,so young love was meant to be wild and free 
So young young,so young love is space in life

When tomorrow's gone and love is lost so young",So Young [From Zabriskie Point]

I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes I'm the great pretender

I seem to be what I'm not, you see

But in the real world
We must say our goodbyes
No matter if the love will live

Help me find the party that tried to get in touch with me.

They would not leave a number, but I know the place to call,

Cause my uncle took a message, and he wrote it on the wall.



Long Distance Information, get in touch with my Marie.

She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee.

Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge,

Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge.



Long Distance Information, more than that I cannot add.

Only that I miss her and all the fun we had.

But we were torn apart because her Mom did not agree,

And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.



Now, last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye,

With ""hurry home"" drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes.

Marie is only 6 years old. Information, please,

Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.



Yes, oh, yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge. I'll pay.

But which loved one is calling me? I did not hear you say.

Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie.

It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee.



Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know.

Surely you have not forgot how much I love you so.

If you would remember, dear, and sometimes talk to me.

Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee.



Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave.

You didn't want to see me off, and promised not to grieve.

My heart was torn apart, as I looked back at Marie.

And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee.



I Guess I should stop talking, after all, you placed the call.

But any way that I can help. you know I'll help you all.

Then her mother told me to come back and see Marie,

And live together in our home in Memphis, Tennessee.

Searching for an unforgotten dream?

Looking for rainbows at midnight,
Hoping tomorrow will come.
Will time erase for yesterday's child?
What will the child become?

Echoing my name, my name, my name.
Is there a choice for yesterday's child,
Seeking shelter from the falling rain?

Chasing a butterfly lover,
Making a run for the sun.
Who will rejoice for yesterday's child?
What is the game to be won?
Will you draw?
Will you fold?
Will you start playing wild?
What is the future for yesterday's child?
Will you turn to dust,
Or go to the sea, racing with destiny?

Born to be yesterday's child.

Here come the stars tumbling around me
There's the sky where the sea should be

Among the pine trees half forlorn

Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing in the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing was for baby Jimmy Brown

(Hallelujah)
Lead us not into temptation, bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love

There is a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

All the chapel bells were ringing, was a great day in his life
'Cause the songs that they were singing was for Jimmy and his wife
Then the little congregation, prayed for guidance from above

Lead us not into temptation, bless, oh Lord this celebration
May their lives be filled with love

One rainy morning dark and gray
A soul winged its way to heaven
Little Jimmy Brown had passed away

Just a lonely bell was ringing in the little valley town
Was farewell that it was singing to our little Jimmy Brown

Of thy great eternal love

You can be weak, you can be strong

And let the rest of the world roll by
But if you run for the golden sun, run now, run
For you'll never be sixteen again

Oh no, you'll never be sixteen again
You'll never be sixteen again
No no no no no, don't be lonely
There'll always be new romance
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, love is only
A win, lose or draw game of chance

And you'll never be sixteen again
Remember the rainbow always follows the rain
True love may be just around the bend
So make time your friend, hearts take time to mend

And you'll never be sixteen again

That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Rocking on out into the sky

As I travel down this road, it's a heavy load, it's a heavy load

And together we'll make a run for the sun

But since you touched my hand, now I can understand 
And I know why that we can fly and we will have fun 
While we make a run for the sun, a run for the sun 

Too shy at the start, to open my heart, I couldn't chance getting hurt 

You showed me the way, how to live for today 
You were the key, you came to me and now I am free

I hear the rain falling on my window pane 

Can't close my eyes, afraid to sleep 
Cause when I do I would only dream of you 

I'm trying to forget that we ever met 
But how can I forget and dream of you? 

Afraid to sleep because I'd dream of you 
Afraid to sleep because I'd wake up feeling blue 
If I stay awake forever,we'd never be together 
So I'll close my eyes and go ahead and dream

Falls down western style

Keep me that way

Steal my heart away

Said she can make me a man

Early one morning it was drizzling rain round the curve came the Memphis train 
Heard somebody holler, and a million more, the King is dead, but Lord he still ain't gone 
But he still ain't gone, but he still ain't gone (my god, my god he still ain't gone) 

If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E. You got to put on your coat and your T-I-E 
If you want to catch a rabbit in an L-O-G, You gotta make a commotion like a D-O-G 
Like a D-O-G, Like a D-O-G (oh yes, just like a D-O-G) 

Good Lord have mercy, what's the matter with me? what makes me want to love every woman I see? 
I'm rating one another, I'm rating again, everyone I see looks like the place I came in 
Looks like the place I came in (hot dog) looks like the place I came in (the place I came in) 

Lord I got my name printed on my shirt, I ain't no ordinary dude ''cause I don't have to work 
I just got to town and I'm gone again, but it's a different track, but it's the same old train 
It's the same old train, it's the same old train (oh god, my god it's the same old train",Waymore's Blues

Oh, yesterday gave me you
All my schemes and golden dreams
At last it seems have come true

Until I found you, the skies were always gray
Then like a sunshine you drove the clouds away
You'll never guess my happiness
When you said yes, yesterday

Days may come and go but one day you'll know
We'll live as the day of days
It was yesterday that I heard you say
I'll love you dear always

Roy Rogers,"I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more.
But the Master of the sea

Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me.
Now safe am I.

Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help
Love lifted me.

Souls in danger look above
Jesus completely saves
He will lift you by his love
Out of the angry waves

But the master of the sea
Billows His will obey
He your savior wants to be
Be saved today

When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!

Roy Rogers,"I heard the front door closing softly              
As I awakened from my sleep                             
With the last touch of her kips, Lord                   
Like a whisper on my cheek                           

And I cursed the sun for risin'                         
'Cause the worst, Lord, was yet to come
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'
But, come sundown, she'll be gone
                                               
See the lipstick on the pillow                 
That I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord
Where she lay upon my bed

And it hurts to know it's over
For the hurt, Lord, has just begun     
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'
But, come sundown, she'll be gone

Roy Rogers,"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars",Empty Saddles

Roy Rogers,"A lonely spot, I know where no man will go
Where the shadows have all the room
I was ridin' free on the old SP
Humming a southern tune

When a man came along made me hush my song
Kicked me off, way out there
As she pulled out of sight I turned to the right
A left and everywhere

But all I could see was a cactus tree
And a prairie dog playing there
I watched the prairie dog feed on the tumbleweed
That's his home, way out there

So I threw down my load in the desert road
Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun, make the tall shadows run
Out across that barren plain

Then I hummed a tune to the risin' moon
He gets lonesome way out there
So I closed my eyes to the starlit skies
And lost myself in dreams

I dreamed the desert sand was a milk and honey land
Then I awoke with a start
There the train comin' back on that one way track
Gonna take me away from here

As she was passin' by, I caught her on the fly
I climbed in an open door
Then I turned around to that desert ground
Saw the spot I would see no more

As I was ridin' away
I heard the pale moon say
Farewell pal
It sure gets lonesome here",Way Out There
Roy Rogers,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo

As the wind begins to sigh
And the world's silhouetted against the sky

Blue moon shinin' through the trees
And a plain tiff wail from the distance
Comes a driftin' on the evening breeze

Soon the dawn will come and you'll be on your way

Until the darkness sheds its veil
There'll be, blue shadows on the trail

Someone has been found on the rocks down in the bay

Party time, place look pack
Straight to the bar, where all my thugs be at
Talk to Tommy Hill, while Rudy holdin the gat
Drippin some, wit fuckin wit shorty in the back

Nigga B.U. is gettin shots of Conayac
Cousin Randy is rollin dimes and eight black
But Shearson, wig gettin his freak on perhaps
Tonight, everything is going real right

Shorties walk by, Versace's real tight
Game is real nice, made me by a drink twice
Scream Don Lotta got drinks all night
Like Redman, nigga tonight's the night

[Chorus: x2]
Tonight we goin' get high, right niggas
Freak off, sip a little liquor
What up, in the club, blowin up figgas
Me and my 'Lanz niggas
Royal Flush, honey is you wit us

[Royal Flush]
It's gettin late, watch Red, a quarter pass three
All bent up, hennecy inside the cup
Team was fucked up, Lil Bronx was throwin up
He drink too much, the Don P had him stuck

Fadone was in the middle, of the floor about to thump
Queens Most Wanted hold it down, when it front
Flex switch it up and made the whole crowd jump
About time we can all go out and have fun

Dance around 'til your legs get numb
Superstar status, goin home wit the baddest
Wastlanz official, Royal Flush got to have it
Straight to coat check, so I can go get my jacket

Snatched it, take it the crib so I can tap it
Outside, Twinz is in the Lex holdin traffic
Jumped in the range, pulled off and started laughin

[Chorus: x6]",Niggas Night Out
Royal Flush,"[Royal Flush]
It was a hot day, fuckin wit shorty round way
Diamond reflected off the white, clear E&J all day
The ennesex pull out the driveway
Feelin like Scarface, desperado on the case
Niggas an ace, celebrate livin it great
Into your mind state, a lock front, but Flush straight
Over wound ya faith, hold it down across state
You know, fitted hat, Tommy shorts to match
Lay back, executioner of rap, that bring stat
Face the phat, tattoo on my arm, and pack gat
Never mind that, quick reflexes, I bust back
Party back to back, New York, where it's at
Hold up stop for a second, bring it back cousin
Let's have a good time, cipher wit the Dutch combine
Respect mine, that's why you live the deaf, dumb and the blind
Bottom line, let's all shine, can't be mad at what's mine
It took a lot to get these props, three shots and almost got rocked
My hustle on the roof top, the watch cop, and I'm gettin crazy cheddar
Drivin rose, Bentleys and better
The street contemplate the terror, the rhymes sever
And overdose speak broadcastin niggas leakin
Probably thinkin, I'm just a wise nigga drinkin

[Chorus 2X]
Whatever you do, you gotta get ya shit straight
No time to wait, make money and regulate

[Mic Geronimo]
While on the mailbox, sit and steamin
Peep the demon, techs were schemin, seen it in they eyes gleamin
Sorta like the shine, 'cept the thoughts son divine
Run wild inside they minds, maybe had somebody by me
My body wit lacerations, cuts, abrasions
Wounds I couldn't slide, from when the bullets started blazin
Awaken from concentration, started to skate
My heart rate, amagortex wit no brakes
Jump the gate, hit the ground on my side, but no pain
Turn around and find her comin like a runaway freight train
And play you, I see blues and cars are too
Choose or lose, ain't no option in my everyday news
Grab the heat and slide, maybe jump up in the ride
Now my nigga Flush, he like lamped on the side
Strictly sorta Cajun, relax, mind lacin
Line cooperation, now to start activation
Ill collaboration, from a team now you facin
We break nation, flew back style afflatus
I only roll daily, wit the God burst heatin
Chill, a mass mill, lay back, leave it dubblin
Money for bubblin, from 95 through recoverin
My crew smotherin, carry Benjamin's and jugglin

Everywhere I go they try to take what's mine
Remind me of the Island 'cause (still came home wit a shine
Still came home wit a shine, still came home wit a shine)

[Royal Flush] (Hi-Tek)
Official facts, I walk around heavy wit two gats
So niggas can't snatch what's mine, I watch my back
The whole world schemin on a way to get trap
I ain't mad at that, take what you want, but not mines black
Seen a lot cats get yak (for all of that)
Ain't no gettin back, this the shit that comes wit this pack
Three things, guns and biscuits, don't risk it
It's all materialistic, die over this shit
And almost got robbed by these two kids in a Lex
Wit light tent, steady movin in (said to myself they can't win)
Actin like a friend, son he got close, I bust ten
Bet these niggas won't ever snatch a chain again

[Chorus 2X]
[Royal Flush]
So next time you buy a Linc, you probably would think
About the situation it brings, for brolic shit
You comin clean, thug niggas and fiends
You got it good, they gon' scheme, know what I mean?
I'm dyin over better things, not flooded pieces
Kids die for no reason, sick believin
I wish we all wouldn't wear it even
But it if you gotta hold ya heat
Mommy always said it's dangerous in these streets
Watch out for beef, your closest friend'll be ya enemy
And stab you in ya back for ya equity
The recipe, fuck that shit, live out ya destiny
That shine ain't impressin me, I wear mine to the death of me
Straight up and down, that shit is stressin me
But basically cape on my chest will be my legacy
Remember me? I try to warned you 'fore it happen
A lot of niggas die over jewelry snatchin
Take it from Royal Flush, I did the shit before rappin

New kid, War Report, dunn blew out the court
He claim righteous, the God was jeweled down wit ices
My man locked up, in the beast, hit me on the Jag
(Aiyo son, I need loot in this piece)
I got you, already blessed up, caught hard Tommy Hill
Guess appeal, accept collect call, and keep it real
But I was locked for three, son you didn't know me
Your bitch had you sue, told you, don't send me no loot
But I survive in 'Green, shorty sent me cream, Adine
Moms like, the niggas ain't real in your team
Bring the court rap, my first weak, beef wit the staff
Son, where was you at?, called you on the jack
Heard you moved from Iraq to Iran and cold ran
Ran on me, but you supposed to be my family
Tables turned, I'm in Zoo York, you up north
I'm in the cockpit, coppin Averate shit
You in the P now, straight foul wit crocodile
Pretty boy, my little man you like a little boy
Taught you the crime life, you blame me, you weakling
Yucked up, commissary low, now you thinkin
While you locked, I got the block lock wit padlock
Jealousy and envy, towards me
Word got back to me, you got somethin for me
Musolini, yo come and see me

[several samples from The Jones Girls ""When I'm Gone""]

[Royal Flush]
Now when you got locked up, livin plush, sneakers as such
Always flipped it up, on the phone line, you ran it up
Say you stressed as such, few niggas you had to touch
Plus the shit's rough, sendin you balloons, read it up
Thug it up, keep it tight, 'cause your girl on right
It's all a struggle in life, to sell things and pay the price
But I'm wit you, can't let you down son, I miss you
But back on the streets, the police want me wit you
It's official, I'm tryin to blow them lands like a missile
Holdin my pistol, to keep it real when I'm wit you
Commissary a hit you, like Kings try to rip you
Suffer razors an issue, blowin niggas like a whistle
Geo.'s 'a try to snitch you, watch the beam before they fish you
So just lift weight, I'm layin low until release date

Stuff's a shame, wild nigga walkin wit the length
We was cellblocked, think about, Flush want the top
Put my pictures up, relax for a minute, kick it up
Watch the top cat, La Familia got the coke in that
I need a part in that, fine tango, just give 'em cash
Soup 'em up, make 'em feel wild as fuck, now what up?

I know my real family, new people try to be around me
Try to surround me, goatee, ganja leaf
Locked up chief, well let that be
Doorags and cuffies, gave me a razor, recruit me
Now I'll slang, and catch a band, til the bing
You workin in the kitchen, ice pick and now ya snitchin
You Scarface, lost ya face, is laced up
So what, you got cut, then you told police
Keep it real in the beast, same thing in the streets
Wild cats tell, play PC inside a jail
Yo me, did three, never in PC
Stand freely, Musolini, we just a heemy
Life in exile, people like we, penitentiary
Did time, all evolve wit crime

It's all to make you pleased, right!

Nothing is too strange 
When we are in this price range

You're wasting paper blood in the blaze of glory
Paper blood, on the holy ground
Paper blood, never ending story
Paper blood can buy a tiny crown
For this sad and weary clown
So he can smile and take a look around
Across his kingdom, fake as it could be
(And what's wrong with that?)
Where tears of joy're impossible to see
(What do we need them for?)
Where heartfelt laughter's not what you will hear
(And so what?)
Enough of that, 'coz it's my biggest fear",Paper Blood
Royal Hunt,"Images of winter gently move fallen, golden leaves.
Sun is hiding far behind the roof, knowing what it means
Days are getting shorter, I can see chilling tears of fall
Running down for you and leaving me
Out here in the cold

Since you left whatever I would do - nothing comes out right
I'm fighting through another lonely day, another sleepless night.
Dreaming 'bout wings to fly away, but as I was told
Brokenhearted can't, they're cursed to stay
Out here in the cold

This change of a season is over and done
Won't look for a reason, just sad that you're gone

Every single word you've ever said is ringing in my ears,
Making me remember what I had,
This burning trail of tears leading me away, into the night
Closer to my fall.
Season's changing, turning off the light
Out here in the cold

Disappearing very slow, this line of footsteps in the snow
Spirit of my better day's living on the edge
Be it so and let it be, 'coz as far as I can see
There's no way to escape this season's change.",Season's Change
Royal Hunt,"7 days build this ""perfect"" world, so beautifully unfolded... fat baby on your lap.
7 signs before you'd lose your cool, obnoxious, pompous fool?
I'd say you're full of crap.
So you're still selling that Paradise skam?.. While keeping a hell of a poker face.

The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Let daylight dry your tears;

To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,

Say the word and I will follow you.

Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

that I'm sheltered by your heart.

like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause you are my lady
And I am your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn of the power of love

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,"The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real,
Well I see a face coming through the haze,
I remember him from those crazy days.

Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred faces,
I don't suppose you would remember me,
But I used to follow you back in '63.

I've got a good job
And I'm newly born.
You should see me dressed up in my uniform.
I work in hotel, all gilt and flash.
Remember the place where the doors were smashed?

Bell Boy! I got to keep running now.
Bell Boy! Keep my lip buttoned down.
Bell Boy! Carry this baggage out.
Bell Boy! Always running at someone's heel.
You know how I feel, always running at someone's heel.

Some nights I still sleep on the beach.
Remember when stars were in reach.
Then I wander in early to work,
Spend the day licking boots for my perks.

A beach is a place where a man can feel etc.
People often change
But when I look in your eyes,
You could learn a lot from
A job like mine.

Isn't flown like a flag
I carry it behind

Here in my brain.

Have parents that seem so cool.
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way.
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues,
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll let me stay.

Why do I have to be different to them?
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend,

I have to work myself to death just to fit in.

How did our two worlds entwine

Back when first we met
Oh, we thought for fun
One night together might be nice
Oh...oh...but fun turned into love for both of us
So now we pay forbidden lover's price

Oh, ‘cause love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy), oh…oh…

Nights when you're alone, you know that I
Laid with someone else beside me
Oh, but you love me still and I love you
You know I would no matter where I'd be

Hey, but love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
You got to pay some agony for the ecstasy (For the ecstasy)
Oh, love like ours is never, ever free (Free)
We got to pay some agony if we wanna have ecstasy (For the ecstasy), oh...

Hey, got to pay some agony
If we wanna have an ecstasy, yeah…eah…
And we need each other desperately, don't we, baby
And I'll never from you be free, no, no
So you'll have to do the leavin' me, yeah

Royal T,"Another day, I cruise at the beach
Car sitting low, my homey's in the next seat
It's the Royal, rims clean with the top back
Rep for summer with the locs and the baseball hat
Down 805, cuties in the next lane
Trying to draw attention, their number and their name
We didn't get no play we got ignored
But there's too many cuties in the sea to fish for
I pulled up in the spot in the parking lot
Sipping on a 40 at the corner 'cause it gets hot
Cutties checking out the cars that we roll
Black candy with the rims with the booms and the gold
Here comes the pigs, turn it down they're getting nearer
Checking out the vatos with the dice in the mirror
But we ain't villains that be stepping out of line
We like going cruising with the cutties in the summertime

From the coast to the avenue
Our crew is deep, I thought you knew
Hitting switches in my 64
Baby don't you know
We be rolling

Baby don't you know
We be rolling

I said trucks rolling by with the boom-booms in em
I sling Sly shirts with the Levi denim
A late night tings in after day time
Vatos looking loco, hynas looking fine
The veterano's got the switches to the side
The truck's full of amps in the back of the g-ride
Everybody's styling, Profile's Low
I'm driving real slow, looks like a big car show
I peep the cutties with the light Brown complection
Gotta bust a you and go the opposite direction
Pina Coloda, room at the Ramada

Parties at the beach if it gets any hotter
Cholos in bandanas, nobody's down to bang
Let the rags hang, it's a Mexican thang

Cooling by the shore, hynas cooling in the sand
Lotion in their hand with a summertime tan

I said homies kicking back in the shade drinking brew
Have one or two, but they're down to drink a few
Too many drinks when the evening arrive
Pass the keys to the homey, it ain't safe to drink and drive

Four five burning, sea breeze blowing
Ladies dress sexy, body half showing
Trying to draw attention, Latino had I mentioned
Pack in the glove, don't forget about prevention
When we hit the motel it's almost 1 o'clock
Everything closed so we head to Heidi's Taco Shop
Cutties want to roll, the lab is where we sent em
Taking em to the room, we did the wild thing with em
But we ain't ones to wine and dine
I'd rather cruise at the beach with the cutties in the summertime

Hoping I could find a place
I'd be more than just a face in the crowd

Turned the lost into the saved
Now You're showing me the way
All along I've been believing I was living

But now that I'm free I finally see
Living's worth dying for
Buried with You
You're making me new
The old me's dead and gone

Your love stepped into the world

No more living with these broken pieces

I have been searching for you lately
I've been wounded and from what I hear
You have the remedy

They told me You would be for me
So now I need to know
Is this a love that can save me

Will You stay with me when nobody is around

Can you hold me together
Can your love reach down this far
Can you hold me together

Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Royce Campbell,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making

I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul
Royce Campbell,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Royce Campbell,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Royce Campbell,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Royce Campbell,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Royce Campbell,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Royce Campbell,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

What else could I do again

A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

From Heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

[Verse One: Royce]
An angel from the lost, spite headband, marked dead man
Innermost thoughts locked, dangling from a cross (what)
The hotter the heart, the harder - wrapped up
Crucified with my chest up, felt forsaken by the Father
Wounded rebel (oooh) in Jerusalem
Gettin picked on, and whipped by the goons of the Devil
Black man, 5 foot 9, see the dawn when he stares out
With wool hair and feet of bronze
Birdstick, a black staff with brown handle
Backtrack; my first kicks, brown sandals
In the breeze of the surgeon, surrounded by merchants
I'mmaculate birth, conceived by a virgin
Do a lot in the lyric, due to the true and not living
Pure as the white driven human inside of a spirit
Or the Cathedral, that's only a quarter illegal
Slaughter the people, all for the forces of evil
Exterior armor, transparent, non-vivid
The last grand wizard slash serial bomber
Here it is; I'm Heaven sent, livin in Hell
All-seeing eye, in hand of the pyramids and keep watchin
Out for the death while the beats knockin
Plot by the Devil in a blue dress and chief stockings
Spiritual last, equipped with physical mass
Able to think quick and bring miracles to pass
The lost wonder of dark days to breathe light in
Christ titan, cough thunder and sneeze lightning
Control the thoughts, procore, feed the gators
Sole mediator of code in the Holy War, in front of the mobs
And a storm comin in March
Locked in the physical form of the son of the God

I wake up... and I don't know where I am..
I wake up... and I..

[Verse Two: Royce]
The true and living son of the son, thorough
Tongue swore of war, speak and slash son of a gun
When the rumors started I departed - I don't know
some old shit about me being placed in a tomb in the Garden
Listen here you lost, I was tortured and died for the cause
And got caught, disappeared from the cross
First into a lesson and learned of my return to the Earth
in the form of a perfect human specimen
The written jeweler, driven from the face of a leader
Slave of the people, in the form of a hidden ruler
Satan's descendents, put a break in what they intended
The hatred is ended - sway the other way of the sentence
Bells'll go and tell, defendants'll go to jail
Hot coal on ya trail, sinners'll go to Hell
I got a soul for sale, well;
Let's start the bidding at a tragic death
Who knows what's finna happen next?
Cousin of death, with predictions that I can promise
Gave it to Nostradamus and now he touchin the rest
The heart caller, balancing birds on my finger

Huh?
We the best, Twist' you at nigga c'mere
Sift ya lye
c'mere

Extremely hard to be the king of a city it's dis
A nigga that could twist like this
A nigga that could rip any shit that he get
Never balk and come with a metaphor like this
Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this
Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us
Never catch us catching the bus
Niggas got whips, niggas got loot,
niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)
Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring
Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up
Rhyme till I can't rhyme no more, ball till I can't ball no more
Till I'm 5'9"" no more, till the ice can't shine no more
Which ever comes first, let's go nigga

[Chorus: x2 (Twista)]
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!

(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)

[Royce Da 5'9""]
One of a hundred niggas'll hate my shit
Eighty-nine'll bite, the other ten'll think of coming alike
Cuz my shit when it come to the mic, 99 outta 100'll like
Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm
This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch
Never gon' fail, never got plans of catching a L
I'ma forever prevail, whatever you yell
It's my world, everything else, c'mon nigga

Put a bullet in yo' gut, bat em down and leave the sto' cut
Cause homie you ain't got no choice ta,
That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers,
we coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride,
and hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off,
and coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?

[Royce]
Listen, yo
Little Royce Nickel Nine, eyes wide with sight
With a future as bright as the light in the eyes of Christ
Ready to take on the world and whatever is in it
Proof read, sign, and seal whatever you finish
I can only lead you while you're on your quest for knowledge
I'ma teach you to have sense and to respect the dollar
Hope for the best, and you'll see, your world will be solid
I'ma teach you the truth, even behind worldly logic
This is life, cut and dry, days is bright, nights is dark
Fights get sparked, it's almost like to get ahead
You got to be twice as smart, the realities of life is harsh
Just know that God's keeping you level
He'll even speak through the ghetto to reach you
Just to teach you that the streets is the devil
Everybody's dishonest, different
Which means that we're dying by livin'
Oblivious to the time that we're given
So you don't prepare for the death, you live for the life
And live right like, do right by your kids and your wife
Have fun as a child, yo them years is precious 
The future brings fear and stresses as the year progresses
You're gonna turn a lot of them down, you're gonna feel rejection
You're gonna tell a lot of lies and you're gonna hear confessions
It's a two way street when you deal in his presence 
Only your life can show that everything is real in this message
This is life

[Chorus]

[Royce]
Yo, the whole world is upon you, the pressure is on
And you can probably sum your life up the best when you're gone
Upon the creation of all men, destiny's born
For us to reproduce, so you can keep the legacy goin'
I know you think I'm Superman, but I got weaknesses too
I keep a firm leash on things by believing in you 
And after I'm gone I live on breathing through you 
And anything I had in this life, I leave it to you
Aim for the sky and fly till you come back down
I had you the baton and you run, till you come back 'round
Let your heart tell your temper, ""Put that gun back down!""
Dry your tears up and turn that frown upside-down
It'd be plenty to cry for, think life, not death
You got much more to live for than to die for
But you got to stay humble 
Cause just as hard as your work to get it
There's people working harder to take it from you
Cause life, something that people take for granted
As time passes, you're gonna want something back
But you won't get it cause history is made every second
So you crave every lesson and save every blessin'
No matter how you view the world yo, you never will get it
The world will be the world through the eyes of whoever is in it
But things ain't gonna always go right
Look at it like, yo this ain't your day, but this your life, and live
Life

[Chorus]

[Amerie]
There will be trials and tribulations
But don't let them, don't let them, don't let them bring you down
I said you better keep going to your destination
After your darkest hour the sun will come around

This is life
Yo I don't care, I don't care if this song don't sell one copy
That's not even what it's for
It's for you, my boy
This is life

Yo, yo, I roll with the wildest crew in the game
Niggas that'll put two in your frame
With any one of the guns we carry to cock
Aim, only to use on one of you bums, too scary to box
Gimme mines and mines only, you know
Nigga you only a hole which shows in the tone of your flow
The iller the team the iller the regime
Peeling from the scene in trucks, we getting cream or what?
Robbery's the word over extortion
Force niggas to fork over a fortune
Taking you cats into a world you probably ain't never even been before
Before we can even talk
There's money to be made, niggas want to get paid
I ain't playing wit y'all niggas, I'm serious
Try to top the flow or stop the dough
You could get shot fo' sho', your whole block could go
I'm taking the pistol to make it official
Hollow heads make him an issue, making 'em hit you
Feel the force of a real nigga in this
My niggas'll tear the club up

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9""]
Yo, yo, yo, we attack the last nigga that blast
Take him for cash; if he broke, we kicking his ass
Simple as that, either the fifth or the mac
Cripple the cat, you too if you think you could rap
Who fucking with me?  Gimme one name
One nigga with versatility like this
Ability like this, it's like this
With me, my flow, you never know what you might get
Prime suspect, and I ain't hit you with half of the rhyme just yet
Niggas wondering why I be calling myself the King
Shh, I'm the King
Who you ever seen that's doing it like me?
What new nigga done came that'll spit shit
That'll sit in your brain, yeah I'm doing my thing
A lot of you niggas'll probably be intimidated by it
When my shit gets played, niggas riot
Shit gets sprayed, but you can't change that
I was doing that in sixth grade
You can take it to the streets with us
All out war, fuck it, everybody heat could bust

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9""]
Yo, yo, my attitude done changed since I became a king
I'm a stranger being, rearranging things
Now that I can afford a Range and rings
I sit and think, I remember when it became a dream
Now I'm living in it, taking the game
To where it's never even been visited, what's my name?
Royce 5'9"" (who?) hottest nigga in rap
How I'm figuring that?  I'm iller than y'all
Plus all my niggas be more realer than y'all
More crooks and way more killers than y'all
Hot with it with goals, trying to die with over two hundred songs
Ready to go like 'Pac did it
Niggas is out for the cheese
There can only be one King, it's either me or about to be me
We bringing heat with us
Ready to shoot, y'all niggas better recruit, you ain't deep enough

Even if it means puttin you under the pavement
Drop while I'm foamin at the mouth for dough, money I taste it

Snatched out of his whip
Fed to the dogs, get an ultimatum or pick
As to what he want to get hit by ? the rott or the pitt
Up in the 'burbs, chillin with nothin but birds
We cash checks on the third
And when I say that I'm out for the green
You know a nigga mean every aspect of the word
(Yeah) Walk the street
It's a nigga that stalk you, chatterin your teeth
Runnin your mouth until I pull out with the heat
Tellin you that talk is cheap
And it'll cost you true King of the king
Nigga with more beef than a war chief you can't defeat nor beat
Smile at the sight of a thug, then I go right for the blood
This nigga thought he was cold so I hit him with more heat
(Blaow!) Niggaz don't even deserve to breathe
How the fuck is you servin me?
I'm the nigga with the pump ready to dump all nine shots

You don't want to fuck with this, what's all of this
You might as well un-ball your fist
You think the real niggaz fight with fists?
Let me be the first to tell you that it's all a myth
I ain't playin with y'all niggaz, it ain't a game
Real niggaz recognize the real

Wit Shady, and poping my glock on the block to dropping on Koch!
Mistakes that I've made, I've learned to regret
Impatiently we blazing them AK's, to earn the respect

Where my name is mention is fear, compared to that shit

Then I learned in any grade in my school
(I) could have made you today, (I) could raise ya brow
On a label that's foul or made you on radio play
(I) could guide myself, through the game myself
Give you the chills, kill hip hop, and save myself

They figure you die, I learned they take away my wealth
All these niggas that used to page me, everyday that I dealt
But they all gone, y'all wrong, (I) page myself, because

To be in the lab, wit young man, making a track at least

To blow up and grow up, back and away from this rapping beef shit
All of that should cease, cause I feel like quitting
Back to the factory, rap for ME, when I feel like spitting
Go out and kill a clown a day, don't call me Royce no more
It's Ryan, I just threw Detroit's crown away!
It's only so many times, I could let my temper get tested
I can't handle it, I'll eventually get arrested
I'm on the verge of doin some things, that won't help - shit!
Take myself away from my family, is so selfish
I can't help shit, lately I been ignoring rules
You taking care of too many people, to go and lose

My father want me to bring product out without Slim
And prove them wrong, they paid my bills
I'm on your heels, I'm for real, my shoes is long
To feed my son, I will leave you

Leaking in the street, I will heat you to kingdom come
The king will come
Wait 'til you gone in place of a angel appear to take you home
The beard on the face is gone
These bullets is straight razors, blazing you, case in point

Amaze the rap game, make 'em point
Walk inside of the house of the illest and case the joint
And take whatever I want, out of it
Now that I'm wise, my future rides on it, it's time for triumph

[Royce Da 5'9""]
The whole misconception with me
The only thing people think that I'm arrogant when they don't know me
That's what it was
If I wasn't a real nigga the shit would not bother me but it does
The shit is not fair
Just picture yourself looking in the mirror trying to change what is not there
When niggas stop speaking
Them phone calls get slow, I'm feeling like Nas before he dropped ""Ether""
I appear to be sober
I'ma really be running over whoever said that my career was over
Whoever gave me the cold shoulder
And turn they backs on me, I'll be blazing you from both coasts
Believe me, I got Lil' Homie and July 6
So you funny acting ass producers, I don't need you
You can keep yo' beats, rap for money
Fuck you and everybody else who acted funny

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9""]
I'm calling every nigga out in the game
That tried to go against the fire and douse the flame
I could shout yo' name
But nobody stands out more than anybody else, you doubt the same
For every nigga that say I'm hiding
Just because I ain't hanging out at the same places I once vibed in
Everybody at my father's job asking him rumors, shit
Stop as my dad soon gon' quit
If I can, maybe thank him for raising me
To think like a baby gangsta, crazy temper
I paid my sentence ? totaled out the prison
The game sent me, fame owes my name plus interest
But once you strapped in to the penmanship
And the track rumbles, you trapped in this rap jungle
When you can't come through, sales are numbers
The one who prevails'll be the one who remain tumbled

I took some time, to redefine my style
I, kept my cool, summers behind the clouds (uh)
You lames can't put me in the same category as a rookie
Nope, my name ain't new
Rappers can't push me, as high as I can
Push myself, you not inspiring (uh)

Delivering the kind of murder, koch don't deserve

Look out for me, I will kill yo roster

While these rappers kill each other, them Jews they stick together

Am I Young MC or a one-hit wonder?
Is it a following that supports me

Can I hold my own
And rap without having to go back to Pharrell or Poke & Tone?
Can a married man still appeal to broads
Knowing everything he's spitting from here on in gon' be raw?
Can a nigga simply spit that real shit
Just for niggas that feel me, or will the system kill me?
If I drop this album and it sells
And the next one don't top it, will it be considered a failure?
If I had to drop outta the limelight for a while
Would you still mob me? Hell naw!
You would not give a fuck about me
If I worked a regular job, I don't even gotta ask y'all

Now as far as my weaknesses
I have a hard time competing the chart and on SoundScan
The media base, I respect Dre for teaching me that
Money is easy to make, but hard to keep
As far as my nigga 'Los, I love him
He showed me you can do a dope album with no budget
Yeah, with lethal rhymes, they get that
He brought you into the game, he can take you out outta people's minds
Yeah (Die!) Those who feel my career will die
Those who choose to leave me behind
Are confused cause they don't hear me cry, rather ya ears
Is ready or not, I know you can hear me now like Mary J. Blige

More serious than holding a loaded gat to me I sold my soul to a bottle of Patron
And my favorite uncle died of an illness alchy related then he stole it back from me
And now he up in heaven like neph, you owe it back to me
I was taught that too much talking will make you fall faster
My actions show that I’m real I ain’t got to broadcast it
I called you and said that I had to fall back I had to recover
And here we are, that’s for my brothers

Look, the love I got for ya’ll goes unsaid
Was there when me and shorty unwed
For that I’m always down to pump lead
We formed a bond against the cowards
Only grew over time in the studio for hours
And tours with no showers, and towns I never heard of was no small fort
But we was all sports, Slaughterhouse t-shirts in our ball shorts

Watchin' the dude, the product move quick as them dudes from ""Blow""
Did it, leave room to grow
Bigger than the hood that you can't leave like ""The Truman Show""
Why even bring your DAT's when I am the king of rap
Matter fact Nottz, bring it back
Go! Watch me
Now you say 'Maybach' in your rhymes because it rhyme with 'laid back'
Like that's the only thing that it rhyme with
How about come up outta your braze cap
Right under the train tracks, with one of your ladies
You gonna get laid flat or you gonna behave
Put this gun to your wave cap and get under your waves
Because you keep the nine witchu - you gettin your mind lifted 
Quicker than knockin 'em men, I'm too blowed to rhyme witchu (whoa)
Them loc's in Cali I know be them pie-flippers
Doin' drive-bys on lowrider bicycles (bloaw bloaw!)
You little weak guys should keep 
The murder case you beat to yourselves and throw up the peace sign (peace!)
One of my niggaz beat five
I call him Homicide Juan, I'ma sign him then free Shyne
But I don't let the battle rap haunt me
Cardier band frosty, wearin' what a fan bought me
Somebody get this avalanche off me, the van hawk us
Cheeseburger servin' faggot ass tarts
Hang with them chaldeons, them Taliban talkers'll
Beat the pants off you for bein stand-off
Or, get your tan darkened, from the heat from the flame
From the thang speakin' sayin' ""Keep your hands off me""
Pullin' all of y'all cards
We dangerous, only games we play is ""Callin' all cars"" (call all cars!)
We all drive reckless, change cars like Baby
Make Flex say, ""y'all on some Wyclef shit""
For those that don't know
We just picture a soldier with a rose gold soul with a frozen, flow
Who will rhyme 'til the climate is cold
Diamonds in the rose like Pocanos snow
I'm like Alpo, AZ, Rich

The best part about my career is probably being able to
Do what I love doin all the time, which is, make music
The negative side of it
Is probably just being away from my family so much
'Cause I find it, like an MC like myself
One of the many ways I can make money, is to pack up
And just, take my show on the road, youknowwhatI'msayin?

Niggaz money gettin glowed, niggaz gonna get 'bows
And they gonna get sold, on the road
'Cause at home they denyin to feel me
Labels wishin that they signed with the real me
'Cause now that I rhyme with the feeling
That I am on, is dyin to kill me
But I am a soldier, as I'm gettin older
I'm takin my show on the road

You can find me, up in a quiet, town
Like Ohio, tyin' it down (on the road)

Like a show you, go and come back with, dough
That's how shit goes (on the road)
And it's nothin' to cop or re-up where you come from
It's how shit goes (on the road)

Yeah, yeah
I'ma give it to you 'til you leakin'
The problem with me is that I speak with the nine-millimeter
The problem with me is that I ain't equal
Prove it to you, pull you a line out of people
That movie you starrin' in is rated are
Because I am the sequel
But I'ma be triumphant at least speakin'
Ridin' through the Chi or the D or the D.C
Movin' fifty pounds weekly
Lookin' at the south region, thinkin' about, am I greedy? (nah)
If I ain't, I don't eat inspired by Hennessy
Ridin' in Tennessee (yeah)
Fuck around and meet me
Shuttin' down everything from Uptown to up and down Beat Street
But I am a soldier, you know what I'm about
In the drop, I don't slow, when I go, on the road

Like I, I see hip-hop goin forward
Why'know you got, people buyin' into, basketball teams
And, all types of crazy shit, why'knowmsayin'?

That niggas take when they thirst, hear me out

Here's a little story, I got to tell about
A couple dudes who didn't know so well
They didn't get a chance to blow but they could flow so well
This is the perfect time for you haters to go, oh well
Let's take it down to the Noila where them boys is warriors
They notorious for ordering more then just hits, so
Take heed, I seen dude in the V and the D
He must of been moving with B.G.
Before ""Slow Motion"" I heard dude was so focused
On the street credibility, he's a ""Soldier""
Would he rather have beef or exposure?
I don't know, I never met em
I just know that I ain't trying to forget em
As soon as he went home, the place he got the most love
Niggas popped up and shot him in cold blood
At the worst time and they crept up behind em
And uh, just rewinded em

Story Two!
I said boy, would you boss up and get this money
For my niggas who ain't here?
Bring the trees, and blow a huge cloud in the air
For niggas who move without fear
Gotta pour more than a beer, nigga pour out a fifth
Fuck it we rich nigga, pour out some Cris
A young nigga got shot up once, put in a wheelchair
Still liked to light up blunts like ""look, I'm still here""
It's so true
He came out of the hospital with way more money, way more jewels
Roll through, any hood that you want in the city of Detroit
They playing one of his tunes
He probably should of been with a goon
He stopped at a car wash
I guess the dude he was with ain't know what to do
They crept up on the side of em and
Put the nine to em and, just rewinded 'em

Story Three!
We bout to take the NYC, they know about him in the NYC
But they don't know him in the D
As far as emceeing, this nigga was crazy
Motherfuckers used to say he was better than Jay-z
The first time time I heard him was 9-5 ""Ebonics""
I played it and all my niggas was high trying to rewind it
Them niggas was like, ""damn""
This nigga said that a snot box was a nose
Without stopping the flow and I was like, ""man""
I swear to God that this nigga's a problem
I think he better than Nas
He's so ahead of his time, you play his music in 0-6
This nigga sound regular now
I heard that he was thugging, had a brother who was thugging
He was sitting on a stoop and he didn't see it coming
They crept up in front of em and
Put the gun to em and, just rewinded 'em

Yeah, the street's got a code

Unwrapped right there in the room like Christmas
My mind has been designed to do light distance
Run whole laps around y'all with my thoughts
You ain't hold back on yours, naw that's my fault
Now picture me fallin, all the way to the bottom
And I'm layin and callin, somebody come help me
Find my strength to stop drinkin this poison
'fore I drown my gift, and yeah it's probably unhealthy
Cause I went so hard and woke up sober
I lost my good friend and broke up soldiers
Loco, goin hard as a locomotive
Self-loathin like I ain't chosen
Chose to bless souls, get exposed
Just know that I ain't foldin, huh
I gotta shake this

[Chorus]

September 18th, 2-oh-oh-6
I roll up in the court thinkin ""This should go quick""
On some couple thousand dollar suit type shit
From behind thousand dollar Cartier scripts
I witness my world tumble down like bricks
Two words she slurred, and it sounded like this (this)
One year (one year) travel through the room like moonlight
Through the darkness, ooh it's heartless
How could, I beat two felonies then
Turn around and lose like (lose like) like this!
My lawyer sayin stay calm, people sayin pray for him
They lockin my black ass up, like Akon
My wife at the crib goin crazy
Pregnant, yellin ""I ain't havin no more babies!""
People sayin Preem ain't fuckin with me no mo'
Niggaz in the pen' lookin homo, NO!
I gotta shake this

[Chorus]

(Yes!) Fresh outta jail feelin like Christopher Walken
The king of my city, swingin my dick as I'm walkin
Up to the 7-50, I open the door
My 'cause and like several bitches make up the decor
I look in, he got a company porns
I tell him ""Nah I'm good, I woulda chubbed her before""
I'm a new man but I could fuck with a whore
Nigga my dick's so hard it's probably touchin the floor
Ridin round in the back of a black luxury toy
Gettin sucked, like niggaz cannot FUCK with me boy!
When I look in the mirror, all I see is the real
You niggaz shouldn't be here, R.I.P. if you will
I'm the moment of truth (truth)
I'm the only significant thing roamin the scene soon as I go in the booth
I'ma do it this time, I'm feelin really defined
Unsigned to signed, nigga the city is mines

[Chorus]

Bitch get off me!
Yeah, get off me!

Now do that make me a liar?

Never had success 
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess 
I have lost, my only friends 
Now it seems I have to start again

Went from goin' somewhere about to die 
Went from callin' my chick a chicken 
Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs 
To callin' your piece a chicken 
Cause she got no teeth and she got crow feet around her eyes 
How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas 
Count to five, these birds gon' hit the ground 
And they ain't from out the Sky 
Went from havin' an outta-this-world-flow, 
To doin' the video, doin' the coon dance 
To watchin' my good friend Eminem winnin' a moonman 
I remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit 
Lettin' 'em stay with me, long story short, 
They tore up my corporate apartment 
Went from bein a kid addicted to basketball 
To bein' an ignorent nigga addicted to alcohol 
Round and round we go is how this movie would end 
Self-proclaimed King of my city, 
Not really just truly the King of losin' a friend

In the park who's true to his ark would lose 
Or win just by givin' his thoughts 'n' views

Might even hear Ryan kills

Intellect as ion I don' went from high on pills 
To triumph, to hidin' from bills, to buyin' buildin's 
Then I went from writin' for Dre 
To wonderin' if my head was on straight on the sidelines 
Feelin' I forgot about listenin' to ""Forgot About Dre"" 
From there I went to about a bottle a day 
Tellin' who we know ""Get outta my face!"" 
Okay I know what Kino said about Dre 
I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake 
But if it wasn't for him doin' that, what would I be doin' today? 
If it wasn't for Cassius sayin' that he gonna beat my ass

Every morning Kenny wake up 'bout five am, 
And jog about seven miles before class start. 
Had dreams of being the next superstar, 
Like that boy who sang Bo'. 
Kenny's ambition was crazy, 
In his heart he was determined to get it, 
So he stuck wit' to it. 
Six days out the week Kenny hit the track, 
With his goals set high, he ain't turning back. 
Lost one too many friends over guns and crack. 
Kenny put it in his mind there's something better then that. 
His daddy called him flypaper the way he stuck to the track,
His momma said ""it's your time baby you can't turn back."" 
And through all the blood, sweat, and the tears, 
Kenny promised the fan for forty years 
To come, got to get it. 
He shall prosper, 
Jumping hurdles in life 'til the next one pop up.

Hit the trap house and stay there til its five am.

Middle finger never up, that's a substituted waste. 
Why would he do that when can just tell you niggas ""Fuck You"" to your face? 
He could fill up y'all with Philly's boulevard bully, 
To pull your card with no regards for the laws, wearing a hoodie. 
Police on his trail, he toss the bird, 
Roll his window down like ""Can I help you office-err?""

It's a battle I've got to win.

For starters I'm all about the bread
I ain't no artist, I'm a target
I'm like the landlord, hip-hop's currently fallin' down the stairs
""Your rent's due, motherfucker!""
Now who give a fuck about who bar is the hardest?
When the DJ's think they bigger stars than the artist
Ridin' around in Ferraris doin' more ""A"" and R'in than the ""A"" and R's
And half them niggas don't even scratch
That's like the blind leadin' the blind leader
Hip-Hop is like the FBI in the trap readin' the Don Diva
It makes no sense
It's ironic how I can straighten you though I stay so bent
I'm about gettin' ends
Every time my money's on hip-hop, that's every time the house nigga wins
Flood in a drought, love in the club, Crip Blood gun talk

You get yo' ass whoopped on the net, you a pop icon

"Royce da 5'9""","Yeah
I wanna share some shit with y'all
All truth, all truth

Like I'm standing inside a Tabernacle
I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
I started out as a battle rapper
All I knew was Maxells, ADATs, DATs and gats
My name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
Recovering alcoholic, I grew up on 9 Mile
I'm not a gangster, drug dealer or thug nigga
Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
Sometime around '95 I found my calling
And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
But now let's talk about me, specifically
Three brothers and one sister see
My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
Hallelujah I'm the son of a addict
My addiction was music
All I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
Listening to Redman and Heltah Skeltah

Aye y'all remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called... 
Sean Price be like, ""I'm not sure any"" yeah that was my shit
I used to bump that shit all day
By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist, I didn't want to be anything else
You know, but my mom had plans for me, she wanted me to go to school, so you know

To make mom's happy
I took some general courses in college
Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
Because the bus stop I had to walk to
Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
Now I would have to assume that
It was either meant for me to be rapping
Or meant for me to be laughing at God's
Geographical humor
As soon as I stepped foot in the open-mic it was like a reunion
I was a shoe-in
I met Kino there too
And he asked me to manage me
And that was back in like, let me see
'97, my girl was pregnant
Hurdles was prevalent
And nigga it therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
And the way he started blessing me, uh
I guess before my inner-demons got the best of me
Like sneezing was my vice
Needless to say that December 29th was the day I became a believer in fate

Okay now it's December 28th, my day is goin' great 
Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
I got a call from my girl's people saying she in labor in the hospital right now, 9th floor
I get on the elevator
Elevator stops on the 5th floor, elevator opens up, my uncle's standing there crying
Now I'm caught off guard, I'm like, what the fuck?

My uncle standing there like ""Ryan, they that way""
I walk out, I see my momma and that entire side of my family
Looking like it's some kind of drama happenin'
I said ""what happened""
They like ""Granny's been in a bad accident, and it ain't looking good""
I'm like ""man, what?""
I'm having a baby four floors up
Before I froze up
I'm trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
Or maybe chose me
To ride in this emotionally roller coaster
My momma said ""the baby here yet?""
I'm said ""maybe""
She like ""maybe? Baby, go see""
I walk away feeling like a good father, the same time as a terrible son
Get to my girl, she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited
She got to get to 'bout nine 'til it's that time
And meanwhile I'm more popular in this hospital than the doctors
Nurses watching, whispering like ""that's the one right there
Who got the lady in labor on 9 and the other lady dying on 5""

By this time I don't even fuckin' remember that I got a show
Somebody had to remind me. The doors was already open at the venue
I got emotions runnin' every which way
All the nurses and stuff is like, 
""We'll keep you posted about the baby, we'll keep you posted about your granny."" 
I didn't like seeing my mama like that, so I had to get out of there

Yeah, I hit the stage at 11:50, killed it
I got off at about midnight
With about six types of different emotions floatin' around inside me
Hopeless, tryna find me
Hopin' in time God'll guide me
In the future, just as I was about to leave out
I saw Kino talkin' to Marshall and then he introduced us
We talked about collaboratin' and how chasin' this rap thing is aggravatin'
But I'll get back, I got the family waitin'
I get to skatin'
As soon as I get to the hospital they tell me that my granny didn't make it
She just died, I'm feelin' helpless, it hurt me
On the flip side, my little boy is healthy in the nursery
I picked him up, looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
Ain't no denyin' this is the power of God
I said, ""I love you, Granny"" and looked to the sky
Like even though he just got here, goodbye

This is how the story goes
Powerful day
Powerful day
Most significant day in my life
I mean, aside from meetin' my man Marshall, my son bein' born and my granny dying on the same day
My grandma didn't live anywhere near that hospital. I learned a lot this day
I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out 
For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny, and gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son, 
Little Royce, it showed me that God is real. God is real.

Röyksopp,"What is that vitalizing sound?
Calling me
In my head
Repeatedly

What is that visionary sight?
Before my eyes
So prominent
So mesmerizing, turbulent

You've got a hold on me
Your ingenuity
Seems to be driving me down on my knees

The force you generate
You reinvigorate
Your body talks and overstates

Well, I'm already drawn
Close to the divine
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind

Embodiment of sin
Has kindled me within
Sensations seems to multiply, they're building up inside

Cutting through the night
Radiating light
I've seen you move the crowd
I know what you're about

The stories I have heard
The talk about excess
I know what people say
But surely you impress

Charismatic pill
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one

A universal force
An autonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

What have you done to me?
This candid chemistry
Emotions running over me

And when you arch your back
Just with a stare like that
Well, it's natural to interact

I'm not holding back
Ready to commence
Caught up in your blizzard so confusing and intense

Synergy of two
Energy gone wild
See the stars align to spell your name out in the sky

Never seen a sight
So fascinating right
A symmetry between
Dirty and pristine

Calling out so loud
Beautiful and true
Mystery about
Everything you do

Charismatic drug
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one

A universal force
An autonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

This electricity
Injected into me
Emotions running over me

And when you're getting close
You touch my innermost
A feeling deep inside me knows

Wonders of delight
Cutting through the night
Know you've got it all
I can't do without

Burning in my veins
Ripping through my soul
I'll never be the same
A secret can't be told

You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one

An autonomic high

A chain way vision, all bright and clear
And they talk and they dance

I was expecting something pure with a golden hair
Arms full of bracelets and smoke in the air
And they talk and they dance

Here comes darkness, just afternoon
Waiting for a sign
If I survive, I'll worship the moon
Or something, anything

This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet
And now I know I'm not alone in here
And they talked and they danced

Two elements, collide in my open hand
Making me a viewer, I am water and sand
And they talk and they dance

Your hand on my hips, speak friendly to me
I've been studying for years, patiently
Is this as far as you can take me?

Röyksopp,"There was a time when all the shadows of these tall buildings
would throw their cape around each corner of the grassy fields
And one by one each huge shade would color the green with black
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us gaze upon the world we've created
Let us rest our eyes upon the great machine as we wave goodbye
Feel the evening breeze caress us while the cities are dying
As we watch it fall into a modern state, a modern time

Remember when we'd hear the distant sound of human life
A zillion noises whimper as they travel through the sky
And one by one each new sound has faded away with time
Allowing changes that we could not have foreseen

Everybody let us say goodbye to all our notions
Cause it's not enough to say that we're humane when we're left behind
It's too late to think that we can worship human emotions
Cause we've already evolved into machines in our minds

I saw them rushing to your car
In a moment all went screaming wild
Until the darkness killed the light

I remember running to the sea
The burning houses and the trees
I remember running to the sea
Alone and blinded by the fear

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in the sand
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

I remember running to the sea
Remember falling to my knees
I remember gliding off the shore
Until I touched the ocean floor

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in the sand
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

Rozalén,"Fueron cuatro los segundos que pasaron
Hasta que pude encontrarte entre los rostros congelados
Y pasó una eternidad al mirarte y contemplar
En tus ojos reflejada mi mirada
Y hoy bendigo las razones casuales por las que
Decidiste elegir mi banco para esperar, para encontrar
Fue tu rose, fue tu aroma, despertando mis hormonas,
Lo que me obligó a cerrar la mente y respirar,
Y controlar la activación

Y mi razón se convirtió
En buscarte entre las calles, en los parques, tiendas, bares
En sonrisas y destellos de cristal
Quien siguió la consiguió
Y esta historia comenzó a brillar
Y un buen día te atreviste a confesarme que tenías
Tanto miedo a que yo supiera de tu realidad, y no comprendes

Que no es tu signo positivo
En que invierte en conflictivo, las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora
Tu quien me convierte en la mejor persona
Y si tengo que gritarte lo que siento
Te digo que te quiero con tu suerte, con tu mierda,
Con pasado, con presente, con o sin enfermedad
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos
Y tú no vez que quiero seguir comiéndote a besos

Y es que el miedo que yo tengo es simplemente
No poder saborearte lo suficiente
Es dejarte escapar, es vivir sin apostar
Por quien juega con la mano más potente
Son tus ojos, no tu sangre, los que arrastré a mi cama,
Cada noche y cada día al despertar

Y es tu sexo, no tu sangre, el que se adentra protegido
Entre los huecos más oscuros de mi intimidad, y no comprendes
Que es tu risa, no tu sangre, quien contagia de alegría,
Las esquinas, los rincones de mi vida
Que eres tú, que no es tu sangre, quien invade de felicidad mis días

Que no es tu signo positivo
En que invierte en conflictivo, las cosas del querer
Que eres tu quien me revuelve, que eres tu quien me enamora

Que la historia pierde siempre la memoria 
Y la vida es circular.

Dime qué hago yo con esto que me araña tanto dentro, 
Dime qué hago con la tela que antes me arropó, 
Dime qué hago con mis labios 
Y estas ganas de besarte. 

Y dime tú, 
Dime cómo se controla el pulso cuando rondas cerca, 
Dime cómo ir de frente, Dónde puedo esconderme, 
Dime qué hago con tus ojos 
Y estas ganas de mirarlos siempre.

But maybe deep inside. You'll find out nothing is the same

RPWL,"Two weeks without a single word
Walking through the churchyard
You'll find the way out on your own
We still don't reach each other
And when the leaves start falling down
They cover every trace of you
I never chose to be around
There is no redemption
Damn we never had a chance
Please say goodbye when you leave me
Wreck my life
Don't tell me why?
Should I stay
When I feel the rain is falling down
Why should I stay
When I feel you're not the only one
You set me drifting once again
Must have been a thing you said
I always tried to be the way
You tried to see me
Now that the final tear has been shed
Don't say goodbye and deceive me
Wreck ma life

Sure I wish that I'd been right

Left behind me who will pull me from
The jetstream with its surface sunlight?
Nothing is left that can't be done
So let's try to kiss the sun
Sun- Let's take a trip and try to kiss the sun
Sun- Let's take a trip
On my way to space the blinding beauty's rising
With us longing to make it to the moment

Of your greatest triumph
Think of the time when we were young
And we tried to kiss the sun
Open your mind to motion always on the run
All the thoughts that cross my mind become
Undone ? Are we caged inside a universe
Of light? Two of us we count as one

And with the call of the nightingale
I make my way
And fly into the dawn
Must have been a long long time
'cause I can't recall our last date
at the picture-show
waiting for a smile
So I hide behind the glare of
an open-minded stare
Gathering the snapshots of my life

And when you turn the page
The pictures of you fade to gray
Waiting for a smile
All the way I tried to be
(With) all the reasons that were so
important for my life

And there was nothing left to
say about us anymore

You shut the door like many times before
Drowning in your past
I'm searching for release
Where is the hero riding with the wind

Words we say
Look at me now
Reaching out to you
Cause all the way your are
All the way you feel
All the way you live
Is how it ought to be
Never let it bring you down
I cannot face the world without you
How I wish you were around
There's still a place for us to fly to
You'll never fit into this life we live
I'd catch you if you fall
You? You should have seen before
Talk to me now
There's no single word I wouldn't try to
Understand
I worship the ground
That you will walk with me
Cause all the way you are
All the way you live
Is how it ought to be
I thought I never did nobody wrong
Where do you go? What do you do?
There must be a chance to live our dream
Cause it's all because of you.",You
RPWL,"Silent tears are streaming down
Gather to forbidden streams
The shifting clouds flowing entangled
Shadows edge the scenery
Thoughts collide with chained emotions
Seems like they were born again
The last glow of my dying senses
Erupted from the end of all our dreams
The gentle art of swimming
Swimming through our live

Through worlds of every colors
Screaming their delight
Passing through a sudden silence
Single echoes died away
Seas of light in three dimensions
Climbing through the atmosphere
Followed by my cosmic ego
Childhood pictures blurred by time
Every point of my emotion
Resolves itself again in all my dreams",Gentle Art of Swimming
RPWL,"On a distant shore, miles from land
Stands the ebony totem in ebony sand
A dream in a mist of grey...
On a far distant shore...
The pebble that stood alone
And driftwood lies half buried
Warm shallow waters sweep shells
So the cockles shine...
A bare winding carcase, stark
Shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...
Dry tears...
Crisp black squeaks tore reeds
Make a circle of grey in a summer way, around man
So don't ground...

'Cause if I did, I would have done much better
There'd be no one suffering from anything

Wondering if they have peace in their mind

Heading to nowhere

The closer I'll be to the hole in the sky
And all the words unspoken you told me
Soon they'll fade away

Riding on top of the clouds
Up into the gleaming gold of an afternoon
I set my controls for the heart of the sun

Braindead from a working day
A cold wind on this Monday afternoon

This place still holds the magic
Even though I did the best I could
All those years ago are running 'round my brain

3 lights shine through the darkness
To unlock the great wide spirit of my life
3 lights: the same old feeling comes again
And takes me home

No delay expected
So I wait, let life pause for a while
I see three lights in the distance, drawing near

Yesterday you came to pick me up
And take me far away
But today you come again to take me home

Three lights shine through the darkness
To unlock the great wide spirit of your life
Three lights: the same old feeling comes again
And takes me home

In the veil of darkness

Leave the empty platform far behind

As I'm rushing through the night",3 Lights

Much too late to find our way
It's dark

I can't recall the day before the end was near
Together now to sail away

We're bound to reach the end
A restless life
With endless needs
I'm sure we are what we believe

We're bound to reach the end
The final goal
Within our reach
At last we all unite

Only a few are blessed with fearlessness
Seeking the guidance of their heart
And find love with

All the strength inside they rise into the air
It's not the end, it's a new start
Again

We're bound to reach the end

So many can't find what they were looking for
Scared of being all alone

Lost in a maze of faulted reason couldn't find their place

Upon your dreams

Breaking with the self I was before
Now that times have changed
My memories are old, much too old

Sitting here, watching the river flow
If only you and I could say hello
Listening to the sound of silence
But you don't hear it anymore

You should have told me that it got too rough
I gave you everything but maybe everything was not enough

All I have seen, I can't tell you anymore
All I have been, so many things that we don't know
Caught in the tide of time
If only one last wish was left
Everyone should reap what he has sown

The flowing water takes my soul away
A last farewell with nothing more to say
But behind the rippling waves I will
Become part of the river once again

So it's time for me to go back on my own
My new self joins the unity and keeps the river flow
This is not the right time
Our path will cross and we will meet again

You should have told me that it got too rough
You asked for everything but maybe everything was not enough

Enthralled to see the other side

When maya comes and sets our hearts on fire

Lighter than a tuft of feathers, dancing with the rays of light
Digging oceans with my fingers, patterns carved into the sky
The creation of the earth is in my sight which no one's seen before
Sparkles of awakening knowledge shiva calls your name,
Why don't you sleep?

And all our dreams are rushing to the river
The river that has always flowed
When maya comes and sets our hearts on fire

Frightened and weeping
I read my name on a tombstone in a graveyard I don't know
In another dimension sitting with a pale face
On the hill of the dead!
The clouds all painted pink
Me wrapped in white cotton, nobody can see me at all
The letters of my name, iridescent and melting in the sun

Unsatisfied and restless, seeking in wrong places
Wading through a sea of my desires
When I burned away my bonds
I knew that I could not remain the same!
I left a fragment of my soul
Knotted in a tree top as a present for the endless universe
My form is full of light
As I'm going to the woods to find myself again

All the good, all the bad
All the pleasure, all the pain
All the yearnings of the brave,
All the sun and all the rain

All the beauty, all the dirt
All the love and all the hate
All the laughing, all lamenting, the acceptance of our fate
All illusions that we have,
All our secret fairytales,
Are doomed to slow decay; are flowing down the stream.

Never look back what is left
What has been before

When new stars are born
A new day is dawning
Don't be afraid of what is gone
Or fear what's still to come

Laid bare with space to take a deep breath
We dance alone while waiting for the changes to begin
But can never reach the place where it began

Now a new sun is rising
Hope I can do what ought to be done
Break with the past to follow my heart
To reach for the last and final goal

Was only china in our hands
And all the sunflakes in our hearts
They turned to tears of endless seas
Today's no longer real, the time has changed
The sun will rise again
Like the lonely Kings and Queens
I'll off my fears away…

When the Master calls,
Don't be afraid to say ""Farewell""
