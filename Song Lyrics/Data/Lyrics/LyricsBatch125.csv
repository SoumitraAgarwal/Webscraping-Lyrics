Frank Black,"Maybe you got faith
In where this is going
Maybe I'll pull up the stakes
And I'll be letting go

I could not believe
I could not believe
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness

You know a lot of times I think how big
And I feel lost on the zag zig now

I could not believe
I could not believe
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness

And some of these people are just so lame
I don't feel like a pupil
Just a loser on a game show

I just can't believe it
No, I can't believe it
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness
Can I get a witness, witness

I'm rooting for you
And I toasted when I heard about you
And how you got a witness
A citizen maybe in another place
Here comes the wind
I'm a chaser
It's time to leave
Here comes
It's time to leave

Can I get a witness, witness

Can I get a witness, witness
",Can I Get a Witness
Frank Black,"On the inside
You're hot
On the bright side
You're not
Teach me reach me
You'll like it a lot
Little loser
Big head
So unpopular
No shit
Never have fun I just shake my head and sing

Everybody got the beat
Everybody got the beat
Everybody got something stuck in their head
It's not nothing
I'm just
Just unpopular me

On the inside
You're hot
On the bright side
You're not

Everybody got the beat
Everybody got the beat
Everybody got something stuck in their head
It's not nothing
I'm just
Just unpopular me

Everybody got the beat
Everybody got the beat
Everybody got something stuck in their head
It's not nothing
I'm just
Just unpopular me

Frank Black,"Ahh ahh ahh
I can't stay, yes I know
You know I, hate to go
But goodbye, love was sweet
Our worlds can, never meet
And I cried just a little cause I love you so
And I died just a little cause I have to go away   
Can't you see, how I feel
When I say, love's unreal
So goodbye, it's been sweet
Even though incomplete
And I cried just a little cause I love you so
And I died just a little cause I have to go away

Every night, I still hear
All your sighs, very clear
Now love's gone, gone away
As I once heard you say
And I cried just a little cause I love you so
And I died just a little cause I have to go away",Just a Little
Frank Black,"In between the matter I would fall
Like the notes between the chords of this song
Impossibilities would be great
I could attend I would not be late
For the gathering of the society of the

Oddballs though everybody's different 
Oddball I might as well be all alone in time, not
Oddball 'cause time between the oddballs is so very long

Okay now I'd like to talk to all of you about Math
Mathematics moves at such a crawl 
And gravity is mighty strong
So strong that everyplace is an orb
So many places I count I cannot absorb
Yeah but every now and then there is a

Frank Black,"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

Frank Black,"Well, I've been hanging down-side up
Feeling really banged up
Wishing everybody would shut up
In the village of the sun

Well, it?s more than just a little bit loud
But I'll be more than just a little proud
To think that the opinions of rocks and of clouds
Would even give us recognition

Oh, I echo, it decays
I hear a sound, it is delayed
And I know that help is on the way
To the village of the sun

To the powers that be
To the powers that be
To an hour to be

Is it the intention of that child
To be a bastard in the wild
Eventually move to his inventions
Like the invention of a cannon

Of course a cannon makes a ruckus
Or like the lady in that circus
Oh, we could try and maybe fly us
Right out the village of the sun

To the powers that be
To the powers that be
To an hour to be

But maybe I've said enough
And I wasn't trying to be all funny
And I wasn't trying to be all tough
I'm almost done

Doesn't matter what I say
Or for that matter what sayeth thee
And ain't that the way
In the village of the sun

To the powers that be
To the powers that be
To an hour to be
To an hour to be

Frank Black,"with your feet in the air and your head on the ground
try this trick and spin it yeah
your head will collapse
but there's nothing in it
and you'll ask yourself

where is my mind
where is my mind
where is my mind

way out in the water
see it swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
animals were hiding behind the rock
except the little fish
but they told me he swears
trying to talk to me to me to me

Frank Black,"Today I felt my heart slide into my belly
So I puked it up with liquor
And I slept right where I lay
And I dreamed the backs of cards
For the faces were not telling
No, I never have felt sicker
And I do not want to wake

Here comes another nightmare of you again
Another velvet nightmare come true again
I should have seen it coming
Oh, please don't let it end
My nightmare of you again

No I never would have come here
But I my eyes they would not focus
So I took my last three dollars
And I spent them on a drink
I had visions of you, dear
But they floated without notice
All these drunkards do is holler
'Til this drunkard cannot think

A curtain falls
A scene grivoise
It seems your blue eyes listen

Here comes another nightmare of you again
Another velvet nightmare come true again
Oh, I should have seen it coming
Oh, please don't let it end
My nightmare of you again",Another Velvet Nightmare
Frank Black,"Is there a place
That you can't go back to
Is there a town you can't even enter

Maybe there are whole states
You don't even wanna pass through
Are you gettin' down now, you're a weekly renter

Is your mind gone, are you dog-tired
Do you feel like you can get no worse
I'm a big guy, can we try this
I will be the whole universe

Will you be the centre
You burn inside me like a star
An atom in my heart
An atom in my heart

Is your mind gone, are you dog-tired
Do you feel like you can get no worse
I'm a big guy, can we try this
I will be the whole universe

Will you be the centre
You burn inside me like a star

An atom in my heart

I know a place
Yeah it was made for you

Frank Black,"At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

I know that time is gonna take its toll
We're gonna pay for the love that we stole
Ah it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah but our love keeps coming on strong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We'll steal away to the dark end of the street
Just you and me

If you take a walk downtown
And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by
Oh darling please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me
Oh you and me

Frank Black,"Had no life
I was feeling like
Some kind of unfinished project
I had a friend John
He said let me turn you on
To the saint of Inanimate Objects
Go find, go find your saint

Pill by pill a miracle occurred
The whole world got better
How I prayed until I said the words
I knew would upset her
She said get off your knees and don't tarry
I ain't gonna be what I ain't
Go find, go find your saint
Go find, go find your saint

I packed my bags
I never did look back
But I'm glad that I met her

Go find, go find your saint
Go find, go find your saint
Go find, go find your saint
Go find, go find your saint

The union was gone but I sang my songs
At the Hall of the Felled Tree
Under the charm of the Saint's folded arms
Well I hope she can help me",Go Find Your Saint
Frank Black,"The old churchyard is where I faded
She watched me while I fell unaided
And in my time when god's army came and got me

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

Cherry brown lips of maple
Olive creams her eyes and face were
And in that town as I walk as a deserter

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

Dance for God, dance for mating
The ritual of her figure eighting
And in my mind as I fly above the churchyard

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb

I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb
I could not find my honeycomb",Honeycomb
Frank Black,"I knew a girl
With sad blue eyes
Put out the feast
I lost my psychic prize
I did forget
What the tarot maid did say
I burn today
I burn today

Our house was filled
With many birds
She said to me
I can understand their words
The land will shake, so run away
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

She said have fun
Its time has come
Hold my heart strings
And have yourself a strum
No, nevermore
This song will we play
I burn today eh
I burn today

And as I drank
In old Paris
She lay her cards
Just to see what she would see
Down by the water you'll find your happy days
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

I ran so fast
Into the north
No snow on me
And so he said thenceforth
I let snow fall
On frozen yesterday
I burn today
I burn today

And if my head
Is hanging down
I feel her arms
And her legs are all around
And we make love
Beside the waterway
I burn today
I burn today

Yesterday I will burn
For the times
I did not learn

Behold the rose
Of Jericho
How many lives
I really do not know
Though with the rain
I know it will return
Today I burn
Today I burn",I Burn Today
Frank Black,"I don't like you much
I am like a wolf
I'm not full of your hate
I'm full of my grace
See in my face
I am a king

See the empty stage
See there's nothing there
Save your ounce of despair
Your once wasted air
Your devil-may-care poisonings

Lone child, born wild
No  childish things 
Lone child, born wild
No tribal strings

I'll be moving on
Creeping off the stage
I'll be tearing you out
Tearing you down
I'm growling now
In the wings

No childish things 
Lone child, born wild
No tribal strings",Lone Child
Frank Black,"I had a castle
I had no hassles
Now tears are tassels 
You're sure to know it
Just when you blow it
Then you can stow it

My life is in storage
My life is in storage

Come take a voyage 
To personal storage
And we will forage
Leashes for my hounds
My tools for my grounds
Speakers for my sounds

My life is in storage
My life is in storage

Here are the pictures 
Of permanant fixtures
Now they're just pictures 
Lying in this stack
Bakin' in this shack 
Of things I can't get back

My life is in storage
My life is in storage

What life has become
Stored here for a sum
I hauled it, I feel dumb
Got my lock and key
Paid him in his fee
Now I wait and see

My life is in storage
My life is in storage

I believe in your perfect face
I believe in your place in the sun
Can we leave now this dusty space
Can we have a little fun?

I was standin' at the podium
Though I was a little drunk
To the darkened auditorium
I delivered my funk

You were standing at the edge of the light
Tryin' not to be too impressed
I was tryin for the sake of the night
Not to be too depressed

I called you on the telephone
From a hotel in Beverly Hills
And though I was scared to the bone
You were givin' me thrills

I believe in your perfect face
I believe in you place in the sun
Can we leave now this dusty space

Frank Black,"She showed me her pity
Lucky me
In a storm, so bad
The worst of the Autumn
She came from the bottom of the sea

Please won't you stay awhile
Give me your coat
Then we'll fall in love in my boat
You'll be my selkie bride

Please give me no denial
I promise I give
I'll forsake the life that I live

If you return again
I'll be the saddest man

If you return again
Please dont return again
Please dont return again

In crescent city

Frank Black,"Georgie Porgie used to get real high
He used to kiss the world till it made him cry
He was under the bottle's command
But one winter he got it together and
Happiness came with the warmer weather laying across all the land

He had a love she also liked to drink
She got it together
But you know what I think?
I think she was still feeling glum

She took a gun and she shot him in the head
She shot herself and so they were wed as the air conditioner hummed

Mamma killed a pumpkin
She thought it was a sweet
She put it on the table
But it was still meat
She forgot the sugar again

Daddy came home, she had tears in her eyes
He said ""Gimme grilled cheese
And paper bag French fries""
See, he forgot the sugar again

We had a wander seven years out West
It wasn't exactly the wilderness
But I felt like an Israelite

And the flames shot into the night

I know a girl who lives on the hill
I don't know if her sister will
Or I was thinking about her best friend

Oh listen to me
I'm a desperate boy
I think I better have a sing for joy
And I guess this has just got to end

I'll get away in my get away car
Every now and then I'll send my regards
From a payphone down in the flats

I'm sorry for the love
I'm sorry for the pain
I'll say I'm sorry baby again and again
I'm sorry we're joining the stats

Frank Black,"I saw three shrimps in the water
And two were old and gray
So I swam a little closer
And I heard the third one say

Goodbye mommy shrimp
Papa shake my hand
Here comes the shrimper for
To take me to Louisian'

He showed his mama and his papa
The shrimp newspaper he read
Then there the advertisement
To all the youg shrimps said

Free ride New Orleans
Stay in grande hotel
Meet a Creole gal
To help you out of your shell

Goodbye mommy shrimp
Papa shake my hand
Here comes the shrimper for
To take me to Louisian'

His poor mama and his poor papa
They haven't heard from him yet
Last time they seen his smiling face
Is when he jumped into the net

Frank Black,"I used to walk in a big black cloud
You took my hand and you led me out
A nest of demons played on my chest
You picked me up and you laid them to rest

It's a pain to be sure
We were aiming so high
It's so strange to be saying goodbye

We saw the world from an automobile
Saw the best views over 10,000 meals
Funny how an evening turns into years
Funny how we're laughing
Through all of these tears.

It's a pain to be sure
We sure gave it a try
It's a shame to be saying goodbye

Oh my darling shall we have one more dance
A prayer to the raingod to give one more chance
The water will cleanse us, we spin on the plain
Take us to the ocean to find love again

It's a pain to be sure
We were aiming so high
It's so strange to be saying goodbye

It's a pain that endures
We sure gave it a try

I saw a train light the night on fire
I smelled a spring on the smoky wind

I didn't know you were so deep
You left me standing
At the river every time

Now I'm gettin' that dog sleep
But I could not leave
I'm gettin' that dog sleep

Every day I look around
Then I put my head back down

I'm livin' on dog sleep
But I could not leave

I'm livin' on horse meat
But I could not win

But I could not win

I'm livin' on horse meat

Frank Black,"Years flew away
I saw her standing there
Our last parking lot
'Cause we didn't have a prayer
Liquid roses trying to confess

don't cry that way
Don't cry that way
Don't cry that way
Little girl I feel so helpless

The city far below
I let a river pour
Our corner room of glass
We had a sad contest
Beneath your skin you found two rivers more

don't cry that way
Don't cry that way
Don't cry that way
Little girl I feel so helpless

Do they know as they fight their way upstream
Have they a reason to know why?
Here we go into the analyzer?s dream
And when we get there do we die?

Hey brother, count the ways that I am blessed
But I am cursed with your image as a child
Silently like chicklets in the wild

don't cry that way
Don't cry that way

The world was young
Now you're the smoke
And I'm the lung

It's empty now
And there you were
I don't know how

It's so sad, it's so sad
It's too bad we bought this
It's down to you
It's down to you
It's down to you
And though its not true, it's down to you

It was raining like the end of the world
Under covers we were children curled
Or were we ancients who bumped our heads and never got out of bed?
Tell me, baby, everything I know
It's not as if we have another place to go
You told me once and you told me real nice
This is paradise

Frank Black,"Wish I was back there in New England
Playing in dirt behind the bar
Our shouting voices intermingling
With 'Little, little Willy' from the car

Back on the raft down in the harbor
Trying to push each other in
Waving hi to all the fisher boys
Going to deep-sea with their kin

Better go see Elijah 'cause he's my only friend
Yeah, there's only us two, it's just us in the end
Better go see Elijah, got nothing to say
But I know that's okay, go see him now, go see him now
Go see him now, what's that you say?

On the bus down to Redondo
We've got enough for single fare
Skating back down to the condos
Breathing in that dirty air

Well, you were right to never go back
If I had only done the same
Too many years I kept on trying
To win that California game

Better go see Elijah 'cause he's my only friend
Yeah, there's only us two, it's just us in the end
Better go see Elijah, got nothing to say
But I know that's okay, go see him now, go see him now
Go see him now, what's that you say?

Wish I was back there in New England
Playing in dirt behind the bar
I hear our voices intermingling
With 'Little, little Willy' from the car

On the cliffs above the blue coast
Was that the last time we were free?
And where has everybody gone to?
Or was it only you and me?

Better go see Elijah 'cause he's my only friend
Yeah, there's only us two, it's just us in the end
Better go see Elijah, got something to say

Frank Black,"Someone said, I should leave
Shook my head, no, no, no
Tangled web that we weave
So I said, I will go

I'm a fast man
I'm a fast man, oh, oh

I go a thousand miles 'fore I get me to sleep
You think I'm exaggerating, baby?
That ain't nothing to me
See me I'm gunning it just as fast as I can

I'm a fast man

Frank Black,"It?s sad to see your art
Hanging on the wall
So many pictures there
But yours the best of all

I like the Indian
The one in ballpoint ink
In ancient Massachusetts
Long before you called

You traded him and many others
For a drink
Your fingers thick from hammers
Well, it really makes you think
And then my father
Would fill your glass so tall

When I was a kid
I gophered in your crew
Always a kind word
And you showed me what to do

And living hammered
Well, it's always hit or miss
But through your cigarette stained beard
Your love rang true

And though you are so loved
It had to come to this
You got shut off
Because you always stink of piss
And now you drink someplace
Where no one bothers you

Oh, Fitzy, oh, Fitzy
Oh, Fitzy, oh, Fitzy

Frank Black,"I used to see you at the Ratskellar
Sarcasm of a young feller
Tall and mean between the pillars
Before you drowned in a Holland Town

You were still the muscle man
When I saw you in a nether land
Alcohol and speed were friends
You cycled around in a Holland Town

The old pea coat is loose upon your frame
Your handshake is strong but you look so short
And your face distorts
You speak no more of someone to blame

Was it here below the sea level
You set adrift your rock and roll
And you got on the dole
You lost your love to some clever devil?

I'm sorry to hear about your sister
She went too far down in the drain
She was trying to dull her pain

Come put me out of my misery

There was something about the light

From the fires on the shore
To darin' at the troubadour
Holding us in his hands that night

Was everywhere you went
But sweet blues went straight to hell

Hear the echo in the shell

Onion layers wait for you
Bounty of eternal fields

Every muscle knot I feel
Robert tell me what to do
Tell exactly what you're not, yeah

Tails pushing grand whales
Heads hope to have the stuff
Each flag had no sail

Can you believe enough?
And though Diana calls to you
She will never never yield
Every siren has her spot

Four hundred million
Oh that was very far
Robert sweet Onion

Makes me feel so tired
Another layer and layers and layer, oh no
Robert can you find your way?
Show me the way to come

Under my opposing thumb
Brandishing my shield

Into the dimming blue
Nowhere in this world

To the cinnabar one ponders

And all the plans that you're involved in
Since you're gone you'd be impressed
To know I too have been evolving
But I don't think you comprehend
I've been suffering, yeah, I've been suffering

Guess I'll be suffering up around the bend
This love is a cancer in me
I can feel it advancing in me
This fire it is my light in the world
Well, I found me a new friend
I've been suffering, yeah, I've been suffering

Guess I'll be suffering up around the bend
I hung around in a leather bar
They threw me on the cement
Slept all night in my plastic car
Got in an accident
I brushed by you in the super mart

And I had me a touch of what's real
It was real when you crushed me with your steel
Black clouds roll through my mind
Who says anyway these halls are sovereign?

I am a hater of the human kind
So keep away, this heart's not softening
No, I don't think that it's the end of this suffering
Yeah, I've been suffering
I've been suffering, I've been suffering
And I'll be suffering up around the bend

Frank Black,"In the wake of his chariot
You swam toward the latitudes
Leaving for happier times
Florida far behind

Trying your best you were
Ignoring the rescuers
You'd gone so very long
You were so very strong

The scene was so tragic
But that was the magic

Will you never drown?
Will you learn to use
Some forgotten part?
Some forgotten part?

Are you going down
Where the ballyhoos
And the tritons are?
And the tritons are?

You were so incredible
Finding all the edible
Prize of the sea
Prize of the sea

In the wake of his chariot
You swam toward the latitudes
Leaving for happier times
Florida far behind

In division pelagic
You were choragic

Just a little bit south of a town called weed

I was going to die, I was going to freeze
Then she touched me
She was velvety

She's a cat of a creature
She don't care she's velvety

kan de zwaarste steen niet zinken.""

Hearing words that I have never heard

With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign

That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Up jumped a swagman and grabbed him in glee 
And he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker bag

Up rode the Trooper - one, two, three

That the hold she had was much stronger than the love she had for me.

broke down her desires like a light thru a prism;
into yellows and blues and a tune that I could not have sung.

Frank Kelly,"Day One
Dear Nuala,
Thank you very much for your lovely present of a partridge in a pear-tree 
We're getting the hang of feeding the partridge now, 
Although it was difficult at first to win its confidence 
It bit the mother rather badly on the hand 
But they're good friends now and we're keeping the pear-tree indoors in a bucket 
Thank you again 
Yours affectionately, Gobnait O'Lúnasa

Day Two
Dear Nuala,
I cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again and to receive your lovely present of two turtle doves 
You really are too kind 
At first the partridge was very jealous 
And suspicious of the doves and they had a terrible row the night the doves arrived 
We had to send for the vet but the birds are okay again 
And the stitches are due to some out in a week or two 
The vet's bill was 8 but the mother is over her annoyance now 
And the doves and the partridge are watching the telly from the pear-tree as I write Yours ever, Gobnait 

Day Three
Dear Nuala, 
We must be foremost in your thoughts 
I had only posted my letter when the three French hens arrived 
There was another sort-out between the hens and the doves, 
Who sided with the partridge, and the vet had to be sent for again 
The mother was raging because the bill was 16 this time 
But she has almost cooled down 
However, the fact that the birds' droppings keep falling down 
On her hair whilen she's watching the telly, doesn't help matters 
Thanking you for your kindness 
I remain, your Gobnait

Day Four
Dear Nuala,
You mustn't have received my last letter when you were sending us the four calling birds There was pandemonium in the pear-tree again last night and the vet's bill was 32 
The mother is on sedation as I write 
I know you meant no harm and remain your close friend 
Gobnauit

Day Five
Nuala, 
Your generosity knows no bounds 
Five gold rings! When the parcel arrived I was scared stiff that it might be more birds, because the smell in the living-room is atrocious 
However, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings 
Your affectionate friend, Gobnait

Day Six
Nuala,
What are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity 
But the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the calling birds 
But they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head 
From the pear-tree and his bill was 68 in cash ! 
My mother is munching 60 grains of Valium a day 
And talking to herself in a most alarming way 
You must keep your feelings for me in check 
Gobnait

Day Seven
Nuala,
We are not amused by your little joke 
Seven swans-a-swimming is a most romantic idea but not in the bath of a private house 
We cannot use the bathroom now because they've gone completely savage 
And rush the door every time we try to enter 
If things go on this way, the mother and I will smell as bad as the living-room carpet Please lay off It is not fair 
Gobnait

Day Eight
Nuala,
Who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight, 
Hefty maids-a-milking here, to eat us out of house and home? 
Their cattle are all over the front lawn 
And have trampled the hell out of the mother's rose-beds 
The swans invaded the living-room in a sneak attack 
And the ensuing battle between them and the calling birds, 
Turtle doves, French hens and partridge make the battle 
Of the Somme seem like Wanderly Wagon 
The mother is on a bottle of whiskey a day, as well as the sixty grains of Valium 
I'm very annoyed with you 
Gobnait

Day Nine
Listen you looser!
There's enough pandemonium in this place night and day without nine drummers drumming, while the eight flaming maids-a-milking are beating my poor, old alcoholic mother out of her own kitchen and gobbling everything in sight 
I'm warning you, you're making an enemy of me 
Gobnait

Day Ten
Listen manure-face,
I hope you'll be haunted by the strains of ten pipers piping 
Which you sent to torment us last night 
They were aided in their evil work by those maniac drummers 
And it wasn't a pleasant sight to look out the window 
And see eight hefty maids-a-milking pogo-ing around with the ensuing punk-rock uproar 
My mother has just finished her third bottle of whiskey, 
On top of a hundred and twenty four grains of Valium 
You'll get yours! 
Gobnait O'Lúnasa

Day Eleven
You have scandalized my mother, you dirty Jezebel,
It was bad enough to have eight maids-a-milking dancing to punk music on the front lawn but they've now been joined by your friends the eleven Lords-a-leaping 
And the antics of the whole lot of them would leave 
The most decadent days of the Roman Empire looking like Outlook 
I'll get you yet, you loud bag! 

Day Twelve
Listen slurry head,
You have ruined our lives 
The twelve maidens dancing turned up last night 
And beat the living daylights out of the eight maids-a-milking, 
'Cause they found them carrying on with the eleven Lords-a-leaping 
Meanwhile, the swans got out of the living-room, 
Where they'd been hiding since the big battle, 
And savaged hell out of the Lords and all the Maids 
There were eight ambulances here last night, and the local Civil Defence as well 
The mother is in a home for the bewildered 
And I'm sitting here, up to my neck in birds' droppings, empty whiskey 
And Valium bottles, birds' blood and feathers, 
While the flaming cows eat the leaves off the pear-tree 
I'm a broken man",Christmas Countdown

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Did

I stood on that promise but you lied
I thought promises were meant to keep
But they're only words if there's no sincerity

And right now I must admit that night I had fallen in
love.
For when you looked at me and I at you 
I became confused not knowing what to do.

The night was young and I saw no escort by your side.
I said to myself ""There must be a valid reason why"".
Finally words were exchanged 
but an engagement ring killed the confidence I had
gained.

It was so unfortunate for me at that time 'cause the
two of you got married.

I should've told you that I loved you when I had my
chance
and maybe now we would be more than just the best of
friends
but at the time it seemed you were in love

Love oh love your love still had a hold on me.

kids
and now you're blaming yourself for the foolish things
he did.

You see, I never felt worthy of your heart
Seeing myself through your eyes I didn't seem very smart
To handle things the way you could or like a street

Do was say I love you

Frank Mills,"You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown
You reach for the shelf and cradle it down
The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove
Only that you need to see a statue that moves
A tutu of satin, bordered with lace
Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face
Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose
Eternally destined to remain on her toes

Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy
Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy
She's perched on her stand, and never will part
A final gaze upon her, now the music will start

You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because
You've been here before, so give one final pause
To dream of the future, to reflect on the past
Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last

The room fills with music, such a cute song
Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs
Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow
Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show

Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe
She could step off her box if she wanted to leave
So easy it is, twirl around with such grace
Staying in her circle, she remains in one place

Such a brief moment, a small time to spend
The dancing will slow soon, the music will end
In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair
How can we breathe life, how can we share
The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs
We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms
We sit on our shelves where objects reside
We don't allow the music to get right inside

Music Box Dancer's now completely alone
No winder or no listener, because nobody's home
How long before someone will re-wind the spring?
The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing",Music Box Dancer
Frank Mills,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

""Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know'st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?""
""Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes' fountain.""

""Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear him thither.""
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

""Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.""
""Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.""

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing",Good King Wenceslas
Frank Mills,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom Angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing;
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Frank Ocean,"I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-r- s dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive
Then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor unamerican girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave
Land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said I've had a hell of a summer
So baby
Don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way to far

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

Well you can have my mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Girl if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway
It's love made in the U.S.A",American Wedding
Frank Ocean,"Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special, every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving

And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust

Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving

And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust",Dust

Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn, she handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly, she's in school payin'
For tuition doin' porn in the Valley, at least you workin'

If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school, after school
Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late, off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

And everytime somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair no fair that's cheating
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair, no fair that's cheating
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more, no more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone, she stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me

Now everytime somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw

Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking it, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times

Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And every time the cops pull me over, they never see them
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good

I'm going off, don't try stopping me
I'm going off, don't try saving
No flares, no vest, and no fear

Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me;
Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.

And Mary all smiling sat listening to me;

Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me;
Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.

Her voice was a solace and comfort to me,
But the cold hand of death has now torn us asunder

And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

Frank Patterson,"Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.


Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.


Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
But as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free.
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.


Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.


Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.


I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.


I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.


Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

",Abide with Me

The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.


So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.


O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.


So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.


In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.


So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.


To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.


So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Sent from somewhere to my soul

Does it still run down to Donny cove?

Midnight - not a sound from the pavement.
Has the moon lost her memory,
she is smiling alone.
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet.
and the wind begins to moan.

Memory - all alone in the moonlight.
I can smile at the old days,
I was beautiful then.
I remember the time I knew what happiness was.
Let the memory live again.

Every street light seems to beat a fatalistic warning.
Someone mutters and the streetlamp gutters,
and soon it will be morning.

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise.
I must think of a new life,
and I mustn't give in.
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too,
and a new day will begin.

Burnt out ends of smokey days,
the stale cold smell of morning.
The streetlamp dies, another night is over,
another day is dawning.

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun.
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is.
Look, a new day has begun.

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

Frank Portolese,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Frank Portolese,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Frank Potenza,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Frank Potenza,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Frank Potenze,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Frank Potenze,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart [Instrumental]

No te vayas ahora, por favor
No te lleves mi vida con tu adiós

Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did
Did my words not come out right
Tho' I tried not to hurt you
Tho' I tried
But I guess that's why they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Yea it does

I listen to your favorite song playin' on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of
Easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has it ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you
The wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

So I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down

I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadn't past

For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too

Was too hot not to cool down

So good bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

It was just, just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit 'bout the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

Frank Sinatra,"I don't why I should
Cry over you
Sigh?
Over you.
Even be blue

I should have known that you'd leave me alone
And break my heart in two
Although you have left me alone to pine
And all my love was a big fat waste of time
Someday your heart will be broken like mine
So why should I cry over you

I should have known that you'd leave me alone
And break my heart in two
Although you have left me alone to pine

Frank Sinatra,"I took each word she said as gospel truth 
The way a silly little child would
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood
She didn't mean it
I should have seen it
But now it's too late

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams
Now it seems 
This is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long
I can see the way this ends
She's gonna turn me down and say 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air
Why should I cry
Heave a sigh
And wonder why
And wonder why

I thought I found the gal I could trust 
What a bust, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?
Frank Sinatra,"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though she's some other place, her face I see
At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there

She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up there above
I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
That she's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love",Dancing on the Ceiling
Frank Sinatra,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And I'm deep in a dream of you
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you
Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, ev'ry mem'ry I'll keep
Deep in a dream of you",Deep in a Dream
Frank Sinatra,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves, then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy, what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store? should I phone once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two",I Get Along Without You Very Well
Frank Sinatra,"I see your face before me, crowding my every dream
There is your face before me; you are my only theme
It doesn't matter where you are; I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes, and there you are always

If you could share the magic, yes, if you could see me, too
There would be nothing tragic in all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I can't erase your beautiful face before me

I'll be around from now on

Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart

Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same, never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same, never be the same again",I'll Never Be the Same
Frank Sinatra,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so bright
Ages ago, last night

Today, the world is old
You flew away, and time grew cold
Where is that star
That seems so bright
Ages ago, last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now let's reminisce and recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young [*]
Frank Sinatra,"This love of mine goes on and on
Though life is empty since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day
But oh, the night
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break
Since nothing matters, let it break
I ask the sun and the moon
The stars that shine
What's to become of it
This love of mine

And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet

I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And I'll close the way I do

Frank Sinatra,"When you were very young, the world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring you loved so well
Now the young world has grown old, gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count your fingers, what can you do
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender, why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue",Little Girl Blue

And Friday makes me feel
Just like I'm gonna die

But after pay day, is my fun day

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again
Starry eyed again, takin' a chance on love

I thought that cards were a frame up, I never would try
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love
Now I prove again that I can make life move again
Um, I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love

They're only gray for a day

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

May not be new, but I like it,

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words, ""I'll love you 'til the day I die""

When love congeals it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

Frank Sinatra,"So I walked a little too fast, and I drive a little too fast,
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?
So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.
Do they know, do they care,
That it's only that I'm lonely, and low as can be,
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.
So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare,
So I go at a maddening pace,
And I pretend that it's taking her place,
But what else can you do at the end of a love affair?

Love locked out may never come again,
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears,
But no one ever hears love calling.

Though we need the precious gift it brings,
We don't heed the song of love it sings,
On the door love beats its tiny wings,
Just love locked out.

A world without love is a world without life,
A sad world full of gloom,
So please make a place there for love in your heart,
It does not need much room.

Love is well worth the waiting for,
When it comes knocking at your door,
Fling it wide, for love locked out will come
No more, no more.",Love Locked Out

Same things happen everyday, not a thing to write, not a thing to say

I'm in bed each night at nine, p. s. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain, but all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train, p. s. I love you

They came around to call, and I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say, and so I'll close but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you, p. s. I love you
I do my best to obey all your wishes, I put a sign up ""Think""

That hopeless scheme, only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care
And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new

It well could be the one time

Just another who knows your laughter and lies.
I wish that you were someone who was half as lovely, twice as true.

While I still remember the tune

We used to dance instead of walk
We used to sing instead of talk
Why was our love song that used to be
Only the start of the blues for me

But songs are funny things, they never really die
And so my hope still clings that someday you will try
To just remember the words

One song I must admit still fills my hopeful heart

Or it might be the sound of your hello
This magic I hear
I get misty

The moment you're near
You could say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty

And too much in love
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat and my glove
I get misty

Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left

Frank Sinatra,"Alone from night to night 
You'll find me too weak to break the chains that bind me.
I need no shackles to remind me, 
I'm just a prisoner of love.

For one command, I stand and wait now 
From one who's master of my fate now.
I can't escape for it's too late now, 
I'm just a prisoner of love.

What's the good of my caring 
If someone is sharing those arms with me.
Although she has another, 
I can't find another for I'm not free.

And the promise to be near each time you call

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They will give you the world for a toy
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy

Frank Sinatra,"In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call The Gypsy,
She can look at the future and drive away all your fears,
Everything will come out right if you only believe The Gypsy,
She can tell at a glance that my heart was full of tears.
She looked at my hand and told me my lover was always true,

Frank Sinatra,"She is watching by the poplars,
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes,
She is watching and longing, and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies,
And a song stirs in the silence,
As the wind in the boughs above,
She listens and starts and trembles,
'Tis the first little song of love.

Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,

And the roses will die with the summertime,
And our roads may be far apart,
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy,
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart

Till the shadows veil their skies,

And look into her sea-blue eyes,
And she sees the road by the poplars,
Where they met in the bygone years,
For the first little song of the roses,
Is the last little song she hears:

Roses are shining in Picardy,
In the hush of the silver dew,
Roses are flow'ring in Picardy,

Frank Sinatra,"London by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn to gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square 

Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There´s romance in each cigarette glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau

Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He´s not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
While each Londoner dreams

My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light

But lovers love London by night",London by Night [the Frank Sinatra Collection]

Frank Sinatra,"I never cared much for moonlight skies, I never wink at fireflies,
But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light.
I never went for after-glow, candle light on the mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light.

Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark,
Then you came and caused a spark, that's a four-alarm fire now.
I never made love by lantern shine, I never saw rainbows on my wine,
But now that your lips are burning mine, I'm beginning to see the light.",I'm Beginning to See the Light
Frank Sinatra,"When I hear that serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know, many moons ago.

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory, serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday, the small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away, I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark, serenade in blue.",Serenade in Blue
Frank Sinatra,"Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame

Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says ""From Macy's Mezzanine"".
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl

Frank Sinatra,"In the blue of evening
When you appear close to me, dear one
There in that dusk we'll share a dream reverie

In the shadows of the night  we'll stand

You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along

And everybody has the right to be
It can be a real delight to be
And I'd fight, fight for the right to be wrong

Frank Sinatra,"You're young for a golden moment, you sigh and it flies away
And then in the silent September, you dream of the music of May.
You're young for a shining hour, but soon it's remember-when,
Take hold of that golden moment,
For once it's gone, it never comes back again.

Frank Sinatra,"You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
Your song's beginning while mine's nearly sung
Don't wait too long

Fall is a lovely time of the year
When leaves turn to golden brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin' down

Why must the moments go by in such haste
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming, I've no time to waste
Don't wait too long

So while my heart's gay and foolish
And free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me

I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet, not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone
All of my mem'ries are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own","Hello, Young Lovers"

The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow

How old am I, I'm not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words I love you reach my ear

Don't mind these lines beneath my eyes
They're well earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter
And occasional tears
And I hope you won't be jealous
Of the silver in my hair
It took many lover's quarrels
To put it there

How old am I, you kiss me and I'm young
Love's a road never traveled
Life's a song I've never sung
If I make you happy today
I'm the perfect age
As for tomorrow turn the page",How Old Am I?
Frank Sinatra,"That year in Oakland High
When I was seventeen
The grass from there to San Jose
Was high and cool and green

I see it now
Too brash and young was I
To know what time could mean
The old Acacia lawn cut down
Was felt but never seen

I see it now
That world I knew is lost to me
Loves have come and gone
The years go racing by
I live as best I can
And all at once I know
It means the making of a man
I see it now
I see it now
I see it now",I See It Now
Frank Sinatra,"When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it
Lonely early, doesn't it
Every single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it
Lonely early, doesn't it
Still the old heart's young enough to say

It was really more than lovely, wasn't it
Truly lovely, wasn't it

Every single lovely day",It Gets Lonely Early
Frank Sinatra,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real, so bright
Ages ago, last night

Today, the world is old
You flew away
And the time grew cold
Where is that star
That shone so bright
Ages ago, last night

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now lets reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung
When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Frank Sinatra,"I've seen that face before
That face that I see in the mirror
I know that face, I've seen that face before
I knew that dopey guy
When he didn't know how to tie his tie
He stood right there and he had hair galore

The man in the looking glass
Who can he be
The man in the looking glass
Can he possibly be me
Where's our young Romeo
The lad who used to sigh
Who's the middle aged Lothario
With a twinkle in his eye
He seem so much wiser now
Less lonely but then
Could be he's only pretending again
Man in the looking glass
Smiling away, how's your sacroiliac today

Where's your first love affair
That tragedy d'amour
The true love you thought would be
The end of you for sure
Man in the looking glass, have no regrets
The man who's wise never forgets
That life is worth living if once in a while
You can look in that looking glass and smile",The Man in the Looking Glass
Frank Sinatra,"Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again

Once upon a time
Never comes again",Once upon a Time
Frank Sinatra,"When the wind was green at the start of the spring
When the wind was green like a living thing
It was on my lips and its kiss was fair
You were there

When the wind was red like a summer wine
When the wind was red like your lips on mine
It caressed my face and it tossed my hair
You were there

Then came the fall and all of love
came tumbling, stumbling down
Like leaves that lost to frost and found
They were flying, crying
In a brown wind dying

But the winter's come and we both should know
That the wind is white like the swirling snow
And we'll never see all the wonderful things to be seen
When the wind is green",When the Wind Was Green

Frank Sinatra,"Born free, as free as the wind blows, as free as the grass grows,
Born free to follow your heart.
Live free and beauty surrounds you, the world still astounds you,
Each time you look at the stars.
Stay free where no walls divide you, you're free as the roaring tide,
So there's no need to hide.
Born free and life is worth living, but only worth living,
Cause you're born free.",Born Free
Frank Sinatra,"You wander around on your own little cloud
When you don't see the why or the wherefore
You walk out on me when we both disagree
Cause to reason is not what you care for
I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart, then you take it to heart
Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

Sure, I can borrow a smoke, maybe tell some joker a bad joke
But nobody laughs, they don't laugh at a broken heart

Oh, yeah, I'm drinkin' again, it's always the same

Once when you walked beside me
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Frank Sinatra,"You are there, in autumn gold or summer green,
You are there, to lend enchantment to the scene.
I hear music, and all because you are there.
In a mist, behind a window in the dawn,

We have kissed, but when I reached for you, you'd gone...
You come and you go, like April snow,
Until I wonder, darling, are you real, or an illusion I embrace
Half a dream, the other half that laughing face

Although, in my heart, I know that you are there
You are there, You are there!","You Are There [Theme from the Warner Bros. Picture ""The Naked Run]"
Frank Sinatra,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say
I've changed, but something's lost
But something's gained in living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all","From Both Sides, Now"
Frank Sinatra,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads

By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gentle on My Mind
Frank Sinatra,"(Moody river, moody river)

Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody river, your muddy water took my baby's life

Last Saturday evenin' came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found with a note addressed to me
It read Dear love, I've done you wrong, now I must set you free
No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend

Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife

I'll never cry, my love, though every day seems like a hundred years,
For I'm just a fool who clings to his pride but when I'm alone,
I can hear the sound of rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide,
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside,
I can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart.
How could I know, my love, I was a toy, only a game to you?
How could you go, my love, without a thought of what I'm going through?
How can I forget I still love you so, it echoes each time that I hear
The sound of rain in my heart from the tears that I hide,
So it tears me apart, I still keep them inside,
But I can't escape from the sound of the rain in my heart.
I hear that rain in my heart of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside...

For once in my life I have someone who needs me",For Once in My Life
Frank Sinatra,"And I wake up in the morning, with my hair down in my eyes,
And she says hi, and I stumble to the breakfast table,
While the kids are going off to school goodbye.
And she reaches out and takes my hand,
Squeezes it, says, how you feelin' hon?
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun.
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say.
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.
There's no such thing as Dr. Zeuss, Disneyland, and Mother Goose no nurs'ry rhyme.
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis when the winter comes.
There's no such thing as make-believe, puppy dogs, and autumn leaves and B.B. guns.
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me, and grab a bite to eat.
And she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late.
But she sits, waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way and if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say.(chorus)",Little Green Apples
Frank Sinatra,"Dressed in dreams for me
You were what I wished to see
Elizabeth, Elizabeth
Love was very new
Make believe was coming true
Elizabeth, Elizabeth
You were all much too much
Out of reach and out of touch
When you came to me
I found it could never be

Dressed in memories
You are what you used to be

Frank Sinatra,"Lost in day to day
Turn another way
With a laugh
A kind hello
Some small talk

I forget
That I'm not over you

A smile to put them in
With other lives
To listen to
And some work
I've got to do
I forget
That I'm not over you

Days go by
With no empty feeling
Until I
Remember you're gone

So many shadows in her eye
So many empty dreams
So many bitter times

She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice - my arms can go around twice
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - strange to see
And all that nothing - it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny - she's OK
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone
But when she calls me: ""baby"" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
I chased her - and I caught her
Then a diamond ring - I bought her
(Hey) The diamonds shine - the ring is so fine
But here is the twist - she wears it right on her wrist
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - tall and thin...

Frank Sinatra,"The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song, it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning, just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson, in learnin' the blues
The cigarettes you light, one after another
Won't help you forget her and the way that you love her
You're only burnin', a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track, for learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory
The nights when you don't sleep, the whole night you're cryin'
But you can't forget her, soon you even stop tryin'
You'll walk that floor, and wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break, you're learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd, those blues will haunt your memory
The nights when you don't sleep, that whole night you're cryin'

Frank Sinatra,"It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It's just the nearness of you
It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby what's your hurry
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime

Frank Sinatra,"No one ever tells you what's like to love and lose,
How it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues,
How to go on living, how to face another day,
No one ever tells you the way.
No one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone,
Listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own.
Suddenly it hits you all those dreams WEREN'T worth a dime,
Cause no one ever tells you in time.
Long before the icy winds of winter,
Autumn tells the swallows, time to fly,
Why did she pretend till the bitter end
Till it broke my heart to say goodbye.
No one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to SING
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war,
But no one ever tells you before.

No one ever tells you that it's just another fling,

Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

For the last time we have tasted 
Love's sweet tears by the fire's glow.
If our hearts are strong there'll be 
No long good-byes when it's time to go.
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken,
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves 
Where they never show.

Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild.
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

When the Winter weds the Northern Wind 
The child they bear is snow.
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids 
But the trees will grow.
Sun and Earth in time will come together,
God will give us back our summer weather,
But the mem'ries of that first sweet 
Taste of love pass away so slow.

Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.

Think of all we had before,
Let me try once more.
We can have it all, you and I again.

Afloat in darkest space.
And every creature lives his time 
And knows his special place

That's flooding everywhere

We've got to walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale 
And live in love and peace.

The times have made us fearful
And our fears have brought the tears
The loneliness and darkness 
Have grown bitter with the years
But a light is just beyond us
and the children almost see
A world that we've forgotten 
And the world they want to be

When we walk with the lion,
Soar with the eagle,
Sing with the nightingale
And live in love and peace.

The ark is getting crowded now 
And each of us must know
When everything is finished here 
There's no where else to go.
The beasts are here to bless us 
And the faith is in their eyes
That we can find the garden 
And see that sweet dawn rise

And we can walk with the lion,

Sing with the nightingale

That it's no pay to relive yesterday.
I tried to hide my sorrow, started living for tomorrow,

You hurt me and abused me, took advantage of and used me,
I swear it almost made a wreck of me.

Love to you had lost its splendor, my pride went out the window,
When you left me, I kept begging you to stay.

But now my heart is healing, and I got a real good feeling,
I think I'm gonna make it all the way.
My troubles came in bunches, I kept rolling with the punches,
You'd shoot me down and I'd get back again.

I tried to be your lover, in no time I did discover
Your loving cup was not for me to win.
Your kisses weren't the same but I kept kinda fan the flame,
'Til I just couldn't take another day,

You can't blame me for trying, now I stopped my crying,
I think I'm gonna make it all the way.
I tried my best to take it, but my smiling face didn't make it,
'Cause in my heart, I knew there was no hope,

And so she takes her summertime, tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger,

It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new

It's very subtle, the Continental
Because it does what you want it to do
It has a passion, the Continental
An invitation to moonlight and romance

It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental

You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you

You'll find while you're dancin'
That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control
And you will do the Continental all the time

There would be another dream for me, someone will bring it.
Oh, I will drink the wine while it is warm,
And never let you catch me looking at the sun.

I will win the worship in their eyes, and I will lose it.

He looks like a baby when mother is near.

His hair like garden where all flowers grow,
He's heavenly eyes are as true as the sea,

Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wondrous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

Seeing images in the firelight

But I wouldn't have made it without them, here's to the band!        
Strings soaring, horns boring

I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away

I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs

Frank Sinatra,"When I was seventeen, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights

Who lived up the stairs
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone

When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive

I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me

Frank Sinatra,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song

I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can

I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his pudding-headed father ever had

I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornings for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill

[Chorus:]
Bill, I will see that he is named after me, I will
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully will toss him around

I don't give a damn what he does
As long as he does what he likes
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes

He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well

He might be a champ of the heavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of the United States
That'd be all right, too

His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be
Not Bill!

[Chorus]

And I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette
Say, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!

I can see him when he's seventeen or so
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him ...
Wait a minute
Could it be?
What the hell
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money
You can have fun with a son
But you got to be a father to a girl

She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair
A kind o' neat and petite
Little tin-type of her mother
What a pair

I can just hear myself bragging about her
My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad

She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two and three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me

I got to get ready before she comes
I got to make certain that she won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot of bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
And be dressed in the best money can buy
I never knew how to get money
But, I'll try, by God! I'll try
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die",Soliloquy
Frank Sinatra,"The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind
Warm summer wind

And the air was such a wonder
From the hot-dogs and the beer.
Yes, there used to be a ballpark right here.

And there used to be rock candy,
And a great big 4th of July
With the fireworks exploding
All across the summer sky.

When you walk by me
Lingering sunsets
Stay a little longer
With the lonely sea

When you shoot
At bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange
Enchanted land grown-ups
Seldom understand

Wandering rainbows
Leave a bit of color

Make my wish come true
Before the night has flown

'Bout a nest set apart

To this love, you were the world to me

And brought me love again

But where are the clowns, send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally finding the one that I wanted, was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines, nobody's there

No matter what the future brings

Woman needs man and man must have his mate

A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Yes, I had to call you up this morning
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

I couldn't sleep a wink last night,
Because we had that silly fight.
I thought my heart would break the whole night through,
I knew that you'd be sorry, and I'm sorry too.

Frank Sinatra,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else
Walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never head
From a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams
Spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring
It might as
Well be
Spring",It Might as Well Be Spring
Frank Sinatra,"It's only a papermoon, s
ailin'over a cardboard sea,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.

It's only a canvas sky, 
hanging over a muslin tree,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.

Without your love, 
it's a honky-tonk parade,
Without your love, 
it's a melody played in a penny arcade.

It's a Barnum and Bailey world, 
just as phoney as it can be,
But it wouldn't be make believe, 
if you believed in me.",It's Only a Paper Moon
Frank Sinatra,"Some like a night at the movies
Some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent
Home by the radio

Some like to live for the moment
Some like to just reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend
Just give me one like this

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden
A kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

Frank Sinatra,"Oh, Bess, oh where's my Bess
Won't somebody tell me where?
I ain't care what she say
I ain't care what she done
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
Bess

My Bess, I want her now
Without her I can't go on
I counted the days that I was gone
Till I got home to see her face
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
I want her so, my gal, my Bess

Where is she?
Oh God, in your big heaven
Please show me where I must go
Oh, give me the strength, show me the way
Tell me the truth, where is she
Where is my gal, where is my Bess

Frank Sinatra,"Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares
Just when you're sinking without a straw in sight
Someone starts thinking and everything's all right
Birds of a feather can never be shown that livin' alone is fun
When two hearts are better than one

Two heads together are better than one in rainy or sunny weather
The outlook can't be a glum one when there's someone who cares

When two hearts are better than one",Two Hearts Are Better Than One
Frank Sinatra,"Um cantinho e um violão
Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars
Frank Sinatra,"In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

And good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose

And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today

I want you to know anything goes",Anything Goes
Frank Sinatra,"When love comes in and takes you for a spin, 
Oo la la la, see'est magnifique.
When every night, your loved one holds you tight, 
Oo la la la, see'est magnifique.

I've been around
And after learning a lot about girls

I'm more or less aloof

I don't care if you are called,

Is the proper squire
