Gogol Bordello,"You know
It's time for a change
But how
And where do you start?

When bitching
And moaning
And frowning
And groaning
And loathing
And throwing
Has torn you apart

It has torn you apart
From deep within
Left no vigorous cell
Even in Eden you seek knothole to hell

Oh hey (Hey)
Ho (Ho)
Captain Crooked Grin
Tell me where you trying to go

You taught your parrot to stutter
Now you repeat his old chatter
But it is the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row
Oh
It's the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row

Now in the beginning there was a word
In the end there is no end
People don't live or die
People just fade in and out of the fog
We come to comprehend

And now all alone with your crooked grin
How you plan staying afloat
Even the boatsman grab Bible
And split from the boat

Oh hey (Hey)
Ho (Ho)
Captain Crooked Grin
Tell us where you trying to go

You taught your parrot to stutter
Now you believe his old chatter
But it is the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row

It's the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row

Row

You taught your parrot to stutter
Now you're slave to his chatter
But it is the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row
Oh
It's the way you name your ship
That's the way it's going to row
Oh
It's the way you name your ship
That's exactly how it's going to row",It Is the Way You Name Your Ship
Gogol Bordello,"Hey John the Conqueror
Growing on the sunny side
I've heard about you
From people of a healing kind

People of a healing kind
They said your name I need to call
If I'm sick or down in trouble
Or need anything at all

So I went on a mighty
Highway byway ride
And dancing on the roadside
Guess who did I find

I said 'Hey man, what's you name?'
And he said 'Think about,
Think about it,
'cause truth is always the same'

Living and loving
Truth is always the same
Living and loving
The rest is insane

John the Conqueror
Was nowhere to be found
So I asked about him
People of the mystic kind

People of the mystic kind
Said he's no secret at all
If you broke or down and out
Or need anything at all

So I traveled world around me
And i went back inside
And dancing on my ribs
Guess who did i find?

I said 'Hey man, what's your name?'
And he said 'Think about it,
Think about it,
'cause truth is always the same'

Living and loving
Truth is always the same
Living and loving
The rest is insane

Gather round, people
Gather round here

Living and loving
Truth is always the same
Living and loving
The rest is insane

America's people
Truth is always the same
Russian people
Truth is always the same
Asian people
Truth is always the same
African people
The rest is insane",John the Conqueror (Truth Is Always the Same)
Gogol Bordello,"Hey rejuvenation, the second wind
When, when, when, when will it begin?
Repatriation, what is my sin?
When, when, when, when will my ship come in?

First I asked the sailor to sneak me aboard
Bring me place my father showed me my first guitar chord
Place where lie of second thought cannot survive
Place where all my friends are still alive

Lost innocent world
Lost innocent paradise
Where did you go?
I payed too high a price
Lost innocent world
Lost innocent paradise
Once I get you back
I'll never sacrifice

Da da da

Then I asked every geisha from the willow town
But nobody wanted to see death of a clown
We danced Shanghai tango like no tomorrow jive
When kung fu master found me, he asked me, ""Are you still alive?""

Where did you go?
I payed too high a price

Gogol Bordello,"My birth I can hardly remember
But I remember from the start
My midwives looking at each other

To bickering they were so proud
One said, ""Life is beautiful gift, boy""
Other one said, ""Government loan""

I still don't know which one is right girl
And you know I don't really care
I got to keep my heart a-singing

Gogol Bordello,"I came back to my hometown incognito
To forget about it all
Suddenly, I heard ""hey there papito-pito-pito
You don't ever give a call""

Remember we used to skip school together
Said to me drunk girl, police man
Now, where have you been all my life
I've been skipping school since then, yeah

I've been watching trains
Swiftly rolling by
I've been jumping them
Without long goodbyes
To uncover rules of life
And how to break them well
And the key to my gypsy auto pilot
And my story to tell, hey!

So we ran to outskirts of our town
To the working man dance hall
Where all night we played piano-yano-yano
Off the chairs about to fall
Then we climbed the ladder to the attic
Where once I showed her my first song
Above the street where all them crazy dreamers
Still talking nonsense all night long

Whoa-o whoa-o
Nonsense all night long
Whoa-o whoa-o
Still writing their first song

I've been watching trains
Swiftly rolling by
I've been jumping them
Without long goodbyes
To uncover rules of life
And how to break them well
And the key to my gypsy auto pilot
And my story to tell, hey!

And we laugh, and we cry
And we recited sacred text
And we rose and we fell
And then we said, ok what's next?

But, if you keep on watching trains
Swiftly, rolling by
One day you will be gone
Without long goodbyes
To uncover rules of life
And how to break them well
And the key to your gonzo turbo gypsy auto pilot
And your story to tell

Gogol Bordello,"When the snow is getting heavy,
Trees just bend and let it go,
So how many, so how many,
Broken bones it takes to know?

So wake up, my principessa,
And don't let me out of your sight,

And it was black and white

Gogol Bordello,"Hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
Even if even if only to fail
'Cause winning and losing keep journey amusing
Down down down
Your destiny trail

Hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
So living and loving may never go stale
'Cause hustle and bustle shall get you to the muscle
And for you coffin a nail

But nothing in this life is good or bad
It's we who dress it up as happy or sad
And nothing in this life is a sheer must
Yet in living and loving indeed we trust

If you got no place where you belong
Shoulder of stranger just as good and strong
Come in to my house in middle of the night
And don't don't hesitate
Kick that door out!
Hey, kick it out!

'Cause nothing in this life is good or bad
It's we who dress it up as happy or sad
And no one in this life is sinner or saint
It's just energy running up the stream
Or down the drain
And nothing in this life is a sheer must
Yet in living and loving indeed we trust
Indeed we trust

Hey brother stranger you know we shall sail
Even if even if only to fail
'Cause winning and losing keep journey amusing
Down down down
Your destiny trail

Goin' Places,"I see you standing there in the back of the room
I can't talk to you so I wrote this tune

Thinking about you I start to write this song

Gojira,"Reverse, blow me in that black hole down there
Return through perfect circle of my retina
No Gravity
Watch Out! Hang Out! Fuck Off!
Beyond! Out Yonder! Upsidedown

I bleed on you so ease my pain,
Blow Me Away You !!!!!!!!!!!
Smash Up! wash away the blood from my body
I see this halo of dust all around
But my vision is clear
I know I don't have any forces left
To go the distance

La dame des fauves
I defy you, Artemis
Shoot me between the eyes
I want to face the day of reckoning
Reunite, I want to embrace your light

Implode, explode, both at the same time
Destruction, let me disappear, fill my empty,
Go to venus ('s)





",Blow Me Away You (Niverse)
Gojira,"Every Step you take is to the end
Chaos, duplicate the human slaves
Mother Nature so far away : Why?
Perfect is the race you dream

Right now, I make my choice
Perfection you fake is not
The soul, not a genetic code
You fools, you ignoramuses

Hatchery, the newborn to celebrate
Ashes to ashes, I see respect in the dust
Life is so perfect

Now for the weak an abortion
Celebrate perfection that grows
The flesh, a gift of science
The soul a fault of a god

Life on its way to the state of fire
From the cold taste of steel
Light embraces the dark, lava flowing free
And the cradle is
Forgot the reasons why
We all lie so pale
On the playground of cold
Mother Nature is at saturation point
And the cradle is falling down",Clone
Gojira,"Your words are so cold to me
Indisposed, don't hear your orders
Destroy the greatness of soul
Normalize what's in your hands

Take a look from the future
Get up from your dream and see
Deliverance soon is coming
For those who know
I take a sword in my hand now
I fight & kill Thanatos
Feel the ground under your feet
The roots so deep

Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

Can't control my arms
Emergy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside

For those who know, I want to be
As clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around
I hate the taste of your words

Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

I hate the taste of my lost illusions
I choose to live for the only
Reasons I felt on the ground
I want to try





",Deliverance
Gojira,"As I fight, trying to escape
Covering my soul
Watching the flames
I must understand this wizard
Fire is everything
It burns, I provoke, It's beyond
I feel, I create light

Hypnotizing power I can't resist
Reach out my hands, I feel the light
Increase flames, the heat is oppressive
Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in...

Enter now so deep the flames,
I respect the silence
Overcome with cold I pray
I see all the trees, the sky
The grass, the oceans
I embrace the world below
And I know now all the reasons
And all the countries
Fire begins and fire ends

Oh it burns, fire is all...





",Fire Is Everything
Gojira,"I want to live in the forest
Between the roots and the branches I lay
On the moss I sit, I want to rest by the river

I want to live in the forest forever
The power of trees, I want to feel forever
Connection with life, animals, and stars

Between the roots and the branches I lay
Meditate the light wide open to the stars
Speak of the whales, deep in the oceans
Speak to the planets, deep universe





",In the Forest
Gojira,"Last night, alone, I met the moon
I saw its halo and the love around
""Now take the path, don't ever lose your time
Just watch the light you have inside""

I watched inside and my eyes burned
The moon was right
Roots so deep, head so high
I want to be in and watch it out

I know the reasons why I failed
The stars illuminate my being
Behold thy servant, you the force around
That makes the planets be





",Love
Gojira,"Lost, a lion came and said
""Come, on the brink of the abyss""
Watch my feet
swinging in the great empty one
Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades
C’était un palais infini
No one else is able now to play
with the answers
And I open, my mind is so clear
There's a door in the wall of time",On the B.O.T.A.
Gojira,"History erased my story, my ancestors
But I'm still alive
Clenched fist, I bite the floor
My eyes turn to red
I raise my voice, show my fury
Wide open to the sun
I put my hands in this source of light
In that constant energy

Present at my funeral
I know I'll rise
And meet myself reborn

Sculpt entrance out of rock
Now advance without a respite
Go back to the source
I raise my head





",Rise
Gojira,"Lawyer talks, he's so correct, he is respect
He learned how to make you feel safe
And kill you with a smile
And the food so fast, the hair so clean
The moon so far, fire so weak

All those words flying in the air
Cannot see the stars
Images, colors, like wrong perfection
Wash my brain, dirty it's so clean
But who are you?
The mixture has no smell

Soon you will sit on the bench
Of those who deny I have my soul
You sell a dream you create
Condemned by what you condemned before
Smooth are the words you sing down and high
Underground is your joy your laws
Satan is a lawyer
You choose the appeerance of the futile
Trapped, a coner stops your back, you're out
Before you grow you will die...





",Satan Is a Lawyer
Gojira,"I fix my attention on this ball
Spinning round inside of me, deep inside
Revolving conscious planet
On an axis around this star
By the light

And the black holes in the vault of heaven
Make me wonder, wonder why
How matter can disappear
Are there doors in this wall to reach the light
From time and space

Now I see those mounts of fear
Feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
I can touch this wind of night
That erases our light and makes us paranoiac
But my legs are now so tired
Climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
So I fix my attention now
On this perfect planet revolving around this star
And the sun, it seems so close
I can touch the heat of presence and I know...
I can see this monster light
That embraces those notions : space and time

The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why
Light blackened? Door opened?
Swim back time, door giving entrance to
Supernova as only light
Meet the earth and all the stars
The entrance, the essence, supply us

But I'm alive for good
And I just free myself now
From all what was wrong
Break the unbreakable

Fearlessly bright
They call me out there
Order me to face the wind
My structure's alive,
My body's on the way
Don't bow down
Before the walls
Of fear and madness

And strike me down

Is running through me
Spike like beam of light

Thy serpent made of bones
Finally rise up
From the ground awaken

Beat your feet

Like banks of clouds they gather

Took off from the red place
In the sky I fly
I have lost my reason
And I've made my sense
From up there I will see
Where I'm from
And where the force of love
Will tell me now to go

But why do you say
That you are lost
If you don't even try
To find yourself
My words are a stairs
I put my feet on
And I climb through
A starless night to my place",From Mars
Gojira,"At the very first sound
There was just light
And then, a storm
Of time and space
Just came and struck
Created our time
In water life
We understand
It just only began
Forced to look to the sky
And wonder why
We cannot face the fact that
We're all scared now
Of mysteries of life
There is a mask that soon will fall
Before the strong embrace
Of love and might
Of light in the dark
I go for a quest
I have to give myself the answer
Enter now this place in the wild
I can see the glade
My feeling now is growing bigger
From the sky

I do feel like no one can save me
I am so alone and yet I cried
I called for help, forsaken
But now I know
The only was is to
Understand the living
Obey the rule of light
And face the fear
Inside out !

Lost, I found there a stone
Erected in line
With one the brightest stars
Of all the night sky vault
And I took my time
Took off the moss
Washed away the dust
And gave a new lease of life
It's mystical force
I grab it now
And praise this lord
Of earth and stone
Make passage for souls awaken
So it returns
To where it's always been
With the gods
Now coming, I feel the love
It comes from on high

I know the words
But now I feel it inside
It grows, it's there
And all it comes from the sky




",From the Sky
Gojira,"Four hundred thousend years ago
They came from outer space
And gave us life here
We are taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now
And when I see the smoke all around
I feel like I'm now
From humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head
My heart is ocean
And I feel all alone
Because everybody's wrong
I feel the living
What is this thing that we call hate
And that's inside of me
Get out of here!

A world is down
And none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes
And I fall in disgrace

I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry
""don't fear the living""
One day you will stand as a king
And now fear can erase
This light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have
This truth is growing
And as a warrior I have to fight
I can already feel
The love I'll discover

I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds
The fates all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed in
We could evolve and get older
Open your eyes and let all this flow
Now see a now hope is growing inside

We will see our children growing

I'm locked up
Imprisoned I live,
Deathlike, sickening
Strong is your hold
On my resignation
I don't see the stars,
My memories are veiled

In fluid dreams
I fall I'm restless
Walls made of stone
Are turned into water now
Enlightened demons
Are taking me by the hand
Approaching me,
The great eye speaking

Mountainous waves
Are breaking on my despair
Awaken me but I'm still dreaming
And I just plunge
Into this sea of light
Set open the doors of soul
I'm living

Lightning struck me
I see the path I was so scared of
And fly to the stars
Conviction now increasing at last
My skin is broken
I see the smallest part of me
My mind is alive
But I'll never bow to this again

Why do they call me there
How can I fly to
All this water
I don't fell like
I could ever swim to them
Whales in the sky
I feel they're so close
Inside, and yet so far away
Burst into tears, I feel sad
My dreams aflame
The force is now away
Lie on a stone,
Drop this load and cry to see
The ocean planet is on burn

To another I fly
I come with life in my veins

I left a struggle behind
And faced the fear that?s alive

To find the gates of the heart

I come to Sirius see
To learn from you friends of old
And wish to come into being
And behold I?m with you

But it's not of this earth
The water is so clear
And the birds are alive

And fly away

I lay down by the river-flow
It's a river of stars
I'm living by the ocean
It's an ocean of light

This place around us
It's a world that I once saw
In a dream

Will you please tell me now
If I'm dead or alive
Landscapes so bright
All around
It's a city of light
Were who when and why ?
I think therefore I am
I feel like I know this land
But it must be so far awayâ?¦

This world is life
There's clouds-and-wonders
It's all I need
And it will never go

I don't believe it
This is my vision
We can never know

This is the earth
But ages after
I know the world
Will overcome its' pain

I dream about it
Already makes it
Happen in the rain


It's right in front
But you don't face it
I'm dedicated
All my life in me
And made of light
Our sun is growing

Is not the only one

Simplicity's forgotten
And we all drill the ground

I refuse to be surrounded

The weakest lost in hatred
Consequence is upon my door
Responsible for my own life
I'm reborn again and again

Driven to increase my own power
By creation the purest choice
Destined to rule my life
And go the way of the flesh
Nature is my only master
I will bow to no one
The ground is dry like rock
Without any hope left
But now I decide to grab my life
With my hands
Crave for freedom build my own life
Adoration for none

Reaction is a weakness the strong cannot afford
My path is not determined by actions of others
They fill themselves with hate
Covering their faces blackened
The wolves are back and crave to kill
Slip on stones and break their legs
Try to hide from termination
But the time has come
You will have to pay the debt of nature

And now you are the one
To change the face of the world
You wield the sword the pain is left aside
And I have left my tears behind me
So I refine the way I that I know
So bright to me
And I only adore the fact that we are the
Creators
Of our own lives
Lust for power is the master disease of our time
This force alone devours the weak
And rules the strongest

So mired in convolution
It chokes the life from your throat

I don't want to destroy
The only chance I have to survive down here

The wind blows, I'm so scared
And the waves so big, I'm not prepared
I will have to be strong
But for now I cry all the tears

Now enter the storm and feel electric sword
My entire life is about to burn
I am struggling, life is illusion
But I keep the dream of a better time

This secret knowledge I receive from where I am
So precious, the treasured icons
Extended to this point, forget the ones that hurt
They all want, they struggle, they fight and try to dry their tears

We're all left on our own
We are bound yet by each others lives
Now I'm leaving this world
I will never forget the river flow

Losing contact with the living
Almighty TV plugged, hybrid empty brain
Don't see anything real in the game

The tension is building constantly
No reason just a reflex I have, driven by clockwork
I try to keep an eye open
And I realize I haven't closed my eyes in a long time

Neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
I have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
I've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
I haven't close my eyes in a long time, I am trying

I cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
But I'm here to continue, after all I have been through
I try to keep my eyes open, I am realizing
This life and death more precious than anything

I won't bring no material in the after life
Take no possessions, I would rather travel light
I'm of this kind that kills all day
But I don't know yet how to die

Art of dying is the way to let all go
Within I practice, in the secret of my soul
My shape in the reflector has
Now for ever, a life on it's own

Infected misinformed
Releasing a black enormous insect out from the chest
Archaic from disease

There is a secret code, the structure of the mind

Crawling stately along the spine
Mighty phoenix from the ashes arises

Life burns fierce, reduced to ashes
Resurrection from the flame, ageless process
Quest for absolution, out of bounds introspect
Self-consuming womb, ever present, meet no end

It seems like I always knew this
Since I'm a child I can feel it

Revolving within a circle

Over the valleys and planes

Gojira,"Reflecting ourselves in the blood of all the beings we slay
Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain
There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold
This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away

The way we all behave is not understandable
It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away
We all behave like children, taking off the head of our
Teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back

We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil
We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other
Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession
And there is so much time to kill

The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm walking, standing on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side

The way I see myself, so confused, so sophisticated
I have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore

You burn yourself, set fire for your own good
We die eyes closed, dig your own grave now
Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame

Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame
Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth

And the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under

How could I fail to understand
Cities are burning, the trees are dying
My heart awake but still
Pain is killing me, pain is killing me

Take this pestilent destruction out of my way

And the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse

The fools are kings, tearing apart the soul
The race for complication, communicate reaction
The lack of heart of men, I grow distant from the core

Borrow this body for a lifetime, earthly material
My soul unraveled out of mental
The shell returns to dust

I focus on the present, concentrate on what I find
Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
Bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
This force increases and tells me where to go

Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life
Enforce my senses understanding
I find the will to live straight

I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
Finally turned into a virtuous one
Having the whole world in my hands filled
Timelessness

Out of the frame I feel so vast I'm all around myself
Imaginative interaction
But I keep struggling inside to hold this always
Forever there

Is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding?
The only way to find the power is to look inside
Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
Now you hold this secret, appeared out of the vacuum of space

You crawled and bled all the way but you were the only one
That was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself",Vacuity
Gojira,"Anything that has a shape will crumble away, disappear
We belong to the circle life of all creation
We crawl, deny ourselves, refuse this evidence
That we project our greatest fears on death and forget our power

I want to live my life in close touch with the sacred
Pacify disturbances of the mind, I face my own death

Lower and lower is the pressure
I can feel the parts of me collapsing one into the other
Higher state of consciousness awaken
I can see the light of this next world leading my soul reborn

I find it hard to believe that this picture on the wall is everything
I do understand all the prayers, life is so sharp, hurts so bad
What does it mean to be dying, what if you take the guts and brain away?
Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life

Every effort to ignore it is unavailing, we all have to die
Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain, I have to try
This is an other dimension, you can scatter ashes to the winds
And even buried in the ground I'm still there

Do not be afraid, you are dying and the four great elements
Of your body are collapsing one into the other
It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains
The light of this world has faded completely
But the light of the next world have not yet appeared

Your breath is now still, no warmth to your skin
Do not be afraid, there's no way that you can stay here
You are leaving this world, all lights are fading away now
Leave behind loved ones and all you know
Do not be afraid and let yourself go

Gojira,"First of all you will eat all the bodies
No matter they pray for freedom they'll kill you
Forward you crush those going backwards

Voracious flames upon the earth

Second step you eat all the creation
Swallow the trees, the lakes and all the valleys
Crush the moon and drink the river flowing
Deeper than ocean blue
Burning all that, burning all that

They teach you how to conquer and rule the world
The towers that you built so strong, no man can touch
They tell you how to find and raise the fears
And let them grow inside of your heart, they need no walls

Is there a chance you face the void inside?
Winds of doom will blow your pride away

Behold the bright lights coming down on time
Before these altars black made for your sacrifice
You take for granted what's been there for ages
Inside the womb the new blood gets ready to fight

And when this fire grows, it does it so we can't remember
The meaning of this life, we'll be marching until the end

Had not taste for more lies, we are standing alone
The bright treasure found has no price and no name
In the light of this star, with the forces aligned

This is how we talk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this alone, we bow to no one
Carved by the waves, our sacred temple
Sing the praises of no flag, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to an end now
Our conviction untouched, we build a life straight
Intelligence of heart as only guidance",Liquid Fire
Gojira,"There's a river of time
Let us worship this god of destruction
On nothing we can rely
All is gone, belong to the past

Everything changing over and over
We're all falling so fast
Keep on burning
Overwhelming power
Keep on burning, change

The old me didn't survive
Inexorable transfiguration
There is something at war

I'm nowhere to be found

In the air I dissolve
I'm fading away

Keep on burning, change",Mouth of Kala
Gojira,"Crawling and moaning in the sharp blade of grass
All my life starting over, blood spilled inside out
I went through this cycle of pain deep in myself
Destroyed by awful hands, a demon of illusion
The pain now awaken, I'm cracking wide open
Can barely recognize my body, a battlefield
Unquestioned pride once so fragile
I cannot even recall names or faces
Those standing on my side

My side
I am nothing the pain awake is forging me
Face down, inert
Forcing me, dreams haunting me
I am immense, I am awake, renewed
Lost in the darkest time
I know I felt their presence
Even if I was blind
Pain, please forgive my ignorance
My master",Pain Is a Master
Gojira,"Created weakness for the numbers on the board
Absurd amout of things, obsolete creation
The lust for always more, indulgence in hunger
A greed for power, the demon needs to feed
From cradle you've been taught how to rule and conquer
The devil smiling, no isn't real
Black vultures in the mist approaching, now closer
The end is coming, we'll take it from there
A message goes to all the souls
To all those staying, face turned to the ground
You hold the key to infinite power
That has always been here and forever
Every time you step out, raise your voice

Resurrected from the ground
Designed for failure
Behold the waste is burnt to the ground
Face down and broken
We dedicated our essence to this game
No better time, let's dream on, wish for better
You're on an elevated sense of greater
These engines, power crushing down
One day we'll wake up from this absolute nonsense
A star worshiped will burn in the red
Disused and empty shell, icon of an old world
Conscience awakened, we'll take it from there",Planned Obsolescence
Gojira,"So god I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying
I don't know
the aberration of this world
I try to deal with
I've killed a part of me that was aching
The pain is gone
But denail runaway from institutions
I owe my self life

There's no way I will respond expression anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight fuck

But you wont attempt to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Gojira,"On the first light of the day you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star

Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

You are higher in the sky

Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild

When you get to the other side, please send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn

Everlasting love is ever-growing
Hang on to what you have and let it grow
Everlasting love is ever-dying
It's in the past, you have to let it go",The Shooting Star

God was in time for the children of Israel to cross the mighty Red Sea
He was on time when the walls of Jericho fell at Joshua's feet
Every time I feel discouraged, don't have to wonder where He'll be
God's been in time, on time, every time for me

Now there stood little David with a sling in his hand right before the giant so tall (so tall)
And it was unlikely then to all of those men, surely Goliath would fall
And when the three Hebrew boys wouldn't bow down to Baal, the king said they crossed the line

And they were thrown in the flame and then the fourth man came and God delivered right on time

I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas

Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44

Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you

For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die

So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un

Without hunting this Sprane Valleys deer

She wears softness as a gown
She spreads magic all around
Her feathers still untouched
She takes but nothing and she gives so much

She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings

She takes off when she desires
Silence grows on her lips
She can bring you so much higher
She spreads love on all her trips, yeah

She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings

Woke up this morning
And this feeling came to my head
To fly with her from sky to sky
'Cause my mind seemed to be dead
So I floated up towards her
On my mutilated wings
But all the blackness sings against me now
It's the lady of the strange wings
Yeah, it's the lady of the strange wings
Ooh, it's the lady of the strange wings
Ooh, it's the lady, it's the lady, lady of the strange wings

Ooh oh

From Vick Timm's last LP
Too much of a risk
For a golden disc

The price he paid for money

Sing your song, you can't go wrong
No need for alarm
Attempted his business adviser
You'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniper

One yawn, two yawn, and back to bed
Come on maman, bend down your head
Turn off the light and hold me tight

And just sing on, immortal song
A lecture on political chicanery
Fini belle vie, bonne nuit
Remember that song called ""Kill Me""
Of people's rape
Recorded on tape

Bought shame to the presidency
Tonight, tonight
One more point for human right

Remember that song ""Kill Me""
Once used by a man from Galilee
He had nothin' to lose
He was king of the Jews
Secured his place in history

He wasn't prepared for the shock
When howling lead
A new martyr for the book of rock
Bit into his head

Golden Earring,"Here's a sad, real sad record I've gotta dedicate
To a friend out there, somewhere on a big highway
That's quite a note you wrote
Before you sneaked out with that, what's his name?
Here's our song, yes the one
I used to play for you all day

You've gotta call and explain
Before you leave the station's range
I don't care who's listenin' in
Honey I'm against the wall
I'll adjust my program
To the kind of fool I am
I can only hope that you're tuned in

I have no choice, baby
I sell my voice, maybe
I'm just another lonesome D.J.

Alone, with a phone and a stack of black vinyl
And I know, that home could be just as futile
Without your presence
It wouldn't make any sense
So I beg, I never did
Never realized my love for you was that immense

Call and explain
Before you leave the station's range
I don't care who's listenin' in
Honey I'm against the wall
I'll adjust my program
To the kind of fool I am
I hope you're still tuned in

I have no choice, baby
I sell my voice, maybe
I'm just another lonesome D.J.

Rodeo, once you think you're riding high, off you go
Idol, ideal partner in dreams
Much too perfect to be true,
Here's another one for you

You say climbing in love is better than falling
Going ahead, is better than stalling,
Amplify me, satisfy me,
You unfold me, but you never told me
How far you've gone to strike upon such technique
You're bit of a rat, but you're still unique

I've been checking around, with the revolutionary

* The naked truth

Used to be a young gun
Out on the hard streets
Getting high on crystal
Drinking scotch and smoking weed
Daddy's wish used to be nothing less than my command
Took a switch to my back nailed me to a cross both hands
Mama couldn't give me
The thing a young boy needs
Instead of mama suffering
She was smart enough to leave
Spend my life fighting trying to stay free
From trials and tribulations and the state penitentiary
Hustled pool really looking cool
Just making both ends meet
Until that day I saw you walking
Down Blue Angel street
The sweetest lies are lily white coming from your lips
You brush away all my pain with a lazy finger tip hm
It moves my heart just watching
The way you walk so smooth
You save me from an evil fate
You steal away my blues
Lyin' here in your arms
I don't need more proof
Lyin' here safe and warm
It's just the naked truth
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
That's the naked truth
It's the naked truth
Going down that graveyard spiral
There was nothing I could do
Life treatin' me much harder
Than a mean old corkscrew
Lyin' here in your arms
I don't need more proof
Lyin' here safe and warm
It's just the naked truth
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you
This man loves you

* Lovesweat

You walk into the room - with your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked and you say: Who's that man
You try so hard but, you don't understand
Just what you'll say when you get home
Because somethin' is happenin' here
But you don't know what it is -
Do you - Mister Jones?
You raise your head - and you ask. Is this where it is?
And somebody points to you and says it's his
And somebody else says Well what is
And you say Oh my God - am I here all alone?
You hand in your ticket - And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you -
When he hears you speak - and says -
Now does it feel to be such a freak
And you say

Golden Earring,"From the Album:
* Lovesweat

Blue for the blue - I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground - feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes - take a look around
When the sun goes down - and the sun goes down
In the strangest way -
Red for the light - gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say - meant to say -
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier, to read the signs
Memorize the lines - you play with me
One for the road - I'll be on my way
Come another day - when the things we say
Find a way to be - way to be -
Solo:
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us - greens are brown
And disquise a sign -
Wintertime is a razorblade - that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from - where the children go -
It's a nursery rhyme - nursery rhyme

I got a top hat on
With my head in overload
I heard a radio song

There was something in the air

Watchin' everybody stare
You know I never tell
You knocked me to the floor
With a sound I never heard (2x)

I was walking down the street
Saw you sneakin' out your house

Saw you slip right through the door
You whispered just a word

There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
My baby call said I need you here
It's half past four and I'm shifting gears

When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need a phone at all
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio's playin' some forgotten song
Revelry's coming on strong
The road has got me hypnotized
As I spin into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends comfort coming in from above
Don't need no letters at all
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a line in the sky

No more speed I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool, now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
The line of cars drove down real slow
The radio plays that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's coming on strong
The news man sang his same song
One more radar lover gone

When I'm feeling lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends the comfort coming in from above

There’s only one that opens all doors for me

She was lookin’ at me all ready to please
Shining so pretty like a centerfold

Promisin’ me love unconditionally
Wherever I’d go she’d be with me
I had the blood, she had the gasoline
I had the blood, she had the gasoline

Yeah, we hit the road as if there’d ever been
Anything like this kinda free
She had the tunes on her radio
She taught me everything I needed to know

That car was beautiful, that car had soul
Whenever I wanted she was ready to roll
She’d never tire, felt like Jimmy Dean
On our way to infinity
All the way to infinity

Time keeps movin’, shatterin’, assumin’ that it won’t come back
Never come back
The memory of drivin’ like the sun of the moon
And a maniac in the future and the past

It was against his religion, but he took a shotgun along
He got himself a mess o' mighty fine quail and one old scraggly hare
And on the way home he crossed the path of a great big grizzly bear
Well the bear got down lookin' ready to charge
The preacher never seen nothin' quite that large
They looked each other right smack in the eye
Didn't take that preacher long to say bye

The preacher, he run till he spotted a tree
He said, ""Up in that tree's where I oughta be""

Scared to death, he turned about
He looked to the sky and began to shout

Yea, look out preacher!

Well, about that time the limb broke off
And the preacher came tumblin' down
Had a straight razor out of his pocket 
By the time he lit on the ground
He landed on his feet right in front a that bear
And Lord, what an awful fight 
The preacher and the bear and the razor and the hair
Flyin' from left to right

Well first they was up and then they was down
The preacher and the bear runnin' round an' round

He was havin' a tough time holdin' his own!

To the good book I'll abide
No more huntin' on the Sabbath day
Come Sunday I'm headin' to the church to pray""

Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,

Golden Rules,"I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine
Then I’ll never die
Beneath the darkened sky

Excuse my babble, I talk until I got lengthy
Certain topics get the best of my interest don't mean I'm friendly
Running like a leaky faucet
See we toss it to the side throw it in the closet
Very rare for me to lose my cool
We in a school full of stools
Sitting at a table dissecting these facts like they ain't true
Who told you you can get away with telling these lies?
Before you swallow oxygen look me in the eyes
Reflection in the mirror we don't recognize it
Paint a canvas in my image, put a frame around it
Don't even hang it 'cause I'm looking like, this supposed to be me?
Analyzing every logistic how can I fix it?
Changing everything but what I need help with, see now I'm trippin’
Now I'm fishing for a crack in the ceiling so I can ditch it
Rules golden like the mouth that I speak with to bite the tension
Count on me to let you down cause that's realistic. Rules

I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine
Then I’ll never die
Beneath the darkened sky

I started reading notes I wrote a couple months ago
Still the same dude, same angle, what you rushing for?
‘cause every second in the hour count a lot
Pencil for my test and had a lesson you forgot
Nobody owe you nothing, we tardy, show up with dozen
Should be on my shoulder weight, and like bussing tables or something
The fact you listen mean I’m doing well
Did I mention you could change the channel by yourself?
This a station, no commercial, gotta ping your spine to hurt you
Better late than never, follow me, gon’ miss your curfew
Plain open like a busy Monday
Days closin' like your favorite bakery and it ain’t making money
I’m kind of funny if you like to laugh
And people vent when they see me, I soak it up like bath
Never one to judge another when I have to use a mirror
? That you looking, they appear to be linear

I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine
Then I’ll never die
Beneath the darkened sky

They say the chief of the tribe took a handsome bribe
Now his face is everywhere but he's hard to find
Super prime, on the grind, in the modern times
Gains from the game in exchange for a sober mind
And young’un you can hug the block, but it won't hug back
Until it do, and it squeeze and your spine go snap
Like feet chasing paper then his lungs just collapse
Ain't no freedom at the trap, it’s as simple as that
Pay a hater no mind, because that don't matter
Why whip slaves when you can just kill master?
Slaves getting brave to guard masters’ interests
They too shall feel it once we snap the clip in
So no threats only oaths, get well or catch hell
Shop open get dosed, medina hours baby, we never close
And how ever the banks go this balance don't broke
Salaam folks

I got to feel the sunshine
I got to feel the thoughts of your mind on mine

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms

Golden Smog,"Met a man on a train near Santa Fe
Who was dead a minute as a child
Fell off a dock
He couldn't swim and his heart stopped
A gold snake slid from the sky
And swallowed him up
He disappeared inside
He disappeared inside

The train stopped in a field of oil wells
A blind girl needed help getting on
The man was drunk from a flask half full of rum
I shook my head
When he offered me some
Que sera, he said and took another swig
The train roared up a hill of sickly pines
A small boy chased a ball up the aisle
As the black mouth of a tunnel swallowed us up
We disappeared inside
We disappeared inside

Here we go",All the Same to Me
Golden Smog,"I am not a shadow
I am flesh and blood
Meet me in the middle
If you think you could
If you think you could

If I'm walking in the dark
I'm whispering
If I'm walking in the dark
I'm whispering
Follow my whisper
And I will see you through

If I make three wishes
One is not to fall
The other two will follow
Beyond the wall

If the world spins faster
On my knees I crawl
If the world spins faster
On my knees I crawl
On my knees I crawl
Straight on back to you

I've been lying in wait for you to come outside
I know you don't know me but I know a lot about you
You're the one who knows me better than I do

When I get back home
I'm gonna put your records on
I play 'em way too loud and I'll sing along
I know all the words to every song
And I don't really care
But tonight you sang one wrong

And I can't keep from talking
I can't keep from talking about you
And I just wanted to thank you
Thank you for doing what you do

I wanted to tell the world a little bit about myself
Realize my feelings and put them on a shelf
Then jump out the window so you'd all know what it's about

Wouldn't be here in this bar
Trying to get to you

Time takes toll, the hours I'd roll
Is it a blessing or is it a curse
Seems this love makes matters worse

I'm stuck in this cafe
Lost along the way
Moving to keep strong
When I'm feeling myself burn
It don't matter let it hurt
It tells me I'm alive

When you saw me in California
I was lost in a dusty haze
Now that I know you
You feel so far away

If I only had a car
Wouldn't be here in this bar
Trying to get to you

As I'm waving you goodbye
Following the line
Trying to get to you

Still the echos fill the void
Your eyes rolled in your head
As you slowly disappeared

Still hard to rearrange
The distance made it strange
I'm still trying to get to you

Wouldn't be here in this bar

Golden Smog,"She came from a wealthy family
There were walls inside the walls
She walked the widow's walk so all alone
She watched from every window
Darkened every door
Saw her reflection
In every wave that hit the shore

Jane, why don't you stay
Jane, why don't you give a damn
Jane, why don't you stay

Reading the silver side of signs

He took a Greyhound that was a bus
From the city of New Orleans

Was that of a simple screen
In a one Bal Harbour bedroom apartment

Deep in Nevada they played it straight
They stayed in Reno inside a casino

Cannon come to know we're on an endless flight
Won't come down again 'till All Souls Day

Spend your days, your time's unfazed
Passed out on a floor
Lost remains were claimed the names
Of something you ain't never felt before

I know a star that shines but not so bright
Its nights like these, they will fall out of the sky
She loves it all, just not herself tonight
Sleeps but never dreams and wonders why

The river bends, refuse descend
All washed up on the shore
The turnings seems like twisted scenes
Of something you ain't never felt before

You never felt before
You never felt before

The best made plans like planes are standing
Tumble through the hour glass
And all those things you've come to hate
Are gone

And hope won't bring her 'round again
She's yours until the bitter end
And all those things you've come to hate
Are gone

Why is it screaming what's unfair?
Please excuse it for getting out
Let the shellfish swell inside
How should I know? Watch it squirm
It's asking me words that I learned

Stay inside for me or space
Trip me in a sprinkling gray
Stay and take my fate

Thought I knew you, stuck out my hand
Didn't wish I could understand
It's a twisted feeling, its there and bold
It's time to burn out, hope I score
Wait for me there, dash and run
To watch this with the lantern

Take my fate, take my fate

on your button your punk rock button
You were born in S.I.T.
Vegetarian man no BLT on your muffin 
no turkey stuffing

Once and a while I'd surf with you
Our first band was called IMRU",Chris Cayton
Goldfinger,"My little story's
Growing way too long
I've had to suffer
Enough to write this song
And if I get the chance 
I'll tell you how it feels
Cause in this sick old head
The pain is way to real
So I fall down
I don't know 
If I can make it up this time

I know I want to but it gets
Harder every time 
And if it's easier
To give up everything 
I'd give it all to you
To relieve half this pain

Cause it's been hard
Yeah it's been hard 

I sit there at the bar
I wonder what I've done
Should I just fuck it all

Or should I
Go back home
Cause if I take that drink
I might as well just die
And if I kill myself
I'd be giving up my try",Disorder
Goldfinger,"I run away cause I'm 
Scared that you might leave
There's nothing wrong
But that's not what I believe
Just tell me it's alright
And tell me I'm okay
And tell me that you're 
Staying here tonight

I feel stupid saying
Words you've heard before
The way I feel today
Is all I know for sure
And if I scare you
I'm only scaring me
I've got so much to say
Why won't you speak with me
I need to know 

What you're feeling
Do you feel like I do
Let's talk about everything
I want to share my life with you
And tell me that you feel
The way I feel with you
And tell me that 
You love me like I do

You're in my life
Well I want to be sure
I'm not wasting time
I've been through this before",I Need to Know
Goldfinger,"If only I was taller
If I had a million dollars
Maybe then you'd be with me

If only I was eighteen
And had the courage 
Of the A-Team
Maybe then you'd be with me

But for now I'll have to dream
About your smile 'cause you're not
Here and all I want to say is
That I really miss you

If I could surf a little better
If I had Sumner's sweater
Maybe then you'd be with me

If only I had more time
If I had Mike Ness' hairline
Then you'd want to be with me

If only you weren't so fine
If only I wasn't so blind
I'd find a way
To make you stay 
Then maybe I'd see you 

If I woke up 
With all these things
Would it even change your feelings
None of that is even me 
But for now I'll have to 
Wait another week
To see your face and all I want to say is 
That I really miss you",If Only
Goldfinger,"Living life and freedom
Wondering if my love 
Could be as one
And if that you could 
Possibly love me
Thinking life 
And living life
Are two very different things
The first one being harder 
Than the last

Tonight's the last time 
That I ever show you me

Thinking all these days are gone
And dreaming of my time with you
Just makes me wish 
That I was with you now

Driving the ninety 
I'm thinking of you
If I could turn back time
I'd look you in the eye
Then I might see your lies",The Last Time
Goldfinger,"Where are you now
I want to talk to you
I'm sitting here alone
Waiting by the phone

Where are you now
I want to talk to you
If only you were home
I wouldn't be alone
I wait for you

Where are you now
Are you just toying with me
Do you need me to play 
All your high school games

Where are you now
I guess I'll try once more
I don't have much to say
But it's the tenth call that I made
And it's ringing in my head 
Yeah the last thing that 
You said now

I ask you just
What is it you've tasted
Your answer's hushed
I'm wasted, so wasted
And all the promises you made
Were the others just the same now",My Head
Goldfinger,"You got some question about your life
You don't know how you'll ever make it through
It hurts so bad but it's all you got
You're asking me for help
But all I got to say now is that
You don't know what pain is
You haven't suffered one iota 
So just stop your whining
You don't know what pain is

Stop complaining point your finger
I'll tell you who to blame

So pack your bags 
We're going out
I want to show you 
Just what's in this world
Cause in the end its all you got
Memories to tell about your life
And how you lived it

So live it good
I know it's all that you've given

You don't know what pain is
You haven't suffered one iota

You don't know what pain is
Stop complaining

I'll tell you who to blame",Question
Goldfinger,"You come around
To see your boyfriend
You come around 
To feel the pain
It was yesterday he tried to use you
But you still go through it

Again you took it away
Again you let yourself stay

I've been around
This lonely place
Lonely place before

You find out 
He's been lying to you
You find he had another girl
Still you never 
Stand up for yourself
You never stand up to him

He takes it away
Again you let yourself stay
Again you gave it to him
You said it's the last time 
He does it again

Goldfinger,"The young boy has 
Turned into a man
And he's growing stronger
He's battled through things
He thought he could
Go on no longer
Father stood by his side
Wanting nothing more 
Than just be his dad
But pride only answers 
To one call
He only condemns him

And if the boy only knew
The father's pain
The nights that he
Stayed up late
Wondered why
Doesn't he see the future
Is so bleak so bleak

Father's retired now
He's left with tv and rest
The weight of the world
And what did he do wrong 
Has gone to his chest
He had such a good life 
The family he loved
Were all by his side
To his son he whispered
Goddamn this pride

So fuck I'm all by myself
Now you've gone away
You've left me 
All by myself
With that fucked up
Thing you said
If I could forgive myself
You knew the way
Now I'm all by myself
And I'm sorry

But if you only knew
Your son's pain
How bad that he wanted 
You to say
You're doing just fine

From my window I'm staring while my coffee grows cold
Look over there! Where?
There's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something
So I am told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here, round here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there! Where? 
Here comes Amy with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
And so there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here, around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's more down as dead
Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around this scene

How you do that trick
""The one that makes me scream,"" she said
""The one that makes me laugh,"" she said
And threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face, I kissed her neck
And dreamed of all the different ways 
I had to make her glow
""Why are you so far away,"" she said
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
Just like a dream

Daylight whipped me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I open up my eyes
I find myself alone, alone, alone
Above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me.

You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven",Just Like Heaven

That's fine, I know them all pretty well.

Sometimes I feel I gotta get away.

But I know if I don't I'll go out of my mind.
So I leave her behind where the kids are alright,

I know if I'd go things'd be a lot better for her.

Is it me, the man with the stranger's face?
Must I be the man in a suitcase?

The world's my oyster; a hotel room's a prison cell

Buy a bag of balloons with the money weÂ´ve got
Set them free at the break of dawn

Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, its red alert
ThereÂ´s something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
And focusing it on the sky
The ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine decisions treat
Ninety nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine knights of the air
Ride super high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a super hero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scrambling the summer sky
Ninety nine red balloons go by

As ninety nine red balloons go by

Ninety nine dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standing pretty
In this dust that was a city

You and I in a little toy shop
buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, ""Something's out there""
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by.

99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
Where 99 red balloons go by.

99 Decision Street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by.

99 Knights of the air
ride super-high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a Silver hero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
As 99 red balloons go by.

As 99 red balloons go by.

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go.",99 Red Balloons [DVD]
Goldfinger,"Its been weeks since I felt good
its time to get out of bed
Not feeling like I should
Sometimes I feel dead
I see my life wasted all away

Sometimes I feel like a failure
Or am I just fed up
Sometimes it just seems useless
Or am I that fucked up
I feel hopeless
I shut down

Wonder where the time has gone
What day is it this week
I wish that I could stop my head
The future, it looks bleak
I see my life, but that was yesterday

Sometimes I feel like a failure
Or am I just fed up
Sometimes it just seems useless
Or am I that fucked up
I feel hopeless
I shut down

Sometimes I feel like a failure

Goldfinger,"The start of Armageddon
It was just another day
We all saw the news, nothing to say

So many friends are missing
And family members gone
So we all pray that God help them be strong

And now we stand together
Remembering that day
The lives we live will never be the same

[CHORUS]
And we don't know why
The innocent die
Will this world ever find a way to change?
And we don't know why
But we know it's not right
We don't know why so many had to die
We don't know why so many had to die

Hate has turned to others
For their religion or their skin
But hate can't solve the problem it began
Everyone is angry
People are afraid
And no one knows what decisions will be made

Goldfinger,"I met her Sunday, that was yesterday
The girl I knew from 1990
Her eyes are hazel, her name is Mable
I kissed her once and now I'm able to

Walk a mile, crack a smile
She makes me want to kiss all the

Babies, hug the puppy dogs
She makes me feel like a mom
Smell the flowers and plant a tree
I gotta say that Mable
She's the bomb

Now it's Monday, better than Sunday
Mable told me that she would stay
Her curly hair shines in her eyes
Boy that Mable sure is fine

I'm with her now until I die
She makes me want to kiss all the

Babies, hug the puppy dogs
She makes me feel like a mom
Smell the flowers and plant a tree
I gotta say that Mable
She's the bomb

Then on Tuesday, Mable left me
I heard she's goin' out with Charlie
She saw his package from what I know she said:
""That looks like a tube of cookie dough!""

Mine, she said then, looks like a small 
pencil with broken lead

Rabies got the puppy dogs
and now I really need my mom
I bought her flowers, so woe'st me
It sucks I still think Mable 
She's the bomb

She had all she could want
But her unhappiness
Preceded what she bought
She said, everyone around here
Is wasting my time

She wants everyone to sit around
And talk about her life
Dont ask her how she feels

I know it hurts
Dont tell me cause you know
Its gotten worse
Dont tell me cause you think

To complain about the world
She says how shes much better than you
Shes a special girl

Of that northern California house
A safety pin in my ear on Cayton's bike
Playing Bad Brains fucking loud
Smoking weed on the streets in the California heat
Spray paint on the walls
Stealing booze, cracked a tooth, we had nothing else to lose
Getting wasted to Twist and Crawl

Someday you'll see everything I've left behind

Skies are gray, will I be okay?
Watch the memories I made turn to dust

When the glitters gone

Some people just wanna play

Watching boats and planes
Pretty white clouds

But it always broke your heart 
You know those paper rings, girl, always fall apart
They say that nothing lasts too long 
But I know something that's gonna stay forever strong... 

Our love is timeless like a summer day 
Forever soulful like Marvin Gaye 
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you, baby, timelessly 

Ooh baby... ooh... 
Watching the world go by
Changing everyday 
They tear down a thing of beauty
To build some new highway
What's here today may disappear 
But baby, our love surely will survive the years 
Because it's timeless like a summer day 
And everlasting as a Shakespeare play 
Baby, timeless as a melody 
I love you baby, timelessly 

Ooh...
Where there is love
There is endless hope and boundless dreams 
When you got love 
There's no limits to be seen
Girl, you know what I mean 

They say that nothing lasts too long 
But I know something that's gonna stay forever strong...

Goldie,"Don't erase what I did, don't erease the beginning!

You're not ready for this. 
Uh-huh. You see, my name is KRS-One G
And um, see, when I be coming through, for the U.K.-crew
Me and Goldie sssh, you know how we do
Only the true hip-hop-heads know what time it is with this
Now, if you're with me.

Ill lead through and dominate this microphone I speak through
I'm writing for the people, bite it if you need to
I can see through and see that, you saw an MC and tried to be that
That MC you saw was me can you believe that? And obey that?

True lyrics will always subvice and meaning rhymes equal actual life
Its the true essence in ebony, trace your record-sales G
Somethings are pure luck, other things are meant to be
I bet they'll mention me, in the next century:

KRS-One, innovator in early rap-poetry
Simultaneously you will be forgotten
While in the year 2000 Criminal Minded will still be rocking
You waste your time battling me I got mine happening, see?

You should have thought G, a little bit sooner
Instead of battling me you need your plan your long heavity
Before you die broke like Sammy Davis junior
The solar, followed by the looter, followed by the solar

Followed by McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The point is whatever the outcome of the battle
The day goes on with more french fries and soda
One, two and you don't quit, Goldie has got to be the real sure shit
One, two and you don't quit, KRS-One and yes we do it like this

Buckle up your seatbelt we about to get busy
Lyrics get thrown like a frisbee, who is he?
The K, you gets dizzy all for the roots like Kizzy
And Kunta-Kinte in your city

Ask for Sensei not million more like teacher
Now you're familiar let me fill ya
Its like a jungle sometimes, it makes me rhyme
As were climbing up the speed, were finding what we need in the jungle

MC's stumble over their words and mumble over their verbs
Suddenly it occured: KRS-One, word!

KRS-One, come back in digital, digital, digital, digital -2x
I gotta get buckwild, I gotta get buckwild
I gotta get buckwild, coming through with that freestyle -2x

You can run with this, on the junglelist
Only KRS-One can do it like this
Forever, and ever a decade embedder
Whatever, how ever, rough to the leather

Let me shedder flame as I go offstage and blow up game
In the jungle I spot the L. like U.N.C.L.E. when I cast don't fumble
Kris and Goldie drum n bass only no one can hold me
U.K. drum n bass all in your face

Got to represent U.K. up in this place
Representing like the internet
All the way from New York City down to your motherfucking set
KRS-One, you know how we do, son

Coming through on that break dance, one (one)
Two (two), three (three), you know how we be
Break dancing back in nineteen-eighty-three
Take the mill with a savoir-faire, man, when you stop and stare

The style is rare, no, you can't compare keep your eye right here
You can buy that there, or buy this right here
But guaranteed this will have your mind like Yeah!
Stumble, fumble, crumble Kris kicks these lyrics in the jungle

Making all these rappers mumble
Bass n drum to this all under this I got a bundle of this
For the jungle lists, jump to this
Kris from that Bronx, New York

You best a-walk or get bucked like a pork
Rewind, stop whining I'm rhyming, timing is binding
But you're still finding, you'll wait through what I say the number one DJ
On the microphone minds get blown

KRS-One again? Yes this shits sown
Like a microphone that's chrome all alone in your home
Definitely straight to your dome

KRS-One, come back in digital, digital, digital, digital

KRS-One

Ah, check it out now, check it out now, check it out now
As we take you back to nineteen-seventy-nine
KRS-One going back in time

Sellin' sexy DVD's of a Willy being kissed
Stealin' pensions on the old and infirm

Made a fortune sellin' doctors fake sperm

Don't ever trust me, always doin' a scam

I even sliced my penis up and sold it as ham

He pinched them from ladies and upset the gentry

He's the modern day menace of the nineteenth century

A gentleman thief, a scholar and a rogue
Doing the locomotion like Kylie Minogue
He's got the strength of ten like a maniac

Here he comes, he's a money grabbin' bastard from Newport

A design for a way of livin' so revolutionary, so groundbreaking,
That its very concept posed a threat to the fabric of society.

In the middle of a Glyn Williams' coach full of nuns.

Goldie Lookin Chain,"Hey, the first time that I met my mate
Was in the roller rink where I went to skate
It was early in the decade around '83
Back then Maskell's was the place to be

Pay two quid for your entry fee
I glide into the arena, ecstasy
When you were seven you didn't realize
Most of the adults were stoned out of their eyes

Some jacked up on the seats around the edge
Others were so fucked that they turned into veg
I didn't care 'cause I made my pledge
Rollskating at Maskell's got respect

I used to listen to Public Enemy
Erik be and Rakim and BVSMP
But before that in 1983
I'd go break dancing after my tea

Down the Youth Club, eating the fruit pastels
Saturday morning I'd go down to Maskell's
It was my favorite place to go
Dancing all day at the Roller Disco

N-n-nineteen eighty three

When Maskells is over it's out on your bike
Doing bunny hops and wheelies if you like
Nicking from the shop and comparing your Nike
Dropping bricks onto trains was a delight

Then I'd find a weak kid and have a fight
Use your pocket money to buy a head band for the night
From Fussels, Newport's health-sports store
This is the stuff I used to do before

Draw Paul Hardcastle, n-n-nineteen
Was always played on the roller disco scene
I would listen to the music 'til I went deaf
Skating around backwards to Axel F

Even back then I was still wearing gold
They had an ice rink upstairs so I was told
It was ecstasy going round a pillar
Doing a special dance to Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'

why-why-you fukin' knows it
N-n-nineteen eighty three
How was the year son?
N-n-nineteen eighty three

Oh, eating cola cubes and watching Grange Hill
Riding my chopper to the Chip shop in Pill
I didn't know words like Cunny or Vag
Getting my two hundred meters swimming badge

Back then you were seven, I was eight
I only just started to masturbate
When I was in school the days went slow
'cause I was dreaming of a fuckin' roller disco
F-f-fucking alright
S-s-say first fuck

I didn't smoke, I didn't drink booze
I collected 'Star Wars' stickers and bubble gum tattoos
Stuck 'em on my face 'cause it made me feel hard
Then popped into the shop to buy some football cards

Finished the album, Panini '83
Get back home in time for the A-Team and tea
Then watch Bullseye and Saint and Greavsie
Go to bed, 'til tomorrow, see?

I watch the A-Team and Airwolf too
Before I found drugs and started sniffing glue
Riding round the lane on my Grifter or my Chopper
Even back then I was a hip hopper

No, no do it right, like augh ugh!
I'm gonna do a Jimi Hendrix,
Eugh, I'm gonna be sick in my sleep, eugh, augh ugh!

I tries to do it proper but kept comin' up a cropper
I needs some hype I think I'll ram raid happy shopper
Haven't got a car so I use a space hopper
Bouncing to the window, cut my head, show stopper
I want a hundred fans, 200 teeny boppers
I want police protection from 87 coppers
I wanna go gold even better platinum
If you wanna be a star you gotta kill yourself, man
It's the truth step back, take a look around
Elvis is dead for being fat, 500 pound
Kurt Cobain's rich as fuck he's buried in the ground
Jimi Hendrix and his amp still ain't makin' no sound
Michael hutchence, he's one of 'em too
Made a hundred million quid dying tossing on the loo

S U I C I D E 
It might be messy but it's money for free

Suicide is painless or so it has been said
I could've killed myself but I'd be better off dead
So I took a deep breath, put a gun against my head
Pulled the trigger, click, should've been eating lead
But I wasn't, I was naked in john frost square
Mothers with pushchairs stopped and stared
For this situation I was quite unprepared
Tried suicide to be famous but nobody cared

Committing suicide to enhance my career
It worked for mickey and Tupac Shakir
Jesus was nailed up to some wood
2000 years later and book sales are still good
I heard in a song suicide is painless
And it's 80% sure to make you famous
W4nking with a bag on yer head tied to a door
That bloke from I-N-X-S he knew the score

S U I C I D E, it might be messy but it's money for free
S U I C I D E, it might be messy but it's money for free

I gotta kill myself, I gotta do's it quick
John entwistle sly, he was snorting arsenic
I keep taking all this coke to make me die
Doin' more drugs than they make in fuckin' I-C-I
It's the best way to go, don't think me dull
I'm not gonna fall off the roof like the flid rod hull
We want people to sing all our songs
And the nuns at saint Joseph's rappin' on smokin' bongs
We wanna be remembered when we're six feet under
For hip-hoppin' not robins fuckin' beatings or plunder
At the moment I'm not dead like David kampasey
Double platinum means you gotta be pushin' up daisies
Dad's army's all dead, every last one
But the cents are still going on BBC1
Yeah that's right I smoke draw from wales
Suicide's a good idea to improve vinyl sales

It's useless, it's crap, I'll never be in the sun
How can I be a pop star when I can't buy a gun?
Jimmy Morrison overdosed in the bath
I know, I'll hang myself with my scarf
Tied to the stairs, dangling by my neck
The cord length I forgot to check
Stuck it for a week, unable to shriek
The landlord found me and he called me a freak
He cut me down and started to laugh
'if you're dead next week gimme your autograph'
You know I thanked him, returned to my room
The new plan is to go out with a boom
To the station, with a petrol can
Five pound please, I say to the man
All set up and ready to burn
The wheel on my lighter just won't turn

Suicide is a suicyclebbbl
Suicide is a suicyclebbbl
Suicide is a suicyclebbbl, I wanna be famous after I die

Proven fact, man, if you're dead you sell more
That drummer from def leopard, his arm has made 30 times more than he has
You know our elvis? well, he's dead famous now and he's dead and he's fa
He's more famous now like
He's dead like you know, that's what it's all about like
It's fuckin' simple economics
They reckon bob marley's dead but he's not, man, 
Cause he was on the TV last night, man
Just don't lie to me, man
I thought I was havin' a go at an overdose, 
But I I I don't think you can overdose on beechams flu plus
I think one of the blokes off of dads army is still alive, 
I think he's bumming martin in eastenders innit?
I'll get the ropes, and we'll tie them to the walls, 
And we all jump off at the same time and break our necks 
And we'll make at least 13 quid and you
Knows we'll be famous like fuckin' Gandhi

Goldie Lookin Chain,"Burned a new hole in my tracksuit today,
Smoking Soap Bar without an ashtray,
Red-hot nylon dripping on my skin,
I ripped the fucker off, and threw it in the bin,
Soap Bar?s cheap, and so?s my clothes,
they've got to be cause of all the fucking holes,
It tastes like shit and it makes you cough,
And it?s the fucking rubber in it that gets you off.

Yeah, I smoke Soap Bar with lots of bits of plastic,
I leaves mine in it cause it tastes fantastic,
Skunk costs too much, I can't see the appeal,
Of smoking Port Rocky, Soap Bar or Gold Seal,
Smoke Rocky in a bong, bucket or hot-knives,
Bake it in a cake for your Mam as a surprise,
I smokes Green, and it?s gone in an instant,
But Soap Bar lasts, cause it?s fucking consistent.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Last night I went out driving in my car,
I sparked up a fat spliff of fucking Soap Bar,
A Blim-burn burned right down to my dick,
And while I was distracted, I fucking crashed into a 
Brick wall, the car was fucking battered,
The bonnet flipped up and the windscreen shattered,
you're better off smoking The Green instead,
Cause it don't Blim-Burn and it?s better for your head.

Soap Bar! Sitting in a deep sweat,
Thinking! I've got to get some Rocky for the,
Weekend! The sight of Draw excites me,
Stick it in a bong, light it up and chug a fucking,
Whitey! Burning holes in my tracky,
This shit always happens when I'm smoking fucking Rocky,
you've heard it on the news; you've seen it on the telly,
Add up for moving Soap Bar down fucking Liz Werry
?I do it like a little cause light the fucking thing as always?
I used to smoke Skunky but it was far too smelly, man! 

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Most Soap Bar comes from fucking Holland,
They make it out of oil, and tires and pollen,
Diesel, Miramar, Flat-Press too;
These are types of Soap Bar available to you,
These little bits of plastic you find inside;
You can use those as a quality guide,
Of the standard of Soap Bar that you are smoking,
The more bits of plastic means the better the toking.

Eat a Hash-cake but wait a while, 
it'll take about an hour ain't Draw versatile,
You can burn it, eat it, or smoke it in a spliff,
Space shakes, Draw gateau?s, you knows it Delia Smith,
Lying in your bed dropping blimps on your pubes,
Selling Draw to your mates but it?s really Oxo cubes,
When you're cooking up draw, be quick don't lick it,
Cause it?s really fucking hot and it'll burn your fingers.

This bloke said to me; ?You haven't got a clue,
About the damage that Soap Bar can do to you?,
I tried to see things from his point of view,
But I couldn't fit my head up his asshole too,
The bloke was wrong, I knows my stuff,
I knows if I smoke it, I'm gonna feel rough,
My lungs are fucked and my throat is raw,
Cause the thing about Soap Bar; it?s fucking hardcore.

Smoking on up, Soap Bar in the sky,
I?ll smoke Soap Bar ?till I fucking die,
Before I die and they lay me to rest,
I will always smoke Soap Bar, that's the best.

Well anyway I think it?s better myself to lean forwards,
When smoking Soap Bar, because you are less likely to Blim-Burn,
You know what I mean?

Innit, check it out man! I got some quality fucking Gold-Seal for you, innit?
Shape up all those little bits of plastic what you find inside, right,
And then fucking stick them in a teapot,
Makes a lovely cup of tea, that does.

What I do, stick a fag in the microwave, right,
You toke it up, you sticks the Draw on top,
And you rams it in a bong and you rams the bong in your fucking head.

Yeah that's like my fucking lungs feel like, 
they're fucking collapsing sometimes from the Soap Bar like,
You know?",Soap Bar

You know that, time passes and I'm lovin' every second
Buyin' chips for you is as lovely as I reckoned
You're Victoria Spice, I'm David Beckham
If you were Dellboy, I'd be the streets of Peckham
Why don't you come to me? Why can't you see?
My love for you is like Matt Bolan to a tree

Dance with me
You and me, baby
You and me, baby
Tonight

I'll take you for a ride, we won't go far
You've been runnin' through my mind like a shinin' star
We've got plenty of time to make sweet love
""'cause tonight's the night we take off the glove

Don't worry, I'll sort out the bill
Supported by the D-H-S-S

You can smokes my fags and drinks my beer

Goldie Lookin Chain,"That's right, you knows what I'm saying
Your mother's offered me the goods, I'm not paying.
It started as a laugh, as a bit of a joke
Something funny to say when I was having a smoke.

I first heard off this bloke, this fucking rumour going round
Your mother's reputation it's not sound
She's saving up the pennies hoping they'd turn into pounds
To have an operation to swap her gender around.

It's a shock to me and it's a shock to you
Your mother's got a beard, sandals and a penis too
It don't look right see, when she's walking down the street
To see her ball bag jiggin' to the beat of her feet

I said
Your mother's got a penis
Your mother's got a penis

That's right
Your mother's got a penis

In internet rooms and computer mainframes
There's loads of females but your mother's blue veins.
Not the ones in her legs or the backs of her arms
But the ones in her member head and in her garms.

She walks around proud, with a short dress on
Which sometimes exposes the tip of her dong.
Often it's dripping, sometimes it's dry
No matter when I see her there's a tear in my eye.

I thought I had to tell you, had to put it in a letter
But I thought fuck that I'd write a song in much better.
The only way to do it, to really let you know
I could prove it because I gave it a blow.

It was purely accidentally because she got me really drunk
And she made me kiss her elephant trunk.
You know why? That's right
Your mother got a penis.

Your mother's got a penis (Your mother's got a penis)

When she walks down the street, then she walks like John Wayne
I just seen her pissing standing up again.
Don't make no sense when you see her here and there
She got a cock and balls and real pubic hair.

And a single eye that sometimes weeps
If she lying on the bed then she rubs it on the sheets
Or up against the door or the back of your neck
If your mother's around then you make a double check.

I hate to tell you with all due respect
Take your mother to the doctors because her front bum's wrecked.

You know why?

And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl

Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence

And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm strugglin and strivin, hustlin and divin, and duckin from the five-o's
And from them marks right down the way we call our rivals
Young soldiers ten deep on the grind spot
We got the trumps and dimes hot and here's where the line stops
And I can't keep my nine in the bushes, Spice
Cause them jealous niggas and them dopefiends and the fuckin vice
Want a nigga to close shop because I'm tearin a grip
I got they spot shook down, let's empty the round, down the clip
They try to ride, must thought we leave, nigga, but never that
They send some dopefiends over to kill us, nigga, but never that
Straight punks call the task
They can't work the helicopters, k9's and gats on that ass
Niggas hit the fences droppin all they twamps, intentions fail
Tryin to make it to my hooptie, but my homie scooped me
Hittin fences, one of my boys got snagged
We tried to get him loose, but the k9's came and chewed his ass
My other boy's on the roof jumpin house to house, he lost a step
And fell to the ground and broke his fuckin neck
They're killin my crew off, they're killin my crew off
We gotta split up or these k9's and helicopers gonna get us
So I bail, never look back, I think I lost him 
Killed his k9 dog, I cut him up and then I tossed him
My other boys said fuck it, they stopped and had a showdown
Before they got took the task counted four down
My other bro was hurt, he hit his knees and threw his hands up
They put two zips of coke in his pockets, then they put him in handcuffs
I was almost through the share and breathin heavy
If I made it when I got behind the wheels I knew they couldn't fade it
I done told you bout them do's and can't's and that shift kick
I hit them corners and five-o got ditched quick
Them niggas ratted us out, the five-o banged coke and gatted us out
Now I'ma show you fools what bein mad is about

[ CHORUS 1 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust

[ VERSE 2 ]
I started with ten niggas, I'm down to the dome
I got no block to call my spot, I got no hood to call my home
I must stay strong and maintain D.T.A.
My real homies are gone, so now that gotta be the way
I started in the streets like a hobo, now I'm mobile
I organize my business, but I still duck the robo
I make mo' money, breakin ounces down sellin sacks, fuck them savages
Kickin my dough down, lookin for packages
I had to down my Chavelle and come anew
Cause I was hot from the block when I used to run the crew
In Oakland on the East Side you know how we ride
We like to swing and slide, whip them old schools and make them inches tight
So I flip the 50 with deposit tractions
Sitton on chrome, Toni supercharge ?Braxton?
You hear me then you wonder where I am
The Flowmaster dude's barkin hard with the hitters and them camps
First 50 in the Town with the racing stripes
Smokin it up like them dopefiends basin pipes
Niggas know I got the sack
They got a drop but I don't, but they know the trigger got my back
I see they mouths droolin, niggas gettin shifty-eyed
They want to jack me cause they know that my 50 ride
One fool tried to jack me on the late tip
Aimed for this chest but I caught him in the hip
Keep one in the chamber with the meter on my dick
Since the safety's on the trigger you'se one dead nigga

[ CHORUS 2 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they'll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I got them zippers and them quarters and them eights
My stack is gettin fat, so I'm lockin it up in safes
I got the combination tatooed on my brain
Hear all them busters sayin, ""That dude's rollin caine""
Whenever the niggas are rollin the dank and the stank I'm makin the bank
I set up a shop on the block cause drivin and servin the fools I can't
I told you in the first verse my first shop got shut down
100 grand strong from the dank, I gives a fuck now
A daily operation, more than 40 grand a week
And if they raise the profit, the Goldy man'll speak
The rollers give a fuck about the niggas grindin dime sacks
They always slap em up and scare em just to find where I'm at
Shit, there was a time when I was a soldier on the block myself
Now I'm stressin and I'm knowin now that I got my wealth
Now I'm the man with the team that's worked with under me
But I don't trust none of them fools as far as I can see
I know I should cut em loose
Cause if they get caught and have to do 5 they turn me in and settle for 2
Plus they're bringin me five g's a day
I can't let em go, I'm stuck, so I gota hit my knees and pray
Cause I'ma go out like I came in, a soldier
And if I get corner shopped, you all be sayin I told ya
And what I made is mine
Fuck you hoes tryin to find where my safe is at
You all get your face a smack
I don't trust anybody
I be one locked up or dead nigga with a hidden safe full of money

[ CHORUS 1 & 2 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they'll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

Yeah, muthafucka
Watch your backsides and your frontsides
Don't trust any muthafuckin body
You can't trust the white man
You can't trust that janky bitch you're with

	Really though

[ VERSE 1: Goldy ]
The game is sold, not told, stop holdin your hand out and wantin a freebee
I'm from Oakland, you can never be me, so stop ridin my dick and makin it greasy
Easy to take what's Oakland's, you klepto, you stepped though
When we asked your ass who started that 'bitch' word sayin from the get-go
(Biaatch) In 1982 I heard it from Too $hort
Moms and pops said, ""Turn it off"", but you stuck and said, ""Fuck rap from New York""
Cause your dick got hard, but you ain't seen a pussy or been in one
Listen to $hort, be ready to mack some bitches when it's done
It's some of that mackish Oakland street shit, 'bitch' wasn't no secret
But it got famous when we said it when that beat hit
When $hort dropped, niggas rappin now was infants
We taught you the pimp-player-mack game cause you didn't know the difference
You took the game and twist it, bent it out of shape
Payin a bitch, givin her free dick, savin, just without a cape
Mark, afraid they call your woman a bitch and put that bitch in her place
Keepin her payin you cash and put your dick in her face
Brims, perms, Caddy's with the 5th wheel
We told you some of the game you ran, wouldn't, couldn't sit still
So now it's time to take back what you stole, and make you fold
Bitch, because the game is sold, not told

So let the game out-slick and hit a high note
And then scream out 'bitch!' and let em all know you love Too $hort, biatch
Now everybody want to pimp, mack hats on a simp, niggas frontin on a pimp
I'm from Oakland, California where _The Mack_ was made
Grab a pen, start pimpin, like that, you're paid
But your game is shallow, not pimpin, you a car thief
Worse than a fake gangster rap to a hard beat
I tell it like it is, not sittin at the house thinkin music biz
I got love for the pimp game, niggas stop dissin
Daddy's in the house, and when you hear, pops listen
Next time you start mackin in a studio session
I got to charge his punk ass for lessons
Cause he want to be $hort Dog so damn bad, why'all
Bitin on my dick tryin to show that ass off
Workin that image just like me
But the game is sold, it don't come for free
And I won't say ""please"" when I collect my fees
Bow down, little nigga, drop to your knees
And recognize the original pimps on the mic
Too $hort, Blowfly and Dolemite

All about that real Oakland mack shit, busters, not no phoney
Dressin up like the old days, the player's ball ain't Halloween
We give one in Oakland every year, stay home and keep your collar clean
Cause you're not like a player, more like a shade-tree, better yet a rest haven
Tuck your dick in your ass and watch your chest cave in
Where I'm from niggas be mackin hoes for bread and water
Mackin they wife, cause stackin is life and times is gettin harder
All of a sudden you don't know
That $hort said never love a bitch or a hoe?
Mark, so recognize that you learned it from the legendary Too $hort
You stole that image and stole that game, we claim that shit that you wrote
The slow beat, fat bass, and funky bassline
With a name like Mike Dog get bit from $hort Dog, I know it taste fine
Like givin a fool a ounce of coke, keepin his ass from goin broke
When he get rich don't give you shit, you saw him, but he never spoke
What? What part of the game is that?
We gave you the sack and gave you the game to run it
Without this Oakland game you wouldn'ta done it
You midget rat bastard, you should be blasted for the dicks you rode
To get the game, cause it's sold, not told

Wear that hat like me, nigga, act like me
But I bet that muthafucka won't get fat like me
Cause it's more than a pimpin-ass image and a style
I been doin this for years, gettin bitches all the while
A real player gotta know how to lay his shit
Fake players get a bitch and don't be sayin shit
You a player? You get teased sometimes
I'm a pimpin-ass nigga makin g's for lines
Some call it gangster rap, even though it ain't
Won't nobody get shot while I spit this game
So call the pimp police, and just hold it
I put the game to the beat, and niggas stole it
Now some want to-be from Oakland pimp
Knocked two bitches, ain't broke em in
You ask me, that shit is foul
You want some money? Can't get it now
You gotta change your style, you can't pimp no more
My old tapes still sit in the record store
Sellin more than yo new shit do
You said you had bitches, nigga, who pimped who?
Cause you're workin in a warehouse now
Bout to blow your brains out tryin to wear my style out
You shoulda picked some other songs to rap
Cause Oakland, California is the home of _The Mack_
And it's sold not told, nigga
The game

The muthafuckin game",The Game Is Sold Not Told
Goldy,"She's a price-tag prostitute, so I got to shoot
And if my game is right, man, then I can knock her boots
Because to me a girlfriend is of past tense
They fucked me good, but broke me for my last cents
I was a lemon treatin' tramps like women
Never understood the reason why I couldn't go in em
Now a hoe will think twice before she choose on me

'Cause all I offer is my dick and my are-a-p
But you new boys are sipin', and
Thinkin' that you're pimpin', and
Wouldn't have a rat if you were starvin' and limpin', man
All you're doin' is crossin' a real player's game
So you sling caine to get a name
Know all the Lincolns and the Grants and the Jacksons
Bitches at your door, a rich dude givin' you action

So you kick em down one, two, three, four hundred
And when I saw you with the broad, boy, you sho' fronted
Loud talker like a father figure
But any punk can play her father if his pocket's bigger
And you hoes get treated like a child again
You don't work or go to school 
And get beat when you act a fool
Go home to da 255 pounds for you gladly 

You know you hate the sight of him
Damn, but you'se a tramp and if it pays you good, you might love him
Don't you have any self-respect?
Is the dollar that mighty that you trade him sex?
Now tell me, what does that price include?
Will you suck me and fuck me and dance in the nude?

Well, now you got me trippin', baby
I could buy your freak, toss her up, and call her my lady?
Well, that sounds pretty damn reasonable
I'll just pay her, if that's all that's pleasin' the hoe
What does that sound like to you?
Well, for the right price, player, you got yourself a prostitute

I once had a bitch named Anne-Marie
Fucked her sister and her mother down her family tree
She was just another prospect, a player had to test her
Flashed my money, played dumb like Uncle Fester
Make her think that I'm her sugar daddy
She can lick me, cause I'm full of candy
Man, I got her bitin', she thinks she found herself a sucker

But I'm a pricier, let's see how much it is to fuck her
And if she got a cheap price ring
Cool, then I won't buy her nice things
You see, her values are low, her self-respect is minimal
30 dollars is a steal, makes me feel like a criminal
10 for the movies, 20 for an entree 
Take her to the house and tossed her up the sautee
Dip her, then I flip her on her tummy first
Yeah, you know I gotta get my money's worth
You see, the rule of the game is, you pay to play

See, I call her up, and it's cool for me any day
All there is is an initiation fee
Fronted one time, now it's always free
But a sucker-punk mark keeps payin' the freak
Got sprung on the pussy cause his game was weak
You better hope you can afford the hoe
Cause if you miss a month the rate, she'll be out the do'
Lookin' for the highest bidder that wants to get with her

Punks lease her with an option to buy, but I rent her
30 dollars and I made you sin?
It was cool for a night, now I'ma trade you in
And let me tell you bout the trade-in policy
You trade a freak in and get a woman with quality
One with values and high standards
Not a freak with no fuckin' manners
I need more than a piece of meat
Most freaks can only fuck bare gettin' sleep
What does that sound like to you?
Well, for the right price, player, you got yourself a prostitute

There's a fine line between a girlfriend and a prostitute
But you'se a trick, you thought she loves you, but it's not the truth
It's always odd when you're fuckin' your lady
That you always seem to fuck her on payday
So when you're 200 short, you never trip
A good fuck and 'I love you' is some bullshit
It's a routine, not a new thing, every paycheck
She was bitchin' last night, now she's alright
You never tripped on her attitude adjustment
On payday she be callin' you her husband

I got a plead with my homies
Because when I was broke a lotta bitches didn't know me
Shit like this occurs cause of punks like you
Give em money, pay they rent, buy they clothes and buy they food
The hoes get spoiled and sprung on the treatment
If you step to her broke, then you're turned down frequent
Yeah, you got your high-siders in the drop coupes
Let her ride front seat, then you knock boots
Girls try to play real sweet and innocent

But what they really want is salary and benefits
Damn, I ain't sayin' I'm a stingy miser
But if you play me like a punk, you'll be layin' in kaiser
Usin' sex as a bargainin' tool
So you can get my credit cards and charge em up, fool
Hoes posin' as girlfriends tryin' to get over on me
Playin' themselves just like a tramp, I do em like ???
Now I got another victim, so let me get a quick one
My pants on one leg when I pound and never kiss em
Shit, you want to act like a hoe? Then be a real one
I'ma treat you like you ought, make you feel dumb
When I'm fuckin' I'ma yank it out 
Shove you in your ass, make you fall on your face so you think about
How cheap and sleazy and trampy and stragglin' you really are

For some money or to ride in someone's silly car
Don't you feel like a jackass?
Man, on your hands and knees that fast
A little dinner and a movie is a joke
Cause when it's over, you're still goin' home broke
Now to all the homeboys, let me ask you somethin'
How many of y'all know you got a real woman?
Try to analyze and think practical
Cause if she's sellin' you her sex, then you smack the hoe
And stop callin' her your girlfriend
And treat her like she wants you to
Just like a prostitute",Prostitute

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

It started at the ice cream parlor, 8 o'clock, she said call her
So that I can come and get her 'fore she's picked up by her father
So I smashed up in the Malibu
How would you feel watchin a fine thick hoe just smile at you?
Dick was rock hard from the start, I couldn't tame him
I didn't want her to see it, so I tried real hard to aim him
I tried to put it to the left, then put it to the right, between my thighs
But I was embarrassed cause I was wearin sweat pants showin my dick rise
Man, I knew she saw it, cause it stood up like a totem pole
Butterflies in my stomach as my scrotums roll
Then she glanced out my window movin her hand up my lap
She was goin for the dick, I knew the cap
Then she moved her hands up by my nutsack
As her other fingers pressed by my buttcrack
Then she grabbed it, squeezed it, jacked it
Got me out my drawers in the car, damn, she macked it
The she put her succulent lips
Right up on the helmet of my gold-ass dick
All you heard was slurpin and sirpin
As she was workin with my hand on her head jerkin, whole car swervin
Immaculate head, man, you can't beat this
Swallowed my dick with lips and tongue and done it all teethless
She went inside the work bag and then brought out the whipped cream
I went to the house and parked it and said 'let me serve this dickfiend'
Laid me on my back, put the whipped cream on my dick
She sprayed it in my ass and licked the split
Oh

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
I got my whipped, now I want my nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

Do you want this dick, tell me that you want this dick (I want it)
Put your legs on my back, clamp tight, let me run it
I was pullin, long-dickin, hittin the walls
I felt the pussy juice just drenched my balls
Pussy hole tight, wet and succulent
Soundin like some firecrackers pop when I was fuckin it
Talkin dirty to me, sayin, ""Fuck me harder, baby""
I start dig in that pussy poundin, had her wild and actin crazy
Rolled her ass over with one motion, never came out
Long-dickin it from the back, she screamed and called my name out
(Oh Goldy!) Big smooth round ass on my stomach
So I start to slap it, ""Do you want it?"" (Yes, I want it)
So I laid back with my dick still inside it
With her back to me, up and down, baby, ride it
Nothin but a long stiff dick in her cock
Deep, had her yellin, ""Ooh yeah, that's the spot""
So I start to pump it hard on my back drilling it
She was about to nut and I was too cause I was feeling it
Then she start nuttin, but I didn't want to, I said, ""Hold up""
Start her around facin me, then pulled her down and slowed up
Suckin on her earlobes, I'm fuckin romantically
My nut went away within, I was back to fuckin frantically
She was nuttin, she was tired, she was weak, she was whinin
Said she couldn't take no more and said she's 'bout to start cryin
By now I could feel my nut oozin up my shaft
Muscles gettin sore in my thighs and my calf
Started poundin the pussy faster, faster, ooh, I'm bout to nut
Come on, baby, oh - fuck...

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
I got my whipped cream and nuts, now I want my cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

I got a cravin, honey been savin, givin me the appetite
Watchin her grow and preppin her mind, she's ready to give me the cat tonight
I wrapped her up, packaged her, she's ready for delivery
After tonight I popped that cherry and she'll always remember me
The first man that told her and showed her how to fuck
The first man to lick her and show her how to suck
Now let me take my time and say that she is 17
Fine and thick, never been licked a dick, the girl is heaven-clean
Start suckin on her titties, slid my finger in her pussy
Her hair was trimmed neat, I sho' hate when they bushy
She was squirmin and breathin hard, my finger had her stuck
I wonder how she'll feel when I really start to fuck
Young bitch don't know what she wants till I teach her
I could lick her pussy, but my dick's the main feature
Took my time putting it in, but you know that I was urgin
To fel the warm pussy of this tight young virgin
I made her look at my dick, play with my dick and squeeze my balls
Until there were no problems at all
I want this dick to be her best friend, soon she'll learn to love it
And takin it upon herself to start to suck it and rub it
I put the dick in her mouth, but she bit it
Told her to use her lip jaws and tongue and she did it
Now I broke the ice and the fear is now over
Laid her on her back and put her legs up on my shoulder
Gently inserted the mushroom head of my dick
She took it for a second, then she pushed me out quick
The tight snappy cock had my dick long and so hard
It took many tries till I really got to go far
When I got inside, I didn't start pumpin
Cause everytime I pulled my dick out she was jumpin
So I fucked her slow, then I start to pick the pace up
She's screamin, squished her face up as we tore the fuckin place up
Her pussy was so tight, on my dick when I was through
I pulled it inside out and tore the skin, need some tissue
Wiped the blood offa me, offa her and off the bed
Pussy throbbin, irritated, can't close her legs
Popped her cherry, now it doesn't matter who is after me
Cause the pussy's always mine, end of verse three

Very hard
At that time to find
And belonging

Without conditions, without staring at my outward appearance

Fascinated for my purity, she let herself be kissed

Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow

It's been your flag I'm flying
But I'm sick of crying
Why did you choose to deceive me?
Was your plan just to kiss, fuck and leave me?

Is that I will never need you more than now

It's not from my lack of trying
You've got a fear of flying high
You have lost your patience
I see myself sink in your estimations
Forget the salutations
Just please study these tears
Your bitter words they just confirm my fears
Gonna let it fuck up all the years
Yet I will not need you more than now

Beautiful bitch, I could consider this a simple glitch
You're just a hopeless stitch in time
But then for your crimes

Buried secrets and fiery showdowns
Lost days in between

Put on all the things you wore and wear them out
We'll collide before you know and I apologize
For shutting up and leaving slow when I'm around
I'll be right in front of you when I've got it all figured out
To be the only one who knows what to do when there ain't no doubt
And all this time will feel like seconds now
And all this time will feel like moments now
So keep the light on, watch them all rush round
And through it all keep smiling
Do whatever you may decide on
And any place or any time
Through it all you're shining
Just trying to make it right
I won't fight

I don't want to be here when you could be somewhere else

Where only dust is falling?

If I had something to say I'd say what I mean
How'd you lose all your words? I swear it's obscene, I curse
How'd you look at yourself as the mirror turns green?
Yeah, only the fools ignore us
Everyone 'round here lives in silence

I could wait all my life for someone to think
I can't open your eyes but I can make you blink at me

Believe me, 'cause baby I won't lie

'Cause if they say that you're wrong
Don't cry, you're making it worse
And if they say that you're wrong
Don't cry

A-one, two, three, stop stranglin' me
I'll keep breathing, no matter how hard you try
A-seven, eight, nine, you'll never take me alive
You could steal me, but babe, you could not buy me

Don't cry, you're making it worse
And if they say that you're wrong

You came back to me

Passing ghosts in a street
I chase them away with alcohol

With nothing of significance
Besides a shadow of a dream

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing

And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

The heavy sweetness like to make me sick. 
And the dogs, my God, they're hungry all the time 
And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

Came back too soon...

Em saber se ela tinha vontade ou não
E se tinha e transou,você tem a certeza
de que foi uma coisa maior para dois
Você leu em seu rosto o gosto,o fogo,o gozo da
festa
E deixou que ela visse em você
Toda a dor do infinito pra zer
E se ela deseja e você não deseja
Você nega,alega cansaço ou vira de lado 
Ou se deixa levar na rotina
tal qual um menino tão só no antigo banheiro
folheando as revistas,comendo a s figuras
as cores das fotos te dando a completa emoção
são pe rguntas tão tolas de uma pessoa
Não ligue,não ouça são pontos de interrogação
E depois desses anos no escuro do quarto
quem te diz que não é só o vicio da obrigação
pois com a outra você faz de tudo
lembrando daquela tão santa
que é dona do teu coração 
Eu preciso é ter consciência
do que eu represento nesse exato momento
no exato instante na cama,na lama,na grama",Ponto de Interrogação
Gonzaguinha,"Eu apenas queria que você soubesse
Que aquela alegria ainda está comigo
E que a minha ternura não ficou na estrada
Não ficou no tempo, presa na poeira

Eu apenas queria que você soubesse
Que esta menina hoje é uma mulher
E que esta mulher é uma menina
Que colheu seu fruto, flor do seu caminho

Eu apenas queria dizer
A todo mundo que me gosta
Que, hoje, eu me gosto muito mais
Porque me entendo muito mais também

E que a atitude de recomeçar
é todo dia , toda hora
é se respeitar na sua força e fé
é se olhar bem fundo até o dedão do pé

Eu apenas queria que você soubesse
Que essa criança brinca nesta roda
E não teme o corte das novas feridas
Pois tem a saúde que aprendeu com a vida",Eu Apenas Queria Que Você Soubesse
Gonzaguinha,"Quando eu soltar a minha voz por favor entenda
Que palavra por palavra eis aqui uma pessoa se entregando
Coração na boca, peito aberto, vou sangrando

Sã o as lutas dessa nossa vida que eu estou cantando
Quando eu abir minha garganta essa força tanta
Tudo que você ouvir, esteja certa que estarei vivendo
Veja o brilho nos meus olhos e o tremor nas minhas mãos

E o meu corpo tão suado, transbordando toda raça e emoção
E se eu chorar e o sol molhar o meu sorriso
Não se espante, cante

Que o teu canto é minha força pra cantar
Quando eu soltar a minha voz por favor entenda
É apenas o meu jeito de viver
O que é amar",Sangrando
Gonzales,"If you don't look good
Then I don't look good
Then we don't look good

So let's make it work please
Straight to work please
Up your shirt sleaves

And if you're done talkin'
Then I'm done talkin'
So we're done talkin'

So let's connect minds
It's past your bed time
And I'm on deadline

Just cut the BS
And don't be depressed
You need to be stressed

Don't forget this
You're my apprentice
You need to sweat this

Just feel the tension
Your teeth are clenching
And rev' the engine

Let it guide you
And get inside you
And get like I do

Ah, ah, working together
Ah, ah, livin' together
Ah, ah, dyin' together
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
(x2)

And you don't look good
Then I don't look good
Then we don't look good

And if you mess you
It's like I messed up
And we both messed up

Just don't be lazy
And don't betray me
'Cause it drives me crazy

And when I say \""crazy\""
You say \""how crazy?\""
I say \""real crazy!\""

And if the boss is happy
Then she will thank me
And you will thank me

But if the boss is cranky
Then she won't thank me
And I won't be happy

I tell you frankly
If I get cranky
Then I get spankings

So no hanky-panky
You cannot flank me
You don't outrank me

Ah, ah, working together
Ah, ah, livin' together
Ah, ah, dyin' together
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
(x2)


If you don't look good
Then I don't look good
Then we don't look good

And I'm so controlling
We're both controlling
I control the whole thing

Just stick with me kid
You're stuck with me kid
To keep my secrets

See, I'm hard to work with
But all the work is
Hardly worthless

Ah, ah, working together
Ah, ah, livin' together
Ah, ah, dyin' together
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
(x2)


Working together,
Working together,
Feels like forever;
Working together... (x2)
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh",Working Together
Gonzales,"I'm a dog shaped ashtray
I'm a shrugging moustache wearing a speedo tuxedo
I'm a movie with no plot, written in the back seat of a piss powered taxi
I'm an imperial armpit, sweating Chianti
I'm a toilet with no seat, flushing tradition down
I'm socialist lingerie

I'm diplomatic techno
I'm gay pastry and racist cappuccino
I'm an army on holiday in a guillotine museum
I'm a painting made of hair, on a nudist beach, eating McDonald's
I'm a novel far too long
I'm a sentimental song
I'm a yellow tooth waltzing with wrap around shades on
Who am I?
I am Europe",I Am Europe
Gonzales,"How could I ever stop?
My position is missionary, I finish on top
And while you're relaxin', I take action
Guinness world record, I beat it, Michael Jackson

Never stop, I workaholic
Like spit sweat splatter Jackson Pollock
But I'm not an artist, I just work the hardest
I beat it to a pulp, just ask Jarvis

Studio to studio, I drink juice,
Produce tons of new shit, like a booty hole
Show to show, full throttle, backstage,
No models, no bathroom, I piss in a bottle

And after the show a lot of autographs,
Man, music is a joke I try not to laugh
I just try to enjoy the grind
My position is doggy, I come from behind

Underground, underdog, underrated
Under stress, under pressure, under-appreciated
Man, this is war
Where careers get killed and that's not a metaphor, like

My mindset is military, like
My attitude is Hitchcock, very scary
Persistence, instincts,
Go the distance, prove my existence

That's why I never stop
'cause it's not Chilly, it's Lily, who makes really clever pop
I just do it in a different way
I'm kind of sort of indirect ricochet,

Chilly like Pinochet, I don't make hits, I take risks
And make flops like floppy disks
I still stay professional and not sloppy
I try to be original, not a photocopy

Can't stop, won't stop
Harder, faster better stronger, I listen to the robots
I'm still doing things, so don't cue the strings,
It ain't over 'til Beth Ditto sings

So how could I ever quit
My position? Don't fuck with me - celibate
Groupie go home, you can find another guy
Man, music is a joke, I try not to cry

Sounds crazy, but the underground's lazy
Maybe just a bunch of big babies
And they're crying 'til they're on the guestlist,
Then they puke at 6 am - English breakfast

See I always hatch a new scheme
No room for the club or a pub in my routine
I don't judge you if you're part of a true scene
But me? I could be anywhere - blue screen

At the Grammys getting nominated
Or trying to be a piano playing Larry David
Flirting with rap, workin' for Birkin
Behind your favorite singer I just might be lurkin'

And I'm certain when they close the curtains
My life will be a B-movie shot by Tim Burton
And if I lack authenticity
Remember authenticity is often shitty

So please, no pity,
You can never melt this ice-cold heart between my two titties
'cause what's life but a board game?
And if you play the game then you're never bored with more of the same

What's life but a competition
You know my name, I am bitten
I never stop
Do it again",Never Stop

Hoy decidí que debía aceptarlo
Hoy vi tus ojos en la oscuridad
Hoy fui tu adiós en la cama
Ya no hay mas que hablar

Mientras cae el sol
Mientras pienso en vos

Hoy me tomé algunos tragos y pensé
Cómo sería mi vida, que insensatez
Hoy me enamoro de tu libertad
Y ya no te tengo, que estúpido, y más allá

Siempre sale el sol
Siempre pienso en vos

Y si alrededor, te abraza el amor
Amar es este sueño despiadado
Y hoy, te fuiste y hoy vuelvo a cantar
Este mi tango, hermoso y fatal
Y hoy aquí espero a que te dejes llevar
Y te amo y te odio

Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine
Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"

The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"Peace with me now 
I never thought I could know how 
Sleep in Your love 
I feel Your arms that keep me now 

Could never be without You 
Could never be without Your love 
I feel You from above 
Don't ever want to be alone 

You'll never leave me drifting 
You'd never take away the peace 
Or run away from me 
Need Your love

Baby the man at your house he mean nothin

And my dick get bigger and bigger...

Chorus

Ease rooms, get back in the mix

Shake that shit x 8",Dirty Dancing
Gonzoe,"Can't escape my love
 Here how it goes
 You and me
 Up and down but maybe this time
 Well get it right
 Worth the fight
 'Cause love is something you can't shake
 When it breaks
 All it takes is some trying
 
 [Chorus:]
 If you feel like leaving
 I'm not gonna beg you to stay
 Soon you'll be finding
 You can run you can hide but you can escape my love.
 So if you go
 You should know
 It hard to just forget the past
 So fast
 It was good
 It was bad but it was real and that
 All you have
 In the end our love mattered
 
 [Chorus:]
 If you feel like leaving
 I'm not gonna beg you to stay
 Soon you'll be finding
 You can run you can hide but you can escape my love.
 Here's how it goes
 All it takes is some trying

Feel this here
This my year
Year of years

They hitting me up nigga
Now I just stare
Ice up
Smash out
Hitting no fear
On the same spot I cracked up
My first 5 dollars
Same steez-aline, now wit out the popping collars
Everything bubbled out
Dash board, pull it out
Girls in the backseat running they mouth
Switch up, shut up
Kiss my boo before she nut up
Spitting it all juss trying to get some cut up
Floating
Somebody rolling a blunt
Somebody choking
Somebody pass the blunt
Constantly smoking
The life, of a young tycoon
Roll up green
Pop X and lace 'em
An this life I lead I ain't set
If I ain't got a whip wit a grip or the woman I slip.
Come on.

Racing jet skis screaming ""Cowabunga!""
Top of the world
Yup me and my partners
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime

Skidding through the islands
Be the first to bust
Grab on my nuts
Scream in cuts
Then I smoke the famous weed wit Dutch
Wit no crutch
My Lex got stick shift wit no clutch
Push a button on the back of the steering wheel and skee-skirt like Starsky 
And Hutch

Quickly bust they enemies
Get cheese like Vito Genevies

Make 'em bow down kiss they ring

Tell them girls any lie you can think of
We finna get fucked
We perving
Off nade
And the Alazae working
Who searching for a stiff who want to follow
And I voulen-teer
Wrap yo lips around my stuff like a bottle
Here
I shake it, and take it
And take it
You suckers can't make it
Cover it wit hatred
Capitol punishment
Make you taste it
Break down the mind of a Manson
Cause they basic, no care
To my right hand
Swear to bear arms
Bust for my loved ones
An trust none
Got money an funds
I call upon an worship
More evil than good, I fully work it
Shots in ?
The world go perfect wit dollar bills
My wounds can't heal fool
My world too real for dollar bills.

Drank until Wednesday and left his wife
Thursday through Saturday he lost everything
Woke up on Sunday, miserable again
I remember baseball games and workin' on the car
Told me that he loved me and that I would go far
Showed me how to work hard and stick up for myself
Wish it wasn't too hard to listen to himself

One eviction notice, and a bill for therapy,

You're living all alone 'cause you left us all at home,

A fourth and fifth and sixth but that was yesterday,

With all your cool friends, they're really cool,

We were together all the way
An endless path unbroken
But now there is a time
A torture less sublime
Our souls are locked and frozen 

Once we were years ahead but now those thoughts are dead
Let me go
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye
Let me go
A change of heart a change of mind and heaven fell that night
Let me go 

I tried but could not bring
The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime
Now everything is thunder

Nighttime I don't need the
Daytime all I want is
Nighttime I don't need the

The hope of it survives
The facts of life unspoken
The only game in town

They were the best years of our lives
I'll turn the last card down",Let Me Go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)

We didn't see him no more

Good Charlotte,"One day I woke up
I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Cash Dogg was barking
Went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother
Told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter
I said I'd miss her
And I signed that good bye

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine (the day that I died)

We took a drive and
We drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations
We talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
Summer nights
Drunken fights
Mistakes we made
Did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I died

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone but I feel just fine

You know the happiest day of my life,
I know the happiest day of my life

How you feel

How this fell apart

Do you think about your sons?
Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down
How do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're all right?

But we're all right
We're all right

It's been a long hard road without you by my side
Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life
It's not okay,
But we're alright
I remember the days, you were a hero in my eyes
But those were just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive

The days I spent so cold, so hungry
Were full of hate
I was so angry
Those scars run deep inside this tattooed body
There's things I'll take, to my grave
But I'm okay
I'm okay

As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were smokin' crack
McDonalds wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.

A ghost of you
Is all that I have left
Is all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

With pictures of us living on these walls

Wondering I'm wondering if its you
That I feel if its you that I feel
Haunting me forever

So I know when people are creepin' about
These people are freakin' me out (these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all want to know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see?

I just want to live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me

I rock a law suit when I'm goin' to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talking on the phone
Got an interview with the Rolling Stone
They're saying, â??Now you're rich, now you're famousâ??
Fake ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
Your first hit aren't you ashamed
Of the life, of the life, of  the life

Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me

Stop your messing around boy
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans boy
Said everyone of our teachers
Look out, you better play it safe
Never know what hard times will come your way
We say, where we're comin' from
We've already seen the worst that this life can bring
Now we expect it everywhere that we go

They can't buy their way into heaven

They won't reach up into heaven

And they can't see the innocent lives
The pointless suffering
And in my heart I want to undo all this murder
And get back the innocent lives
Open cages and stop their luxurious murder, it's murder

And no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven

Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

The night we met, all black
The color of your dress, all black
The seats in my Cadillac, all black

As long as I could remember I dreamed in black and white
As I grew up and the sun went down I never felt more alright
My mother she use to tell me...Son you better get to church
And its a dark dark world and the people out there and you know its only getting worse
Never been much for weddings or anniversaries but
I go to a funeral if I'm invited any day of the week
Some people say I sound strange some say I'm not right
But I find beauty in this world every single night

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

The night we met, all black
The color of your dress, all black
The seats in my Cadillac, all black
I used to see red, but now just all black

I sat down at her table at the end of the night
She was having black coffee and a cigarette, she wasn't wearing white
She said, people tell me that I am strange that I am not right
The only time I feel alright is in the dead of night
I think I found the one for me

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

The night we met, all black
The color of your dress, all black
The seats in my Cadillac, all black

I remember feeling so alive
The night I look into her eyes,
Take a look at my life",All Black

Good Charlotte,"When you call she doesn't answer, when you write she doesn't answer
You go out you see him with her, she told you she was sick at home
The ring you gave her thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her, he doesn't even care at all

As she follows him around like you follow her around
He doesn't even care and your figuring out
The only way your gonna keep somebody around
Well I'm about to let you know

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman is gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she is the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can't you see she's the way she's crying
Well that's what keeps her trying, she knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants
There's truth about this, you say you want to be noticed
Well if you want to be noticed you gotta learn to break some hearts
Don't try to understand

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman is gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she is the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart her heart

Can't you see what you've done?
What I've become, what I've become
Can't you see? Can't you see?

I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand but now I see

There's something I don't wanna understand
The only way a woman is gonna want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands

Don't tell her she is the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you got to give

All that time he was taken her for granted
She wants to see if there's more than he gave, she's looking for

He calls her up he's tripping on the phone line
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
Knows she's moving it, knows she's using it
Now he's losing it and she don't care

Everybody put up your hands up say, I don't wanna be in love,
Feel the beat now if you got nothing left say I don't wanna be in love
Don't give up now, you got a reason to live say, I don't wanna be in love

Working hard to buy the things she mentioned
He was dedicated by most suckers hated
That girl was fine but she didn't appreciate him

She calls him up, she's tripping on the phone line
He had to get out and he ain't coming home now
Now lets try to forget it that's how he got with her
When he first met her and when they first got together

Everybody put up your hands up say, I don't wanna be in love,
Feel the beat now if you got nothing left say I don't wanna be in love
Don't give up now, you got a reason to live say, I don't wanna be in love

To the beat , to the beat, to the beat,
You got nothing to lose don't be afraid to get down
We break up, its something that we do now,
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's OK let it go, get out there and find someone (some more)
It's too late to be tripping on the phone here
Get off the wire you knew everything is good here
Stop what you're doing you don't want to ruin your chance to find a new one

And rock n' roll dreamin' was what saved us

Life was simple,
Roger was working round the clock to make a living,
No computers, none of that, he used his two hands,
Ignored the cold
Wore, his word to keep him warm,

On the weekends,
He'd load the car up with the kids and they'd go fishing,
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession,
Damn right he smiled a lot
They lay awake at night
So in love

It was a good good year
The kids were alright,
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
In 1979
It was a good, good year.

In the morning,
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen,
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him
And he would hold her tight
When they were newlyweds

He'd say maybe
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready,
And they would dance so slow to ""Just the Way You Are"".

It was a good, good year
The kids were all right,
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
In 1979
It was a good, good year.

All the decades and the years have passed,
Not every family is built to last,
No time can take away these memories
Remember when you said to me
That we'd be all right.

Oh oh oh
The kids were all right,
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,

Your touch is so electric
And looking in your eyes

I've never felt so alive

It's so-so real
The way you feel
How fast my heart is beating
And we're breathing together now

As we float out
Above the clouds
I swear I'll never let you down

I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right now in this moment
I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right here standing next to you

And looking in your eyes

All that I remember is that you had me at hello.
I knew right when I met her that I wouldn't take it slow.
The more we heard the music, the more we got in synch.
The more I kept you laughing, the less I stopped to think.
The last thing I remember, you said this place is beat.
It must have gotten crazy, 'cause I can't recall a thing.

Last night (last night) can't remember (remember)
What happened? (What happened) Where'd we go?
I woke up (woke up) this morning (this morning)
Where's my car? Where's my keys? Where's my clothes?
I feel my heads still spinning
But I'm doing alright (eh)
'Cause I think I just had the best night of my life (oh)
Last night (last night) can't remember (remember)
What happened? Did it happen? Last night

Everyone's been calling like I've been gone for days.
There's a note left on the table and all it says is 'thanks'.
It's starting to get dark outside and I'm finally awake.
I'm feeling kind of guilty, is there something I can take?
There's lipstick on my collar, I'm piecing it together.
Then I see a picture of me and you from,

Last night (last night) can't remember (remember)
What happened? (What happened) Where'd we go?

What happened? Did it happen? Last night

And did I get the chance to say, that I wanted you to stay?
There's things I can't explain, 'cause my brain don't work that way.
Don't call this a one night stand, no, it wasn't planned.
Wasn't in my head, but I just wanna do it again and again, and again, just like,

In every moment of your life
In every tear you've ever cried
In every painful last goodbye

So when the system breaks you down
Just listen to the sound

What do I do when it's all been done
When the words have all been sung
And I've given up the best of me

When I'm hanging by a thread
And I've got nothing to give
Let the music play

Why life is filled with so much pain
But to the flowers that will grow
In the places it don't rain

Forgotten words that I once sung
Telling me to just keep holding on

I've never been more alone than here
I turn and face my darkest fear
I just got to keep on keeping on

And when it all comes crashing down
Listen to the sound

But seeing is believing,
Can't believe it,

It's gonna be a good night,

The first thing I see is the sun over the mountains.
West Hastings Street, anxiously waiting.
That's when I feel that God is all around me.
And I don't know where to begin,
To say I'm sorry for my sins,
So I collapse into your open arms

I'm sorry it took me so long,
Out here, for me to find my way back home.
I didn't have a reason,
For when I stopped believing,
But I needed you to know
That I'm right where I belong.

Now I see everything clearly,
In the rear view,
That you were right beside me.
So long ago, my voice of reason,
It disappeared, along with my convictions
And now I know where it begins,
Accept forgiveness for my sins,
And just collapse into your open arms

I'm sorry it took me so long,
Out here, for me to find my way back home.
I didn't have a reason,
For when I stopped believing,
But I needed you to know
That I'm right where I belong.

If all we are is where we've been,
Then I know where I want to be.
No matter how far I drift again,
You keep a light on for me
Out here, so I can find my way back home
I didn't have a reason,
For when I stopped believing,
But I needed you to know
That I'm right where I belong now, with you,

So I'll stay quiet in your arms.

It's every little thing for my head down to her feet
Out of the magazine
And I see her on the TV

I love the song she sings
'Cause when I turn around it's like she singing to me
And every word she means
Like it could be about me (it could be about me)

She's sounds to me
She's sounds like sex on the radio
I love to hear her scream
And when I push play she's screaming in stereo

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know that we would meet
At one of those shows they do for the radio
And when she looked at me
All I said was hello (all I said was hello)

I took her out to eat
'Cause we were in a city that neither one of us knew
We never went to sleep
'Cause when the sun came up, we knew that we would have to go

I love to hear her scream
And when I push play she's screaming in stereo

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She put sex on the radio, sex on the radio
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She sounds like sex on the radio

She put sex on the radio, sex on the radio

I've got to admit, this feeling's legit
I don't wanna stop and she don't want me to quit
But she gets a little nervous for what we do,
Scare what they would say,
What they would talk about if they knew

Heard her sing a song and I knew that she would write about it
Saw her in a magazine, I knew that she could keep it quite
Keep it in the sheets, the radio the beats
Between you and me, we'll throw away the key

She's sounds to me
She's sounds like sex on the radio
I love to hear her scream
And when I push play she's screaming in stereo

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Good Charlotte,"I had nothing to say 
'Cause I could never fake it
So I just stood by
And I watched all them take it
If we lose our way
We will learn how to shake it
All that shit that fucks you up
We learn to knock it off and just walk away

'Cause you know we ain't got no soul now
Even when they said we sold out
We keep swingin' and we all just go down
Saying and playing what we think
'Cause you know we ain't got no soul now
Even when they said we sold out
We keep swingin' and we all just go down
Saying and playing what we think

You and I will work it out somehow
Come on, come on
See the look on your face 
Yeah, I know what you're thinking
So should I even waste my time?
Stop the words before they sink in
You know your love is saying
That you're never gonna change
Well, artists sell their soul
Bottles of pills, and empty spaces

Thinking about whatever happened yesterday
I don't wanna let love slip away
'Cause you've been gone awhile
She will stay, she's here to stay

We said we'd never break it

Tell me has it changed?

We're somewhere unforgiven

Tell me has it changed?

I just want to see you laugh again

The ones where you don't know me

If I could get away from the old me

But I'll survive, right now I'm dyin' just to breathe in
Just to be alive
Just to get away from the old me

There's a triage in my living room
She checks my vital signs

I'm dying tonight
But no one is crying
It's not alright no matter what they say (woah)

We used to be so tight (yeah right)

Good Charlotte,"Come on, get up and go
Another true story, another true story

Running through airports, waiting at stations
Hoping you'd be there, wanting to tell you my name
Hoping you'd see me, stuck in the outfield
Hoping you'd notice and you'd know who I am now

All of my issues were dragging me down
I always wanted to be someone else
And then we both said

We were the young and hopeless
We were the broken youth
You're not the only one they used
I was in the outfield too
Somehow we found redemption
We found a love that's true
My life was leading me to you
I was in the outfield too

I was thinking about school, it was so fucking painful
My parents were both such a wreck
I needed to lean on a friend
And you were stuck out there, somewhere in California
And I was daydreaming about falling asleep next to

You helped me face all the darkness in me (You redeem me)
You shine your line in the space in between
Now we both say

We were the young and hopeless
We were the broken youth
You're not the only one they used
I was in the outfield too
Somehow we found redemption
We found a love that's true
My life was leading me to you

What you say? What you say?
We could leave, just forget it all and live forever
Run away, run away
We can go, we can drive to somewhere new
If you say, if you say, we should stay
I don't mind as long as we're together
So what you say? What you say?
Will you stay? Come on, tell me that we'll live forever
Tell me that we'll live forever

You're not the only one they used
