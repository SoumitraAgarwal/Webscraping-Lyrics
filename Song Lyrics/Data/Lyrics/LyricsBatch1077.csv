Patrick Williams,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night
Patrick Williams,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Patrick Williams,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Patrick Williams,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young
Patrick Wolf,"A boy like me is told
He is both nine and ninety
And a boy like me
Should shut those books
Join the army
And a boy like me
Would never be seen
Fighting for peace
I want total chaos
And a holiday home in the east

And a boy like me
Should know much better than
To raise his flag in stormy weather
I just can't get enough electric shocks
I wanna buy a lighthouse
And ride a giraffe on the rocks

I don't give up

I want two dogs
Two cats
A big kitchen
And a welcome mat

I want all this
And all I shall have
Oh no, I don't give up

A boy like me
Don't ever give up
Give up his dream
No
",A Boy Like Me
Patrick Wolf,"I was still a child when you caught me and tied me to your bed
You gave me shoes and pretty clothes, and I gave you what I had between my legs
Just a right of passage, you held me down and said
""I'm gonna be your right of passage, so boy you better spread, spread em""

You said..""run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from the child catchers hands""

I wrote your name in my shit across the town to warn the kids of your bloodshed
When I chased you with a burning cross, my mother she wanted you dead

She said ""run run run as fast as you can but you can't run run from our law given hand""

You said 
""well I've got no time for victims and I don't think it was all that bad
And if you can't run to save yourself well then you deserve to be had
This is the age of constipation, this is the age of martyrdom
I think you even enjoyed it, I think I even saw you come""",The Childcatcher
Patrick Wolf,"Since I met you. this house has started to decay
And every wall that once was clean. has turned a shade of grey.

So much to rescue. so much you just can't understand
Now the streets are dark and empty. and the problems in our hands.

I can't leave you. see back home my house is falling down.
I can't leave you. and back home my house is falling down

Since I met you. my basement has started to bleed
The floors are all collapsing. still I'm begging to be free",Demolition
Patrick Wolf,"Sundark on darker streets. its violent times for weary feet.
Carjackers and bullet showers. a yellow sign. too many fools in power
But see. I will be gone by morning. my dear friend I lost pur fight
Forget me. I wash myself in your grey slowing night. 

coming down from darkened heights. I taste the thames with my cycle lights
By saint paul's by big ben. by god's name, I repent.
But see. I will be gone by morning my dear london goodnight
Forget me, I wash my haself in your grey river light.",London
Patrick Wolf,"I was once a boy. 
'Til I cut my penis off
And I grew a hairy skull 
Of stubborn fire

Then I was a girl. 
'Til I sewed my hole up
And I grew a hairy heart 
Of dark desire
But 
There's no answer. just surrender
Send all your barriers into the fire

And
Let no foot. mark your ground
Let no hand hold you down.
You were once so sad
Till you cut your suffer off

Now you please yourself
And fight your own wars
And you were once so weak
'Til you sewed your wounds up

Now you've learnt to sing
About sun and shine!

Be you own hero
Be your own savior
Send all your suffering
Into the fire",Lycanthropy
Patrick Wolf,"It was seven in the morning when the spark 
Began to give. the bath was spilling over, my 
Self pity spilling with it, so I, I fled the country
To start it all again and found myself in Paris in 
The cemetery rain. 

Dear Anne came to me and took me by the arm
Showed me old disasters embedded in the palm
Warned me of a lady with the sun behind her head.
With a a granite neck, a singer who can never sing 
Again, but you, my love:

You must come, come to joy, turn your head to the sun
Its down to you, you can shine, you can shake all the 
Sorrow from your palm, its down to you if you dare 
To come to joy.

What was it I ran from, what burnt away inside? 
Four hundred schoolboys and a lawyer at my side
Always running with these legs going nowhere
A ghost in the system, and angel on the stairs
But oh! this time

I shall turn, turn my head to the sun
They are marching out of me, one by one
Walking free. oh! they're going out of
Oh! I can feel it moving, this time I'm really moving.
Are you ready to come, come to joy well its really down to 
You if you dare to enjoy, its down to you, hold the key
In your hands, it's all in the palm of your hands.",Paris
Patrick Wolf,"I was stumbling into battle
I was walking into walls
'Till I walked myself to Peter
And I let my shadows fall.

He's a boy who never ages.
Rides a goat around the lake
He's a friend who never falters
To change my circling fate. 

He said dance across the battle
But punch straight through that wall
Though your knuckles may be bleeding
They'll be healed before the fall. 

After war comes peace
After peace comes war
But remember 
If it weren't for fighting. 
We'd be fighting for ever more",Peter Pan
Patrick Wolf,"London, did you have to 
Take my child away? 
You buried him under 
Rent and low pay. 
I've been cycling in circles 
Round your empty streets. 
I've been searching 
In the pouring rain. 

I've been going alone 
To the cinema
I've been stealing all my food
From the electric avenue
Now the pigeons gather
Round my feeding hand. 
And we talk til the evening fades.

I have learnt how it goes 
What you wait for never shows
And what you least wanted
Holds you down like a stone.
Just like a stone.

Now I feed the birds. 
Day after day.
Only they can hear me pray for 
A lighter heart. a lighter load
To be moving. moving. moving 
My way home.",Pigeon Song
Patrick Wolf,"The day our house collapsed 
I went down stream. 
I followed the swans 
Like I follow my dreams. 

Oh! I was living on borrowed time in a 
Borrowed house for a borrowed crime.
In need of help I came to your door.
Saw the spike of the railings from 
The 28/3rd floor. 
Singing 
""Build your castle, stop collecting stones
And the river bed shall not be your home""

To the lighthouse my friend!
I bless your words and education
To the lighthouse my friend. 
Just go! just go! 
To the lighthouse my friend.
I am sorry that you came to find
""Great great minds against themselves conspire'

Now the bombs drop around our feet, 
Do we throw them back 
Or bow and greet them. 
Everyone now, is so terrified 
Of the glowing dark 
And those orange skies.

""Build your castle, stop throwing stones 
Cause those fire birds are coming down on our homes""

To the lighthouse my friends
It cannot even be a question
To the lighthouse my friends
We must go, we must go",To the Lighthouse
Patrick Wolf,"Walk tall beneath these trees boy
You monolith not scarred by fallout
Us wolves were right behind you and lucifer will never find you
Oh no!

the moon, let it guide you, when selene comes, we'll alll know how to fight
Dear fenrir, my saviour, come and eat the ones, we know who taste the best

I know just where you've been boy, I've watched you by the stream
And don't be afraid of the dark 'cause the darkness is simply a womb for the lonely
Swallow your pride and walk with us through the trees and hills
Oh yes! your english eyes they are turning red
I I I I oh I I I I

the moon, let it guide you and I shall find you a home in our heartland, a heart in our homeland
Until the moon is down, until the moon is down",Wolf Song
Patrick Wolf,"In a time of loneliness
I fell into your strong open arms
And in those arms you loved me well
You hid me in your charm

And in that charm we headed south
Knowing nothing of my demons

There were devils in the winds that night
Walking fire among the hills
And many voices called me out to the cliffs
But you held me safe
You wrestled me still

Wiping the black blood from my mouth
Speeding into nowhere

It starts in Penzance where the winds are born
And follows the track of this train
And just like my love calling out for you
It is calling me back again (and again)

""What a beautiful town!""
I shouted out
Oh, but what a terrifying view
You know I wrestled with my bruised hours
Just to lie there next to you

Deep in the dark heart of the south
Speeding into nowhere

My love, come stop me
I am haunted and possessed
And with my darkest hour yet to come
It's only you, only you can stop me

Come back to Penzance where the winds are born
Just follow the track of this train
And just like this love calling out for you
It is calling me out again

So come stop me
Only you can stop me
Stop me
Now",Penzance
Patrick Wolf,"Wind in the wires
Electricity, on the edge of a cliff
Moments of transcendence
Sweet and transitory

But here comes a rage
A crippling anger
Sea birds are blown into the rocks
Beauty and grace, lost to thunder

Thunder
Pressure
Getting lower

Her waters break
The rain falls to the sea
Into a granite wave
A unit, a family

",Wind in the Wires (Clifftop Demo)
Patrick Wolf,"I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire aflame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And some one called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

When I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun.",The Hazelwood
Patrick Wolf,"And am I born to die?
To lay this body down?
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown
A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot?

Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me?
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
Waked by the trumpet's sound
I from my grave shall rise
And see the Judge with glory crowned
And see the flaming skies",Idumea
Patrick Wolf,"So long 
My friend 
There must always 
Be an end 

But all our love 
And life 
And song 
Carries on 
I carry it on 

Now the lightships 
Are guiding you 
Over the sea 

And the lightships 
Are sailing you 
Away from me 

Over the edge of the world 
The edge of the world 
Over the edge 

But I carry you on 
I carry you on 
And I carry on",Eulogy
Patrick Wolf,"While I'm asleep
My spirit crawls out
Of my belly button
And goes down to the sea

To gather the wind
The wires and the shore
To wander the hills
Like a day gone before

When beauty was in season
Oh! Beauty in season!
Endangered by reason
Great love with no law

Today I woke
And my spirit was gone
Still on the shore
Where he truly belongs

So I call
For him
Across
The wind
And
Rain

To come and bring beauty
Back in season
Oh! Beauty in season!
I'm in danger of reason
Losing love to this law

Patrick Wolf,"Drawing a line
A ship in a harbor
Yes I will go
I'll be going there soon

A blue map of Cornwall
Up on a bedroom wall
Drawing a line
I'll be following soon

But how do I follow?
What road to be choosing?
Do I follow the star
Or the gypsy king?

I recall when I was younger
There was a fire
To travel the world
And shine with a passion
But as ambition shoots blank
Day by Day
On a train from Edinburgh
To the Kings Cross rain

I see a small house
Built on the sea
I could live there alone
With a horse and a ukulele

But how do I get there?
What road to be choosing?
When the seasons so high
For losing

How do I follow
What road to be choosing?
Do I follow the star
Or the Gypsy King?",The Gypsy King

The circus girl fell off her horse and now she's paralysed

But I still have to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free

And the preachers lies are all concealed 
And all our heroes lack any conviction

So i've got to go 
I've got to go, so here i go 
I'm going to run the risk of being free 

And in this drought of truth and invention 
Whoever shouts the loudest gets the most attention 
So we pass the mic and they've got nothing to say except: 
""Bow down, bow down, bow down to your god""

By the rails that I know

And birds in the yard
Where the wild
Nettles
Grow

Growing over the door
Growing up through the walls

And cast

Patrick Wolf,"On the night train 
From the city to the south 
I saw spirits 
Crawl across the river mouth 
In skewed ascension 
With no destination 
Like this lone bachelor in me 
This constant yearning 
For great love and learning 
For the wind to carry me free 

So when the birds fly south 
I'll Reach up and hold their tails 
Pull up and out of here 
And bridle the autumn gales 
Down to the burning cliffs 
To the unrelenting roll 
To marry the untold blisses 
And anchor this lost soul 

From my window 
I saw two birds lost at sea 
I caught our reflection 
In that silent tragedy 
But with hope prevailing 
I draw galleons sailing 
In full sail billowing free 

So when the birds fly south 
We'll reach up and hold their tails 
Pull up and out of here 
And bridle the autumn gales 
I give you my hand 
The fingers unfold 
To have and forever hold 
To marry the untold blisses

To break and blossom, all to be adored

And there's blood on our sheets

Great white wings beating
In an attic, in a house, in the dead of night

Oh, is this forever, ever?
Oh, oh
Sweet Augustine, Augustine
What does this mean for us?

Does it mean that I can never change my ways?
And that's why, love, you shouldn't stay
Still you will and love me
Like a mother or a maid bringing you down, down
Down on your brazen knees
Watering the worms and the weeds
Thinking, why does love leave me so damn cold?
Now I'm getting old
And is this what it should be?
Well, is it?

Oh, my Augustine, Augustine.
Oh, is this forever, ever?
Oh, oh
Sweet Augustine, Augustine
Or do we kill this one tonight?

Yes, we will run
Come get lost with me
Slip away discreetly

So come get lost with me
We will run 'til empty

We could stay here 'til closing time

And the price is a crime
We could dance 'til our feet turn red
But the beat's so boring
And I'd rather be home in our bed

Was it worth all that war just to win

Patrick Wolf,"I wanna be a witchman

No one will wear my silver ring

Poor little turtle dove
Sitting up in pine
Mourning for your own true love
Why not me for mine?

I got hogs in the pen
And corn to feed them on
And all I want is someone

Who will feed them
When I'm dead and gone
Feed them when I'm dead
And gone

'Cause I know
I'm not going to marry in the fall
And I'm not going to marry in the spring

I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
Wear my silver no one will

Poor little turtle dove
Sitting up in pine
Mourning for your own true love
Why not me for mine?

So I went up to this mountain
To give my horn a blow
And all the boys in the valley said
Yonder comes my beau
Yonder comes my beau

'Cause I know
I'm not going to marry in the fall
And I'm not going to marry in the spring

I will never marry, marry at all
No one will wear my silver ring
Wear my silver no one will

But who will feed them
When I'm dead and gone?

Patrick Wolf,"And I walked, and I walked upon Blackdown
And I walked West Sussex sunlight up by dead man's pool
Where ma Mudlark and Lewes
Stared me down, you drunken fool

Old teenage debts engulfed my chest
As I contemplate death
Put a challenge to its glamor
And all its loss and glory

Wet afternoon breath was taken deep into my lungs
Thinking of the man I must become
My story has just begun
And I will be returning to myself soon

I've been alone for so many
Of the great moments in my life
Alone like so many
At this moment in my life asking

Father, father anyway I can help ye?
I am only just growing much better to know thee
Thank you for all the things you've given to our family
Given your whole life to your wife and my sister and me

Now I look out north of battle where our ancestors lie in grave
West to Breed where the blacksmith put root to our family name
And I get proud of my birthright, think of the things that I must leave
When I leave behind the city and the living finally

Desire, desire, desire

Desire, desire deep down inside of me
You are not the maker nor the master of me
Help me to better support my family
And better, better of a brother be

Desire, desire deep down inside of me, oh now
You are not the wrecker nor the ruler of me
Desire, desire deep down in me

Yes, I've been alone for too many
These great moments in my life
Alone like too many but desire, desire
Desire you are not the maker of me, oh now

All as I walked up on Blackdown

Generation justice wishes for world at war
Final score, media come and abhor us

These are hard times we'll work harder, harder
Through these hard times I'll work harder, harder

That we have grown up to ignore mediocrity applauded

In these hard times we'll work harder, harder
Through these hard times I'll work harder, harder
For resolution show me some revolution
This battle will be won

Forced to count the hours since Two Towers
Fell to fiction those higher powers
Putting gods to war, who keeps score
Ignorance is still adored

And through these hard times we'll work harder, harder
Give me hard times, I'll work harder, harder
For revolution hard time for some resolution

Stay blind to my future and fate
Start my traveling now

First came that dream to be seen
To know love, the world and all its stages

Now 25, I've made it alive
And what a life I have known, I'm gonna stop
Never fully grown, remember

I wont' fear what tomorrow may take
Stay blind to my future and fate
I wanna hear what the others may say
Let only love lead the way

Start my traveling now, traveling
I'm a traveler, I'm traveling

I see the redwoods, big deserts
Little brothers, my sisters, the music, the moments
I can never regret the cursed and blessed open road
Open road, open road, open road, open road

When all else fail remember always

Father, where is my gun?
Now that the war has begun
Oh, let me go it alone, I need no one
I said I need no one

But oh God, now here it comes
And it's too dark to aim this gun
Clicking now faster, faster, faster
Once again I'm on the run

And I hear you say, oh my stubborn son
Don't you said you need no one
But don't you see danger, danger, danger's
Headed to oblivion?

Followed the hunt far as I could
Through dozen weathers, petrified wood
And I took one shot in the dark
And fired the bullet silver to heart

And oh God, now here it comes
And it's too dark to aim this gun
Now faster, faster, faster
Once again I'm on the run

And I hear you say, oh my stubborn son
I know that you said you need no one
But don't you see danger, danger, danger
Headed to oblivion?
Oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion, oblivion

Wait a second, have you come so far for it to end like this?
This is the challenge
I dare you to take a hold of that darkness from deep down in you
Get back up, what are you so afraid of?

Show your face, face to me
Show your face, face to me
Be you my friend or enemy
Show your face, face to me

You'll be missed
Soon there'll be flowers in the river, tears been shed
You'll be missed, you'll be missed

See life has blessed you with a gift, boy
That you've gone and thrown away
And with it your whole future and left behind your family

They're throwing flowers in the river, prayers are being said
You are missed
They're throwing flowers in the river where your body cold was found
You are missed, missed

Now I sit down here at low tide and I wait for the peregrines
Stephen this is where I live now and I have overcome my demons
And I have grown out of that thinking that would not let me live or give

I throw my flowers in the river, the tears being shed
You are missed
And the poem reads and I remember the day
You told me that the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun is often out

Why didn't we know that the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun is often out
Wish I had known you better

How you gonna find your way out of the maze
Here the jealous hand of bitter men
Carve the meat before the table is laid

And they are hungry, they are hungry for you
And they are hungry, they are hungry for you
With an appetite so insatiable
They are hungry, they are hungry for you

The warm thread of love leads you to freedom
Once the hero's deed is done
You leave her lying without a parasol
In the slow solitaire sun

And she is hungry, she is hungry for you
And she is hungry, she is hungry for you
With an appetite so generous
She is hungry, she is hungry for you

No surrender to a lover
Or the wars of the news
Of many blisses to uncover
A black sail billows, the sun hits a blade

And you are hungry, you are hungry for you
And you are hungry, you are hungry for you
With an appetite so dangerous
You are hungry, you are hungry for you",Theseus

All along the river, heading fast as I could
Watch as the wasteland flowers
Old cars and rubbish flourish
The black berries and red berries
Sweet black berries, taste red berries

Went looking for my tower
Off all the rails and the roads
In need of resurrection
As my desires and power are growing in thickets
Tall all around me, tall and all around me
Tall around me, around, around, around now

Well, have I been traveling so long
That I've forgot how to stop?
Why are my breaks all broken?
Wheels spinning out of control
And then in the mirror, pale and deathly I have become

Well, what have I become? Mother?
What have I become? Become, become, become now

We looked at each other in the same way then

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me 

Kind woman, I give you my all

Tears of loves lost in the days gone by 
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die 
My, my, my inspiration is what you are to me 
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my world it smiles

Se en gnistra glimma starkt här inne,
Kom så springer vi längs vägen mot de blå,

Ska vi dansa hela natten lång,
Under en himmel som bär sommar färgen blå,

What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser
That made me smile

She was so shy - I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya
Was free and wild - and I mean wild!

Give me, give me one more chance

I'll keep you satisfied

You're my world, you're every breath I take
You're my world, you're every move I make
Other eyes see the stars up in the skies
But for me they shine within your eyes

As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you my love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine

You're my world, you are my night and day
You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
Then it's the end of my world for me

With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine

Il mio mondo finirÃ  con te
E Se tu mi lascerai

That's where they fell in love
When stars above
Came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
He kissed the smile
Upon her face
For it was ""Fiesta"" and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered ""ma'ana""
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered ""ma'ana""
For that tomorrow never came

South of the border, he rode back one day
There in a veil of white
By candlelight
She knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay

As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you

For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart

And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made him a slave to his wand'rin ways

If I could see the world
through the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be
There'd be no trouble and no strife
Just a big happy life
With a bluebird in every tree

[Chorus]
I could see right, no wrong
I could see good, no bad
I could see all the good things
In life I've never had
If I could see the world
through the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be

If I could see the world
through the eyes of a child
Smiling faces would greet me all the while
Like a lovely work of art
It would warm my weary heart
Just to see through the eyes of a child

[Chorus]

Patsy Cline,"I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hopin'you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight, searchin' for me",Walkin' After Midnight (1956 Version)

Oh stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' round n' round
I played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off

My heart is shattered can't you see
'Cause you no longer care for me
But someday I'm sure you'll see
Loving you did this to me

The one I love has let me down
I lost the wonder of his kiss
How could he leave me here like this

Patsy Cline,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.

Patsy Cline,"The first scene was the church, then the altar,
Where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried.
Our friends wished us luck there forever,
As we walked from the church, side by side.

The next scene was a crowded courtroom,
And like strangers we sat side by side.
Then I heard the judge make his decision,
And no longer were we man and wife.

I hate the sight of that courtroom,
Where man-made laws push God's laws aside.
Then the clerk wrote our story in the record ~
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye.

We walked from that courtroom together,
We shook hands and once again we cried.
Then it was the end of our story:
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye.","A Church, a Courtroom, and Then Goodbye"
Patsy Cline,"Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
If I had one wish, I wish I could
Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

I'd sing their praises long and loud
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'cause they all know they're a-doin' right
And the good lord's bound to have them for his own
If I'd go back to hear them pray
In the little pine church, they all would say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

When I was a child of only three
I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from god I'd never roam
When I get my summons on the judgment day
I hope I can hear my savior say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Patsy Cline,"Last night I dreamed
Of you, sweetheart
Once more you loved me
You said we`d never part

It`s dawn again
Oh, how sad am I
My dream has ended
And tears fill my eyes

Gently swaying around my feet
Like memories from the past

A dream that wouldn`t last

For once I know
Your promise you would keep
If I could only
Only stay asleep",If I Could Only Stay Asleep
Patsy Cline,"Never no more, will I be all alone

Never no more, will I try for him
`Cause I`ve got me somebody
Who makes me happy when I`m blue
I`ve been all around, a-paintin` the town
Saw the old faces and all the old places
That we use to know
But all that is past, got someone at last
Who makes me so happy that
Never no more, will I ever, never be blue
No never no more, will I ever see him
Never no more, now that I`m free of him

Who makes me happy when I`m blue

'Cause no one else will do

Say goodbye to the tear in your eye

That we could love again

My love and I, in a small cafe
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong

Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks, they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door and they'd all sing out
""Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home""

I'd sing their praises long and loud
'Cause they're all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
""Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home""

Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'Cause they all know they're a doin' right
And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own

In the little pine church, they all would say

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars, all alone

Well it was there I found, beside the Alamo
Enchantments strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass, that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon in all your splendor, known only to my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender, like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose, my rose of San Antone

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

And now as I wander - my thoughts ever stray

Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay
South of the border - Mexico way

Then she smiled as she whispered ""ma'ana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""ma'ana""

Then the clerk wrote our story in the record
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye.

We walked from that courtroom together,
We shook hands and once again we cried.

Then it was the end of our story,
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye.",A Church a Courtroom and Then Goodbye
Patsy Cline,"I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend

You want me to act
Like we've never kissed
You want me to forget
Pretend we've never met

And I try and I try
But I haven't yet
You walk by 
And I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the blame

",Love Sick Blues
Patsy Cline,"Titel is Dear God

I go to church on a Sunday
The vows I make
I break them on Monday
The rest of the week
I do as I please
Then come Sunday morning
I pray on my knees

Chourus:
Dear God I know I'm not Worthy
But I need you so please won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry dear god

Every week
We read in the paper
Of the carrings on
Of some our neighbors
Were lying and cheating
And forgeting our faith
Then we have the nerve
To ask is it to late

Tho' he's callous and cold
He may learn to give his heart for love
Instead of buyin' it with gold

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss

And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight
Is the hand I will hold?
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold

This ain't never been my home 
Sometimes the road was rocky long the way, boys 
But I was never travelin' alone 

We'll meet again on some bright highway 
Songs to sing and tales to tell 
But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
Until I see you fare thee well 

Ain't no need to cry for me, boys 
Somewhere down the road you'll understand 
Cause I expect to touch his hand, boys

Patterson Hood,"Used to be a killer
Best killer in the land
Killed women and children
Just as easy as a man

Leave their mangled bodies
Nonchalantly at the door
But now I ain't got the stomach
For killing any more

Made me lots of money
Was the best at my job
Never had to nine to five
Or cheat or steal or rob

Just load up my gun
And leave them on the floor
But now I've lost my taste
For killing any more

Something must be done
But it's all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through

She took me in her arms
When no one else would have me
Taught me how to throw the blade
And never let 'em have me

Taught me how to shoot so straight
Without a moments skill
She was the most beautiful thing
That I have ever killed

Something must be done
But it's all that I can do
What good is an assassin
Who just can't follow through

I used to be a killer
Murdered by the score
Now I just don't think
I can kill any more

Patterson Hood,"We've been good for each other
Held each other through so much
Now you're sittin' there givin' me that little look
Have to ask what that means

Comes a time for countin' losses
Time to take this left and go
I'll be gatherin' my belongings
I'll be walkin' out that door
I'll be walkin' out that door

Gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss me when I'm gone
I'll be sad, I won't be the only one
Gonna miss me when I'm gone

No use blamin' one another
Neither one of us to blame
Just picked a crazy time
To walk across each other's path
But I'm awful glad we came

Comes a time for countin' losses
Wish that time had not come
Two more things before I walk out that door
You're the best friend I've known

Patterson Hood,"Rising son, rising sun, beating down on me
I'm my daddy's rising son, world in front of me
But daddy, he ain't smilin' none, what could the problem be?
He just asys ""My foolish one, you live too dangerously""

But, daddy, I ain't hurtin' none, she's spread in front of me
I'd be a fool not to taste the pleasures offered me
But, daddy, he just turns away and locks it with a key
The thirty years years between us must have changed him bitterly

I took my money into town and spread it gingerly
Every table I laid it down, world in front of me
Wine and women, women, wine taste so honey sweet
Every pleasure, overwhelming knocks me off my feet

If anybody crossed my path, I'd cut them down to size
Self-righteousness and forward flow moved me to the prize
I stayed out drinking every night, toasting to the sunrise
I'm my daddy's rising son, won't he be surprised?

All the prophet prophesied my agonized defeat
All the men I trampled on, waited for my sleep
All the women I wronged, waited round with glee
For the big comeuppance that was waiting mad for me

It's the way of this mean world, things ain't really fair
The evil deal out from the bottom without a single care
The goodly try the best they can to hold to what is theirs
The sun, it rises one more day and I'm still standing here
",Rising Son
Patterson Hood,"Wrote you a love song on the back of a Bible
On the back of a Bible, a love song for you
And I ain't no authority about what it says in it
I can't even begin it
Page in the back is blank and waiting for you

Heard me a sad song on the way to a wedding
On the way to a wedding on the car radio
And I can't remember words to the verses
But I remember the chorus

And I can't remember who was marrying who
But I'm writing this love song for you

And I hate this motel room, they all smell the same
View of the parking lot etched in my brain
Stuck in this town and you're so far away

I ain't got no paper, I just got this pen
Rip out the back page and write you a hymn
Singing it to you again and again and again

Wrote you a love song on the back of a Bible
On the back of a Bible for you
Ain't no authority about what it says in it
I can't even begin it but I'm writing for you

Patterson Hood,"Last night I dreamt of a high school girl long legged and fine
And I took her from her daddy and she left her home behind
I was driving an old blue Belvedere, the seat was pushed way back
And she stared straight out the window as the trees went rushing by

Last night I dreamt of her underwear, the way she smelt in bed
And the way she tossed, way she squirmed
The dreams she might have had

And I think it's sad how her mom and dad don't ever understand
And I think it's sad how her friends all talk
I think it's sad how her friends all talk
I think it's sad how her friends all talk and the hateful things they say

Last night I dreamt of a high school girl, her smile was bright and wide
And I took her from her daddy and she left her smile behind
I was driving an old blue Belvedere, the seat was pushed way back
And she stared straight out the window and she ain't coming back
She ain't coming back

Patterson Hood,"Uncle Phil said to me that woman is the death of me
I don't think there's anything I can do
She's got ways I don't understand
Putting words into my mouth, things I can't get used to

But then she dropped the cornbread in the kitchen
Uncle Phil smiled as if she'd just done the greatest thing

I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now
I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now

My cousin screwed up without a doubt
All of a sudden he wasn't hanging out
And that girl he said, she is the cats
Then he disappeared from sight without a trace

So they had a bunch of babies and they got a good jobs
Working hard to provide the best they can

And I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now
Not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now

I'm starting to appreciate the value of generations changing hands
Family ties and lips and eyes pass it down, pass it down

Now the weatherman today said
Warm and cloudy, cold front coming in around sundown
And I'm walking through your house full of your beautiful relations
And I'm thinking that I'd like to stick around

And there are things I have said with one hand on the Bible
That are only now starting to make sense

I'm not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now
Not sure if I understood then
But I guarantee I understand now
I understand now, I understand now

Patterson Hood,"I killed Oscar, shot him in the head
Put the gun in his mouth, watched his brains fly out
My worries fade as the hole got bigger
Solved all my problems with a trigger

I don't need forgiveness for my sins
I don't need redemption for my sins
Got the satisfaction of a job well done
With my own bare hands

Oscar, Oscar was destroying me
I killed Oscar, burden lifted off of me
I killed Oscar now I'm happy, happy, happy
I killed Oscar before he killed me
I killed Oscar before he killed me

I don't need forgiveness for my sins
I don't need redemption for my sins
I don't need salvation 'cause I saved myself
I don't need your help because I helped myself
I don't need nobody trying to save, save, save me

She's brought back souvenirs from every vacation
Said don't look now, doll your neurosis' are showing
I tried to compliment her nose but she could tell that mine was growing

Pollyanna does not live here

Thought about the way things change and how she used to be
Guess I wanted that girl again, guess it wasn't meant to be
She had a warmth about her that could not melt an ice cube
If I could go back in time I'd bring you back a Quaalude

Pollyanna does not live here
Pollyanna does not live here
Pollyanna has moved far, far away
Pollyanna has moved far, far away

The bed got sticky, the floor got sticky
The kitchen table went crashing down
I was sticky and she was sticky
Too bad she could not stick around

And everything sticks to her like glue
But I'm just something she's got stuck to the bottom of her shoe
And when she's through with me I guess I'll follow through
And wait for something new to stick to

Patterson Hood,"Your daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothing can keep us out of this battle
They wage as it burns up the plains till no one is left in the saddle

Your ranch is upstream and they've dammed up the water
Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter
The sheep while your daddy's asleep and I'll do the same for his daughter

If I had my way we would be together back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad bringing grief upon a poor old farmer's house
But we ain't got nowhere left to go

Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worse
If you'd married me first there would not have been any range war
You would not have been lost to this range war

Patterson Hood,"I'm your knight in shining armor
You don't have to work that job anymore
Buy a house in the burbs, two-car garage
Shrubberies and a birdbath

Keep you safe warm and dry
Keep the tears from your eyes
Keep you pregnant all the time

Name them Skip, Paul and George
Maybe even have a girl
We'll name her after mom

Come on baby take my hand
SUV or minivan?
Keep you happy and sedated
Who needs to be liberated?
You've got me, you've got me

If you got something in your head
Makes you think there's something else
Maybe the doctor can give you
Something to make you forget

Promise I will hold you tight
I will make you scream all night
Bills will get paid on time
The birthday poem I write you will rhyme
Son here's a loaded gun, try not to hurt no one

You were with my friend Clyde
He was my best friend till they
Pulled his face out of the dashboard
And I always thought you were too good for him

Let me take you for a spin
I'll take you home, I'll take you home
And everything will be just fine

Patterson Hood,"She's a little randy for something she ain't got
Man a little handy, this summer sure is hot
Maybe fix some ice tea or lemonade
She's a little randy for some fanning in the shade

She's a little randy hoping this ain't all
Like when he used to put his hands around her waist like a football
Now his hands ain't there at all, she's a little cold
She's a little randy for something to take hold

He used to take his hat off like her favorite movie star
Now it covers up a bald spot like her favorite country star
She can still remember the way it used to be
She's a little randy for something more then he

She's a little randy for something she ain't got
Man a little handy, this summer sure is hot
So she pours herself a brandy and smokes a little pot
She's a little randy, she's a little randy
She's a little randy, but then again who's not?

There’s no way that the stars can refuse

Hungry for the tender and the warm

Into heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt 
Finding another world

What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on?

Patti Austin,"Oh, I can cook, too, on top of the rest, 
My seafood's the best in the town. 
And I can cook, too. 
My fish can't be beat, 
My sugar's the sweetest around. 
I'm a man's ideal of a perfect meal 
Right down to the demi-tasse. 
I'm a pot of joy for a hungry boy, 
Baby, I'm cookin' with gas. 
Oh, I'm a gumdrop, 
A sweet lollipop, 
A brook trout right out of the brook, 
And what's more, baby, I can cook!

Some girls keep house on a dime, 
Some girls make wonderful lovers,

I'd make a magazine cover, 
I do keep house on a dime, 
I make a wonderful lover, 
I should be paid overtime! 

'Cause I can bake, too, on top of the lot, 
My oven's the hottest you'll find. 
Yes, I can roast too, 
My chickens just ooze, 
My gravy will lose you your mind. 
I'm a brand new note 
On a table d'hôte, 
But just try me à la carte. 
With a single course 
You can choke a horse. 
Baby, you won't know where to start! 
Oh, I'm an hors d'oeuvre, 
A jelly preserve, 
Not in the recipe book, 
And what's more, baby, I can cook!

Some girls can hit a high ""C"", 
Some girls make good taxi drivers, 
But what a genius is me. 
I'd make a wonderful jiver, 
I even hit a high ""C"", 
I make the best taxi driver, 
I rate a big Navy ""E""! 

'Cause I can fry, too, on top of the heap, 
My Crisco's as deep as a pool. 
Yes, I can broil, too, 
My ribs get applause, 
My lamb chops will cause you to drool. 
For a candied sweet 
Or a pickled beet, 
Step up to my smorgasbord. 
Walk around until 
You get your fill. 
Baby, you won't ever be bored! 
Oh, I'm a paté, 
A marron glacé, 
A dish you will wish you had took. 
And what's more, baby, I can cook!!

Patti Austin,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view,
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me
",Lazy Afternoon
Patti Austin,"VERSE:
The sky may be starless,
The night may be moonless,
But deep in my heart there's a glow.
For deep in my heart
I know that you love me.
You love me because you told me so.

CHORUS:
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart.
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write.

*I memorize ev'ry line,
I kiss the name that you sign.
And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart.

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

My true love was true
Oh, I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied 

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
Oh, when your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

When a lovely flame dies

Patti Austin,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Old Man Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most


",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most
Patti Austin,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no, they can't take that away from me

I looked at the moon and I felt blue
Then I looked again and I saw you
Eyes like fire in the night
Bridges burning with their light
Now I want to spend the whole night through
And Honey, Yes, I'd like to spend it all on you

Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way

They might fade and turn to stone
Let's get crazy all alone
Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there
After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore

Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me, would you

Patti Austin,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me
Patti Austin,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Patti Austin,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah,
The weather there is nice and warm!
The climates of a Southern brand,
But here's what I don't understand:
They got a gal there, a pretty gal there,
Who's colder than an Arctic storm,
Got a heart just like a stone,
Even ice men leave her alone!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher,
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan,
There was Hannah pouring water on a drowning man!
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

They call her Hard Hearted Hannah,
The vamp of Savannah,
The meanest gal in town;
Talk of your cold, refrigeratin' mamas,
Brother, she's a polar bear's pajamas!
To tease 'em, and thrill 'em, to torture and kill 'em,
Is her delight, they say,
An evening spent with Hannah sittin' on your knees,
Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDs.
She's Hard Hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah, GA!

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah
She's got the right name, The vamp of Savannah
Any time a woman can take a great big pan
And start pouring water on a drownin' man
She's hard hearted Hannah

Ohh she's sweet as sour milk","Hard Hearted Hannah, (The Vamp of Savannah)"

And of course Prince Charming is the theme

It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone, madam, 
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray, 
And from under her velvet gown, 
She drew a gun and shot her love down, madam,

When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail, madam, 
They strung her upon the old willow across the way,

‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'

What have you up your sleeve?

And if you can't spring it, you simply have to

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan
Patti Dunham,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended
Patti Hall,"If you had the real thing how would you tell
Liars can say it all just as well
Every single word you've heard in vain
Baubles of gold, stars in your hair
Reflections that told that they were not there
And the diamonds on your cheeks have turned to flames

[Chorus]
And up in the air they would write your name there
But love would fall to pieces in the rain
Who would know better than you
A hundred love letters and none of them true

Christina, Christina

It's a wondrous world of ridiculous things
With nothing so rare as the love that it brings
In the silence of a smile that understands
A piece of the action, pieces of gold
Everyone's paid well and does what they're told
For the simple daughter of a simple man

[Chorus]

Christina, Christina
Christina, Christina",Christina
Patti Holladay,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Patti Holladay,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?
Patti Holladay,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When

You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

You know it's over
We're just goin' through the motions
But we're sailing separate oceans, worlds apart
And you know it's breakin' my heart

You were a dreamer
But perfection is consuming
And it seems we're only human after all
And we've both been takin' the fall

But tomorrow
We'll run a little bit faster
Tomorrow
We're gonna find what we're after at last
Feelings that we left in the past
There's romance in the sunset
We're boats against the current to the end

Maybe we're older
And maybe we're colder
So we disregard solutions
While we cling to our illusions once again
And we keep remembering when
Seasons are changing
Oh my reasons are changing
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
And the years keep slipping away

Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over 
The hill and stream
Look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow the fellow
Who follows a dream

It was sumptuous gift
To give to a child
Oh, the lure of that song
Kept me running wild
Never grow old
And stand still
With whipper wheels singing 
Beyond the next hill

Oh look
Look
Look to the rainbow
Follow it over

Follow the fellow 
Who follows a dream

So I bundled my heart
And I roamed the world free
To the east with a long 
To the west with a sea
And I searched all the earth
And I scanned all the skies
But I found it at last
In my own true love's eyes

You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

After all of us told her, ?No?
S-s-she'd get another spoon ball
Now, she's going no where slow

Her papa caught her for the first time
And put her out on the street
Cara told me to remind him
That she was only seventeen

Yo, mister how's your daughter? how's your girl?
You really ought to know
Every thing you taught her
It don't matter when she's all alone

Cara got hooked up with the wrong kids
Then s-s-she started skipping school
Then Cara got high to make disappear
A world full of fools

In her eyes her father was the biggest fool of them all
And she was speeding, that's what she?d say
Maybe, maybe, maybe she wouldn't talk so stupid
If she knew how much she needed this fool today

Yo, mister how's your daughter?
You really ought to know
For every thing you taught her
Don't matter when she's all alone

She needs you right now mister
?Cause she ain't got long to live
It?s so easy to say, ?I love you?
But it?s harder to forgive

Her father cried when I told him that Cara twice got knocked up
He said, ?Just like her mama, aha, she shows her body
When she wants to show love, she tried that stuff with me
And I beat her down, there's no way I could let her stay
Couldn't let her stick around ?

?Cause I tried so hard to raise her right
He said, ?What made her turn out this way?, I don't know
What made her turn out this way, I don't know, I don't know
And I said and I said and I said

You really ought to know, every thing

Don't matter when she's all alone

He said, ""I love you baby, you're the best I ever knew
But I'm not ready for anyone like you
This is as far as it goes and as close as it gets""
He said, ""You sure sing pretty but I don't do duets""

He walked in the room and all he had to do was smile
Waitin' in his arms, a fool would have known was a danger zone
His talk was so sweet but let there be no doubt
While I was movin' in, he was movin' out

He said, ""I love you baby, you're the best I ever knew
But I'm not ready for anyone like you
This is as far as it goes and as close as it gets""
He said, ""You sure sing pretty but I don't do duets""

Said I wish that I could lose my mind
For the faithful, ready, steady kind
He's out there singin' on his own
And like me, he's tired of doin' it alone, oh yes he is

I did it again, I always make the same mistake
When it comes to men I fall for the guys with the bedroom eyes
It starts out great but before too long
Mr. Right turns out to be Mr. Wrong

Enough of, ""I love you baby, you're the best I ever knew
No more, ""I'm not ready for anyone like you""
Not gonna fall for those lines, the lies and regrets
Not gonna sing so pretty, if he don't do duets

I don't wanna make the same mistake again

Not gonna sing so pretty, if he don't do duets
Not gonna sing so pretty, if he don't do duets
Not gonna sing so pretty, if he don't do duets
Not gonna sing so pretty, if he don't do duets

I, I hear your voice
I, I hear your voice
I, I hear your voice calling in the night
(Can't take it, baby)
I

I remember just like it was yesterday
I woke up, baby, you were gone
Didn't even wanna tear myself up out of bed
Let alone, I didn't wanna carry on

'Cause I could hear your voice
(I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it no matter how hard I try
I can hear your sound, your sound
(I hear your sound calling in the dark)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die

I started looking, looking from dusk till dawn
For ways that I wouldn't miss you so much
I even brought a new dress but when I put it on
I could still, still feel your touch

And I can hear your voice
(I hear your voice calling in the night)
I can't stop it no matter how hard I try
I can hear your sound, your sound, your sound
(I hear your sound calling in the dark)
In a word, I feel like I wanna die

My friends tell me, they say Patti find a new love
A bird in hand beats two in the bush
What my friends don't know and I ain't about to tell them
Is that you're the only one, you're the only one
That knows what buttons to push

Oh oh, it don't take no scientist to tell you what's wrong with me
No no no, it don't take good vision to see what any fool could see
That I just need your body, I just need your fa-fa-face
Right where it counts, no not in another place
I'm talkin' about all up, hey, and all down

Every inch you see, I don't need to cross town
You better read my lips, I need you here with me
I can't stop it, no matter how I try
In a word, I feel like I wanna die

I hear your voice
I, I hear your voice
I, I hear your voice

Patti LaBelle,"Here we are, just going through the motions one more time
You look into my eyes but you don't see me
And here I am, feeling like a stranger in your arms
I touch you, I hold you but lately I don't know you

Something is wrong but we go on from day to day
And we just pretend it all away
We act like nothing's changed
But in our hearts we know, it's not the same, oh, no

'Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright
But we're not makin' love

Remember when you couldn't wait to run into my arms
When the love inside my heart was all you needed
Remember when you made me wish the night would never end
The fire, the thunder, we lived to love each other

If ever two hearts were one, then it was yours and mine
But that was another place in time
Now all we have to show
Are memories of a dream we used to know

'Cause we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright
But we're not makin' love

When did we lose our way? We had it all
Don't know how it all just slipped away
But oh, can we get it back again?
Is it too late? Can we try just one time?

'Cause darling, we're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
We may hold each other tight
Say that everything's alright

We're not makin' love anymore
Baby, we're not makin' love like before
Can we find a way to try?
Find the magic one more time

Afraid when I can't save it all

I'm saving it, you've got to keep

A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
I'm saving my love for you

When we're, our two
And I felt that I've known you for so long
One thing, I knew
It was lovin' that would last on and on

Even with the best of plans
The world gets in the way
Don't be downhearted
I'll soon be back to stay

And it's waiting there for you and me

Each star's a pool of water, cool water
But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water, cool, clear, water

Tonight we pray for water, cool, water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Patti LaBelle,"It must have been cold there in my shadow 
To never have sunlight on your face 
You were content to let me shine, that's your way 
You always walked a step behind 
So I was the one with all the glory 
While you were the one with all the strength. 
A beautiful face without a name, for so long 
A beautiful smile to hide the pain 

Did you ever know that you're my hero 
And everything I would like to be 
If I can fly higher than an eagle 
You are the wind beneath my wings 
It might have appeared to go unnoticed 
But I've got it all here in my heart 
I want you to know I know the truth 
Of course I know it 
I would be nothing with out you 

Fly, fly, fly away 
You let me fly so high 
Oh, fly, fly 
So high against the sky 
So high I almost touch the sky 
Thank you, thank you, thank God for you 
The wind beneath my wings",Wind Beneath My Wings
Patti LaBelle,"In a world of superheros, in a world of weak and strong
In a sea of have and have nots, I've survived the raging storm
And I pray for a world where we all can be free
It's a heavenly vision, it's a garden that I see
It's a joy that graced the heart of loving me

When you've been blessed, feels like heaven
When you've been blessed, feels like heaven, heaven

I have faith, I have hope and I trust in the day
When the music from heaven will show us the way
It's a garden of music, it's a garden of love
And we are all his children sharing gifts from above

When you've been blessed, feels like heaven, heaven
When you've been blessed, pass it on, pass it on

Patti LaBelle,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.

Never stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Never
Stopped loving you
Done a lot of things
In my life 
And at times
I found the answers 
To some questions
That were heavy on my mind
Every fantasy
Ceased to be a mystery
To me
Done a lot of things
That I have lived to regret
But all the moves I made
Were not enough
To help me forget
In solitude I find
Your kiss stays on my mind
After all this time

(Chorus)
I never stopped loving you
I only did what I had to do
Though we've been 
So far apart
You kept your
Place in my heart
I never stopped loving you
Shared a part of me with you
I let you touch
That secret space 
Inside my hungry heart
That couldn't get enough
I just can't forget
What was so perfect

In you:
Your scent
Your touch
Your kiss
Your everything
Stays burned in my memory
And it keeps me yearning
To share some smiles again
Like we did back then
My old friend

(Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus)

And God only knows
Just how far I would go
To get back together
With you

When it's kissed
By early
Morning's dew
I ain't gonna do it
Cause I can't get through it, no

To fill my life with the joy I have dreamed of
And warm my nights like the morning sun

Finally
I've found someone for me

That I'm living my fantasy

Cause I was so afraid
I'd messed it up by exposing my emotions
Scared I'd be giving it all away
Since I've surrendered my heart to you darling
I haven't been the same
Because of you my whole life has come together 
Your tender kiss has erased the pain

When you can't find your way,
I'll move mountains for you,
If you just ask me to,
Baby let me do something for you,
I'm on your side,
Anytime day or night,
Love is just a whisper away,
No need to shout,
That ain't what it's about,
Love is just a whisper away",Love Is Just a Whisper Away
Patti LaBelle,"Ooh, baby, ah

Sorry to disturb you
But I had to get this off my chest
I know you've been real busy
Don't have time for emotional stress

You see, taking care of home
Means more than just the rent
It means calling now and then
On occasions dropping in
And sometimes having flowers sent

What if I stayed out late
And didn't even call
Wasn't there to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?
Still, what would you do?

Oh, I, I think you take for granted
That I'm always gonna be here
This is your final notice
Soon I'm gonna disappear

I'm not asking for a whole lot
Just think of me now and then
If you don't know what I'm saying
I don't know how this love can win

And didn't even call
Wasn't there to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
Tell me what would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?

Well, you should do unto others
As you would have them do to you
You reap what you sow and that's how it goes
So be careful what you do
Telling you ain't no good gonna come to you

If I stayed out late and didn't even call
There to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
What would you do
If the shoe was on the other foot?

I stayed out late
And didn't even call
There to pick you up
Whenever you fall

If I didn't smile
And compliment you when I should
What would you do
The shoe was on the other foot

Tell me, tell me what would you do
If you had to, tell me
If you had to do like I do sometimes",Shoe Was on the Other Foot
Patti LaBelle,"All my life
I've waited
For someone
Like you
With a heart of gold
Yes, hey yes
I, I always knew
I knew
You would come my way, hey

All my life, yes
I've waited [Repeat x 2]
For someone like you

I've waited a lifetime, 
For someone just like you, 
Somebody who will take my hand,
Someone who's warm and true,
Romancing by candlelight,
A touch from you thrills my heart,
Say if you love me and you feel right,
Nothing can keep us apart,

All my life I've waited for someone like you,
With a heart of gold,
I always knew you would come my way,
All my life I've waited for some like you,

From now 'til the end of the time,
That's how long I'll be loving you,
Together we will live in paradise,
A paradise made for two,
All my prayers have been answered,
Yes indeed
And my dreams are reality,
I feel complete whenever you're next to me, 
So I'm gonna hold on, 
I'll never let go, no, no,

[Chorus]

Everyday we'll make sunshine,
Every night like a first time,
Anything that's on your sweet mind,
I'll make it happen for you and only you,
For you I'll do anything
Just keep it real
And I'll do the same
'Cause I love you
Ain't no shame I my game,
All my life I waited for you.

This is just a test, tell me
What do you know about love
This is just a test, it ain't your life
Tell me

I'd like to give you a test
So darling, prepare yourself
When I say 'Love', please explain
What pictures pop in your brain

Cause when you talk about love
Say when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

Now if you need to be taught
Don't make me an after thought
For every lesson that's wrong
You can bet my good loving will be gone

So let's erase any doubt
Take a second or two to figure out
Speak from your lips to my ears
Yes, I know you know what I wanna hear

When you talk about love
When you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

No, I'm not gonna play tit for tat
When it comes to affairs of the heart
But if I love you, I want love back
And I know that I love you so just do your part

When you talk about love
I said, when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

So when you talk about love
When you think about love
So when you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

And I feel your breath so soft against my cheek
All my fears just disappear in darkness
And I know for sure
That I could never leave

You are the strength that I found to see
You lift me up when I'm down loving me
When I never thought
That I'd feel my heart come around
You are my solid ground

I don' t need a fairy tale to save me
I've got all the magic I need in your arms
And I won't even fly away in madness
I'll stay close enough to always feel your warmth

When drowning in a lonely sea
You reached out and rescued me
You saved my life

In my darkest night
You, you are my shelter
In the storm

You saved my life
When all around was sinking sand
You were there with outstreched hands
You saved my life

With love
You saved my life
With nothing to gain
You bared my pain

From the start
You showed me love from the heart
When all else fails

Patti LaBelle,"The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

Patti LaBelle,"It came upon a midnight clear that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heaven all gracious 
King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels 
sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings 
unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Patti LaBelle,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

Patti LaBelle,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

In the lane, snow is glistening

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird

As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,

Come with me tonight
Share my dream
Change my life and

Make tonight beautiful

Than any night I've ever known
In my life before

Lay with me and stay with me tonight
Make tonight a beautiful night

Turn the lights down, tune the world out?
There's a world of love waiting there for us
Let me take you to a place you've
Never been before open up a door

To a dream come true
Take my hand
And show me how to

Make tonight beautiful

With the first snowflakes of winter
My heart goes straight back home
To the days when I was little before life on my own

Nothing could be better than the Christmas here with you
Family joined together, loved ones old and new
As we gather here, the season's cheer
Makes my yuletide wish come true
Nothing could be better than Christmas here with you

Christmas Eve is special, it's music to my ears
Singing 'round the fire, we chose the coming year
Carols in the distance, faces full of joy
It's a Merry Christmas, in wonder we rejoice

Nothing could be better than Christmas here with you

As I gaze at the Christmas tree
The light shining back at me
Makes me glad for the times we spent
So I'm myself being thankful for these moments
Moments in our life

Nothing could be better than the Christmas here with you
Family joined together, loved ones old and new
As we gather here, the season's cheer
Makes my yuletide wish come true
Nothing could be better than Christmas here with you",Nothing Could Be Better
Patti LaBelle,"Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?

If we can love each other
Realize we're sisters and brothers
Take care of our babies
Teach them to respect one another

Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?

If the nations of the world could start a peace
We'll have no more war
If the Christian, Muslim, Jew
Could learn to love each other too

Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?
Wouldn't it be beautiful?

Wouldn't it be beautiful?

Oh, if people stop bombing the planes
Stop hurting all these innocent people
The communist, Catholics too
Could learn to love each other too

Patti LaBelle,"Raindrops on my window seal
Its quiet as a mouse in here
You're somewhere with the girls doing nails
Dinners takeout, no home cooking all year
Ain't no use pretending (no,no)
Cause perfect I know I have not been
But there's gotta be a way to work things out
Twenty years, should remove all doubt

{Chorus]
Ronald Isley: If you love me,(I love you) then how could you go
Patti Labelle: It's not about the love, its just I've had enough maybe we need to let it go
Ronald Isley: If you ever loved me,(I love you baby) then how could you leave
Patti Labelle: some songs have gotta end,we're better off as friend maybe its time I go solo

I know this is confusing to you
But its been coming for a mighty long time
A woman needs to be loved
Enter too body, soul, and mind
You've been taking me for granted
No surprises, no flowers on rainy days
Now I can keep you just the way you are
But I know some things will never change

It's a new day

Made the same mistakes
Over and again

For the illusion to end

For every door that shuts
Another opens
Takin' a chance I'm gonna win
Can't go back where I've been

Patti LaBelle,"Here you come, walking my way
So much inside me
I wanna say, I've been holding on
For the longest, longest time

And I finally got the nerve
To tell you how I feel about you, the nerve
I can't live without you
The nerve to tell you what's been on my mind for a lifetime

And I finally got the nerve
I found the words to say, I've got the nerve
Can't wait another day, I've got the nerve
Don't wanna lose it this time

I'm trying to make
Tryin' to make a connection
But I'm afraid that there might be rejection on your part
It would break my heart in a million pieces

Can't go through it
(Through it)
Another day
I gotta let you know, I feel this way about you, baby
I dream about you in my life

And I finally got the nerve
To tell you how I feel about you, the nerve
I can't live without you, the nerve
I got the nerve to tell you what's been on my mind for a lifetime

When you walk by, my heart skips a beat
I contemplate the thought of you and me
I get weak for you
I can't get you off of my mind

I know I got to
(Got to)
Got to keep it real
'Cause you know how, you know how I feel
I'm wanting you and I'm needing you every day

And I finally got the nerve
To tell you how I feel about you, the nerve
I've got the nerve, the nerve
I've got the nerve to tell you what's been on my mind for a lifetime

And to recognize my pain
You block my journey
You mock my tears
Tell me why
I spoke for us, for we
But now there's just silence

For a brighter day
I hope to see you again
For a brighter day

You're a woman now, and it's time for you
Time you grow up and learn your way
Make this house a home, and make sure he knows
You're the one he can count on

To a day I only shop for me
Don't get mad if I buy the clothes

Love me by what my heart shows
But it seems like you just can't let it go

You keep talking bout my clothes
But the clothes don't make the woman
You keep talking bout my hair

Don't get mad if you see me

Patti LaBelle,"Make it easy on yourself
Darling, [Incomprehensible]

I used to think that we were always gonna be in love
But I was so naive back then I wasn't wise enough
To know there ain't nothing in this life that's guaranteed
You take your chances when you let your heart lead

And heaven knows how much I wanted to keep loving you
You let me down when you said some things that were untrue
So I'm giving you up 'cause there ain't enough love in this world
To change my mind, we're out of time, the dream is over

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

We could go on forever never really letting go
What's the sense in that when in our hearts we knew
This isn't working, we're on a dead end road
Don't think my back can stand the weight of the load

And while it's hard for me to admit we made a mistake
I can't pretend no more, it's too much to take
Time for moving on, I said all I have to say
Won't live a lie, this is goodbye, the dream is over now

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

And as I walk away though I'm leaving with tears and regrets
There are memories of you I will never forget
But it's time for me to do what my heart tells me to
I have to be strong but right or wrong, I'll always love you

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal
My honest emotions, truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just got to be real

I've got my reasons for the way that I feel
Suffered in silence when I had to conceal

So much is already understood

You're mine I wouldn't deny it's true

Want you so much
There's something you gotta know

[Chorus]
I want something more
More than a dream
More than a wish
More than a vision
I'm lookin' for more
More than just words
More than a promise
More than a feeling
I want something more
It's got to be more

You said that you're taking your time
But I wonder
In the end will you be mine
You're sweet, I crave your touch

We make good love
But sometimes that's not enough
Even though you're good to me
And another woman would settle for less
There's something I must confess

Patti LaBelle,"When you love someone like you do
There's no in between, not for you
You give him everything that you got
You love him all the way or not
When you love someone it just hurts
When you've done everything to make it work
So when everything's not enough
Maybe he's just not the one

[Chorus:]
Sometimes love walks away
Sometimes love has to change
Sometimes the heart has to break
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
Sometimes love's not the way
That you thought it would be
Sometimes you just got to leave
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
When you love someone it's natural
To have second thoughts, should you go
It's not easy girl, being strong
You keep wondering if you were wrong
But don't you fall for that it's a game
The trying to make you feel you're to blame
To protect your heart there's no shame
You know better girl walk away

[Chorus]",Sometimes Love

Life is unpredictable
You could be here today, and gone tomorrow
Why waste precious time
When all we need to find is the love inside
It's up to us to make a better way
We have to change our hearts to heal the world today
Don't cost you nothing but a smile
To make somebody's life feel worthwhile

I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song

I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

I'm waiting
Ooh, still waiting
I'm just a fool
Ooh, I'm a fool
To keep waiting

Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

You filled my life with empty space

Stop wasting time and start embracing
His light and let it shine

Count your blessings when they say
Oh it ain't no way but what matters
Never stop believing in yourself
But in the Lord God and you'll see
All the answers that free you from change
That would seem to keep you standing still

Been giving, God's been giving position

You can leave them all behind you

One that simply says
You can't miss what you never had

I thought that love was just a feeling
That I'd give to him and in return
He'd give it back

But it's more than a friendly sensation
Oh, I had to be tripping out on the girls
Body vibration

But I knew, oh, oh, oh yeah

Just like a tender young virgin
In her first love affair
I doubt if she'd ever do it again
Would she even care?

But as time pressed on
Ooh, ooh, the girl caught on
Nothing more she'd do with the boy
She seemed to want it, want it, want it

But there's one side of love
I'd never, never, never known
Baby, until you came along
I can, I can tell the world

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Break it down to me easy
'Cause everybody needs some kind
Of love in their life
Some kind of shape, form or fashion

Some kind of shape, form or fashion
Oh, and just like the flowers need the rain
And they need, they need love to grow

I got you, baby
That's all you'll ever need
Chased away the blues in my life
You've got a way of making everything alright

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Somebody, understand me now

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no

When something happen good to you
Seem like you just wanna
Let everybody know, let everybody know

And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back

Patti LaBelle,"I don't know how love could do this to me
I've waited and waited for someone I never see
But I'm so sentimental, and I'm so hopeful you'll be there
So, here I am every year, every Christmas

I've wished for you in my heart and in my head
And I got my answer that first moment that we met
And, oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said
You'd be here every year, every Christmas

There must be a lesson for me to learn
If you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return
Why should I be lonely, don't tell me it's right
I have my pride, but I'd rather be with you tonight

So much emotion, it's driving me mad
But I'll take my chances with these feelings that I have
And I'll come back to this same corner where we met
And I'll be here every year, every Christmas

Mere words can't explain the pain and the fear
'Cause oh, I wonder, yes, I wonder are you gonna leave me standing here
Today's almost over, but I don't want to leave
Has my heart made a fool out of me?

My friends gather round me with holiday cheer
They say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here
Well, I can't keep explaining what they'll never understand
And why I'm here every year, every Christmas

Oh, but all those material things
It was just false happiness

So I learned not to put love

Should always be free

Patti Lewis,"And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, What's his is hers

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
The walls begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

I'm falling into you
This dream could come true
And it feels so good falling into you

Falling like a leaf, falling like a star
Finding a belief, falling where you are

Catch me, don't let me drop!
Love me, don't ever stop!

So close your eyes and let me kiss you
And while you sleep I will miss you

And it feels so good falling into you

Finding a belief, falling where you are

Patti LuPone,"Times have changed,
And we've ofter rewound the clock
Since the puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth rock
If today any shock they might try to stem
'stead of landing of Plymouth rock
Plymouth rock would land on them.

In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now God knows
Anything goes

Good authors to
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why nobody will oppose

When every night
The set that's smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose
Anything goes

When Rockefeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And days night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once owned several chateaux

When folks
Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's
Lack baby clo'es
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes

Patti LuPone,"There was a time when men were kind
Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So diff'rent from this hell I'm living
So diff'rent now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream
Patti LuPone,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales
Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.
Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.
I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too",Lush Life
Patti LuPone,"When I was a girl l I had a favorite story 
Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind 
Her voice could match the angels' in its glory 
But she was blind, the lark was blind
An old king came and took her to his palace 
Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid 
And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice 
And he prayed: 

""Sing for me, my meadowlark, 
Sing for me of the silver morning,
Set me free, my meadowlark, 
And I'll buy you a priceless jewel 
And cloth of brocade and crewel 
And I'll love you for life, 
If you will sing for me.""

Then one day as the lark sang by the water 
The god of the sun heard her in his flight 
And her singing moved him so 
He came and brought her the gift of sight
He gave her sight 
And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor 
Of this beautiful, young god, so proud and strong
And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender
""Come along. 
Fly with me, my meadowlark,
Fly with me on the silver morning,
Past the sea where the dolphins bark
We will dance on the coral beaches,
Make a feast of the plums and peaches 
Just as far as your vision reaches 
Fly with me.""

But the meadowlark said no
For the old king loved her so 
She couldn't bear to wound his pride
So the sun god flew away 
And when the king came down that day 
He found his meadowlark had died
Every time I heard that part I cried 

And now I stand here starry-eyed and stormy 
Oh, just when I thought my heart was finally numb 
A beautiful, young man appears before me, 
Singing â??come, oh, won't you come?â??
And what can I do if finally for the first time 
The one I'm burning for returns the glow? 
If love has come at last it's picked the worst time
Still I know
I've got to go

Fly away, meadowlark 
Fly away in the silver morning, 
If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark 
So it's off where the days won't bind me 
I know I leave wounds behind me 
But I won't let tomorrow find me 
Back this way 
Before my past once again can blind me 
Fly away
And we won't wait 
To say good-bye 
My beautiful young man 
And I.",Meadowlark

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Patti Mckinnon,"When the postman delivered a letter
It filled her dear heart full of joy
But she didn't know till she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
Dear Mom, was the way that it started
I miss you so much it went on
Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won
I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet
The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darling had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free",Soldiers Last Letter
Patti Mckinnon,"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean,
But you don't care how many tears I cry

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you,
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Someday you'll find someone you really care for
And if her love should prove to be untrue,
You'll know how much this heart of my is breakin'

Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon

That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

And you've forgot the rules of love that life has always taught
And if you broke as many hearts as ripples in a stream
Well, brother, here's the only way that you can be redeemed

[Chorus]
Cross over the bridge, cross over the bridge
Change your reckless way o'livin', cross over the bridge
Leave you fickle past behind you and true romance will find you
Brother, cross over the bridge

If you have built a boat to take you to the greener side
And if that boat is built of ev'ry lie you ever lied
You'll never reach the Promised Land of love, I guarantee
Cause lies cannot hold water and you'll sink into the sea

[Chorus]

I know it isn't easy to resist temptation's call
But think of how your broken heart will hurt you when you fall
Cause some day you will find that you are hopelessly in love
And she'll belong to someone else as sure as stars above

And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can

I hadn't seen Jim in years.
He'd been reported dead.
Though Jim was my true love,
I soon would marry Fred.
The wedding march was beginning
When Jim appeared that day.
With a cry, I ran to him,
But they all heard Jim say

Let me be forgotten,
Or just a memory.
I'll love you, dear, always,

I stood there, torn between two loves,
My Fred and my Jim.
Jim was gone for so long,
Yet I knew I still loved him.
But then Fred showed his true love;
He wouldn't stand in our way.
He placed my hand in Jim's,
And they all heard

He may learn to give his heart for love,
Instead of buying it with gold.

And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss.

Is the hand I will hold.

Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.

Patti Page,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

But nevertheless, why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit
The sleepless nights I've had about the boy

On the silver screen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there
Are traces of the cad, about the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the fury of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy?
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

Patti Page,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

As I walked out on Laredo one day,
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen,
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by.
""Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story.
""I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die.""

""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing.
""Once in the saddle, I used to go gay.
""First to the card-house and then down to Rose's.
""But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin.
""Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
""Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
""Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.""

""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly.
""Play the dead march as you carry me along.
""Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,
""I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother,
""An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
""But please not one word of the man who had killed me.
""Don't mention his name and his name will pass on.""

When thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting.
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay.
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley,
And there stands his marker, we made, to this day.

I put it under lock and key,

And you linger like a haunting refrain

Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys

Then I tumble out of paradise

Just to change the mood I'm in

Or will I grow to hate you, like all the other ones?

Is the way you walk right past me

Just awakened at the minute

Out on me

All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.

Little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him, the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human.

But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,
I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it, where I am not human.

I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
And he put up his hands and he said, ""It's me, it's me,
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Don't leave me here!""
The sun, the sign, the cross,
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohamed Boxer
Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human, we're not human.

Well, there was sand, there were tiles,
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And he saw, raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,

Patti Smith,"Car stopped in a clearing,
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening.
Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me.

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, take me please!

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.

So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.
Break it up, break it up, break it up,

Patti Smith,"Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel, that sent you away
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Called you on the phone, another dimension
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean, it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you

Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo beach and everyone is so sad
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Pretty little girl, everyone cried
She was the victim, of sweet suicide
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was just looking for you

Desk clerk told me, girl was washed up
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?

Picked up my key, didn't reply
Went to my room, started to cry
You were small, an angel, are you gone, gone?

Down by the ocean it was so dismal
I was just standing with shock on my face
The hearse pulled away and the girl that had died, it was you

You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone
Gone, gone
Gone, gone
Goodbye",Redondo Beach
Patti Smith,"The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at johnny, johnny wanted to run,
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in johnny
The boy disappeared, johnny fell on his knees,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started crashing his head against the locker,
Started laughing hysterically

When suddenly johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi

Life is filled with holes, johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, ?oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ? ?
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go rimbaud,
Go rimbaud, go rimbaud,
And go johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes,
Twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes, twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
The sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire

I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go rimbaud go rimbaud go rimbaud)
And go johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
That's how I
I died
(at that tower of babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land

Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers,
Like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse? )
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(his fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
And go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
Saw this sweet young thing (fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter

In the sheets
There was a man
Dancing around
To the simple
Rock & roll

We don't give a shit
Ladies' lost electricity
Take vows inside of it

Desire to dance
Too startled to try
Wrap my legs 'round you
Starting to fly

Let's explore 
Up there, up there, up there
On the twenty-fifth floor

Circle all around me
Coming for the kill, kill, kill
Oh kill me baby
Like a kamikaze
Heading for a spill
Oh, but it's all spilt milk to me

Love's pretty

I'm gonna make contact tonight

Within the context of neo rock

Pollution is a necessary result of the inability of man to reform and transform waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste
The transformation of waste is perhaps the oldest preoccupation of man
Man being the chosen alloy, he must be reconnected via shit, at all cost
Inherent within us is the dream of the task of the alchemist to create from the clay of man
And to recreate from excretion of man pure and then soft and then solid gold

All must not be art
Some art we must disintegrate
Positive, anarchy must exist

I feel it swirling around me
I feel it feeling no pain

Take my hand come undercover

Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Patti Smith,"Nodding tho the lamp's lit low, nod for passers underground.
To and fro she's darning, and the land is weeping red and pale.
Weeping yarn from Algiers. Weeping yarn from Algiers.

Weaving tho the eyes are pale, what will rend will also mend.
The sifting cloth is binding, and the dream she weaves will never end.
For we're marching toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers.

Lullaby tho baby's gone. Lullaby a broken song.
Oh, the cradle was our call. When it rocked we carried on.
And we marched on toward Algiers. For we're marching toward Algiers
We're still marching for Algiers. Marching, marching for Algiers.
Not to hail a barren sky. Sifting cloth is weeping red.
The mourning veil is waving high a field of stars and tears we've shed.
In the sky a broken flag, children wave and raise their arms.
We'll be gone but they'll go on and on and on and on and on.",Broken Flag
Patti Smith,"Last night, last night I awoke up from a dream
Came face to face with my face facing the tombstone teeth
Of a man called Chiklets, he came down through the ages
With the desperate beauty of a middleweight boxer
He came beating the force field with the elegant grace

He was, he was trying to get a perfect grip
But there was no absolute grip
He was in a sailboat, in a glass bottom boat
And the bottom of a boat

He was coming down through the ages
Sea waxy molten, hot liquid spilling down to the spiny eye
Of the village the spinal eye, of the victim the spiny eye a tip
It was livin’ in, he was a victim like a question mark

Hovering over him what do you want from him
What do you want from him
He’s goin’ down on a dream too much unexplained
What do you think do you about

Think there was an actual
You think there was an actual connection at
I just can't imagine, I just can't imagine
A connection going down there

I can't imagine any connection
It’s like, like a boxing ring
All with gold ropes soft
Turned very soft desperate karat

Top spinning and coming down
Through the ages

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Gloria in Excelsis Deo/Gloria [Van Morrison Version]

He turned his back and his own people shot him
And he fell on his knees
Before the burning plane
And he beheld fields of gold his land his sun
And he arose his blood aflame
The clouds pressed with hand prints stained

One last breath
The sky is high
The hungry earth
The empty vein
The ashes rain
Death's own bed
Man's own kin
Into the wind
One last breath
Hole in life
Love knot tied
Braid undone
Child born
The hollow horn
Warrior cried
A warrior died
One last breath
Lick of flame
Spirit moaned
Spirit shed
The heavens fed
Man's own kin
Grips the sky
And he's gone again

Hey now man's own kin
We lay down into the wind
Grateful arms grateful limbs
Grateful heart he's gone again

Hey now man's own kin
He ascends into the wind

Patti Smith,"In the medieval night 
'Twas love's design 
And the sky was open 
Like a Valentine 
All the lacy lights 
Where wishes fall 
And like Shakespeare's child 
I wished on them all 

Ah to be your destiny 
Was all that I pursued 
I could see the sights 
From the lofty heights 
But my heart obscured the view 

I was looking for you 
Looking for you 
What could I do 
I was looking for you 

Along the black river 
The ambassador jewels 
And you were reflected 
In all that I saw 
In the towers of gold 
In the wheel and wing 
Gripping my senses 
Like an ancient claim 

Many is the time I knelt in the light 
Appealing to all that I know 
Guide my eyes and steps 
That I may find love true 

I was looking for you 
Looking for you 
What could I do 
I was looking for you 

Come on darlin' 
All that hearts desire 
Was written before us 
In the medieval fire 
It was love's design 
In the glittering stars 
Like Shakespeare's child 
To be where you are 

From the Portobello Road 
To the Port of Marseilles 
Where the dervish turns 
Where the wild goats play

I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it
It was ladened with all kinds of shit
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing
I turned my back walked away
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing

Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner
I was listening they were saying this and saying that
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered
Nothing good was coming I just stood there
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing
I walked the floor then I looked away

Gonna get well I'm gonna do something

I saw it floating in the river

Patti Smith,"The fans were whirlin'
Like the blades of a 'copter
Liftin' into the skies above some foreign land
Soaked with the bodies of so many friends.

Johnny waved
He was on his way home
He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,
And all the twisted things he'd seen.
He waved goodbye
And the blades hit
Something
Maybe just fate, but the blades hit
The 'copter went up in flames
And johnny never went marchin' home
Johnny never went marchin' home

They took his name
And they carved it on a slab of marble
With several thousand other names
All the fallen idols
The apples of their mother's eye
Just another name

Meanwhile
Back on that burning shore
Johnny's comrades stood speechless
They looked with uh-uh-uh-uh disbelieving eyes
As those bits of metal and the embers
The embers of his eyes
Fanned out into the air
Black dust
Flames

Oh johnny! some day they'll make a movie about you
And in the making of that movie
Some mad apocalypse
It will become even stranger than the simple act
Just a boy going up up up
Just a boy going up
In flames in the smoke
Just another life
Just another breath
And who'll remember
Oh eternity now
As eternal as a sheet of marble
Eternal as a slab on a green hill
And your name
And all your fallen brothers
And all the ones not cut
All the ones remembered only in the hearts
A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter
Shall not shall not fade shall not fade

Your ancestors salute you
And the gods of your ancestors salute you
Having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors
The gods of your ancestors salute you
Having been formed by your ancestors
The gods of your ancestors salute you
They draw you in they draw you through
They draw they draw you through that golden door

Mornin' boy [come on in boy]
We remember you
We conceived of you
We conceived of your breath
We conceived of the whole human race
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing
Like a tulip bending in the wind
Sometimes it comes back to us
In the form of a handful of dust
Comes back in the form of a smitten child
Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones
Souls cleaved from hearts
They come back to us
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues
But we turn not our backs
We press our lips
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one
And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you
Mornin' boy [come on in boy]
It's eternal love

Well here, go ahead, run through that flame
Awww man, running through your mind
You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail
And you swirled it around your head
And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it
And you knew that it would be your own
But you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die
Because you know you would feel your own
You would feel your own
But you're remembered!
You're remembered!
You're remembered dead!
You're remembered dead!
You're remembered dead!

Feel how it trembles inside
You’ve got the butterflies, all tied up
Don’t make me chase you, even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I’m just too demanding
Maybe I’m just like my father, too bold

Maybe, I'm just like my mother
She’s never satisfied
Why must we scream at each other?

Ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you

Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I’m just too demanding
Maybe I’m just like my father, too bold

Girls sing notes of heaven Birds lift them up to the sky

Pretty in pink It makes me wonder
What could ever bring you down I see tears falling
From those eyes of brown

Hearing a voice, you turn your head You vanish into the mist
Of your thoughts And I
Want to grasp What brings you down
Open up those eyes of brown

The world is changing Your heart is growing

Hearing a voice you turn your head Girls turn by ones, by twos
Notes pour bad and tender Eradicate your blues

Not a whim When you be cashing in

The burdens that were his Mending the coat

Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, “Break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening.”
Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, “Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me.”

The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, “Take me please!”

Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, “Break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.”

Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right.

Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome.
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me,
Lo I turned my neck toward home.
Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life,
'Til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light.

In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true.

To try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love
We could save the world if they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

Who gain the world and lose their soul

Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed
For the birds and the beasts and all humankind.
All through the night I felt drawn in by him
And I heard him call
Like a distant hymn

I retreated from the silence of my room
Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn
And entered the basilica that bore his name
Seeing his effigy I bowed my head
And my racing heart I gave to him I kneeled and prayed
And the sleep that I could not find in the night
I found through him
I saw before me the world of his world
The bright fields, the birds in abundance
All of nature of which he sang
Singing of him
All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked
His nature that was nature itself
And I heard him - I heard him speak
And the birds sang sweetly
And the wolves licked his feet.

Dove c’è offesa, Perdono.
Dove c’è dubbio, Fede.
Dove c’è disperazione, Speranza.
Dove c’è oscurità, Luce.
Dove c’è tristezza, Gioia.

Di essere compreso, quanto comprendere.
Di essere amato, quanto amare.)

But I could not give myself to him
I felt another call from the basilica itself
The call of art - the call of man
And the beauty of the material drew me away
And I awoke, and beheld upon the wall
The dream of Constantine
The handiwork of Piero della Francesca
Who had stood where I stood
With his brush stroked The Legend of the True Cross
He envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy
But as he was passing the river
An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels
An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves

All through the night a dream drew toward him
As an advancing Crusade
He slept in his tent on the battlefield
While his men stood guard
And an angel awoke him
Constantine within his dream awoke
And his men saw a light pass over the face of the King
The troubled King
And the angel came and showed to him
The sign of the true cross in heaven
And upon it was written

In this sign shall thou conquer

In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight
But another kind of radiance lit the face of Constantine
And in the morning light
The artist, seeing his work was done
Saw that it was good

In this sign shall thou conquer

He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own
And he dreamed of Constantine carrying into battle in his right hand
An immaculate, undefiled single white Cross
Piero della Francesca, as his brush stroked the wall
Was filled with a torpor
And fell into a dream of his own

From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out
He saw the King rise, fitted with armor
Set upon a white horse
An immaculate cross in his right hand.
He advanced toward the enemy
And the symmetry, the perfection of his mathematics
Caused the scattering of the enemy
Agitated, broken, they fled

And Piero della Francesca waking, cried out
All is art - all is future!
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
With a brush and an eye full of light
But as he advanced in age
The light was shorn from his eyes
And blinded, he laid upon his bed
On an October morning 1492, and whispered
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure
Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure

And a world away - a world away
On three great ships
Adventure itself as if to answer
Pulling into the New World
And as far as his eyes could see
No longer blind
All of nature unspoiled - beautiful - beautiful
In such a manner that would have lifted the heart of St. Francis
Into the realm of universal love

Columbus stepped foot on the New World
And witnessed beauty unspoiled
All the delights given by God
As if an Eden itself, as if Eden had opened her heart to him
And opened her dress
And all of her fruit gave to him
And Columbus so overwhelmed
Fell into a sleep of his own
All the world in his sleep
All of the beauty, all of the beauty entwined with the future
The twenty-first century
Advancing like the angel
Advancing like the angel
That had come
To Constantine
Constantine in his dream
Oh this is your cross to bear
Oh Lord Oh Lord let me deliver
Hallowed adventure to all mankind
In the future
Oh art cried the painter
Oh art - Oh art - cried the angel
Art the great material gift of man
Art that hath denied
The humble pleas of St. Francis
Oh thou Artist
All shall crumble into dust
Oh thou navigator
The terrible end of man
This is your gift to mankind
This is your cross to bear
And Columbus saw all of nature aflame
The apocalyptic night
And the dream of the troubled King
Dissolved into light",Constantine's Dream
Patti Smith,"At the edge of the world
Where you were no one

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit

I can chew like a cannibal
I can yell like a cat
I even had you believing that I really really like it like that
But there was never a moment
Not a moment
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul

I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, I tear out my heart
And I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit

You left open the window till the morning
And the winter walked in
Reality fired her wooden bullet
Splintered under our skin
They say I'm walking on freedom
This is freedom
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
Now I know
I still don't blame you for leaving,baby
It's cold living with ghosts

I spit, I spit in the eye
I tear, I tear out my heart
and I scatter the bits
I stay unseen by the light
I stay untold by the truth
I'm sold by a lie
By this I am able in all of my travels
To make these memories quit
But tonight I clearly recall every little bit",Every Little Bit
Patty Griffin,"We are swimming with the snakes
At the bottom of the well
So silent and peaceful in the darkness where we fell
But we are not snakes and what's more
We never will be
And if we stay swimming here forever we will
Never be free

I heard them ringing the bells
In heaven and hell
They got a secret
They're getting ready to tell
It's falling from the sky
Calling from the graves
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Open your eyes, boy, I think we are saved
Let's take a walk on the bridge
Right over this mess
Don't need to tell me a thing, baby
We've already confessed
And I raised my voice to the air
And we were blessed
Everybody needs a little forgiveness [Repeat: x1]

We are calling for him tonight on this
Thin phone line
As usual we're having ourselves one
hell of a time
And the planes keep flying right over our heads
No matter how loud we shout
""Hey, hey, hey !""
And we keep waving and waving
Our arms in the air
But we're all tired out

I heard somebody say
Today's the day
A big old hurricane
Is blowing our way
Knocking over the buildings
Killing all the light
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night
Open your eyes, boy, we made it through the night
Let's take a walk on the bridge
Right over this mess
Don't need to tell me a thing, baby
We've already confessed
And I raised my voice to the air
And we were blessed
It's hard to give
It's hard to get
It's hard to live still I think it's the best bet
It's hard to give and I'm never gonna forget
But everybody needs a little forgiveness
Everybody needs a little forgiveness",Forgiveness
Patty Griffin,"Ain't no talkin to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand the stupid words of pride
It would take an acrobat, and I already tried all that so
I'm gonna let him fly
Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
But you can't recall just where or why
So there was really nothing to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said I'm gonna let him fly

There's no mercy in a live wire
No rest at all in freedom
Of the choices we are given it's no choice at all
The proof is in the fire
You touch before it moves away
But you must always know how long to stay and when to go

And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so
It took awhile to understand the beauty of just letting go
Cause it would take an acrobat, I already tried all that
I'm gonna let him fly

I'm gonna let him fly",Let Him Fly
Patty Griffin,"We were drinking like the Irish 
But we were drinking scotch
Bartender turned on a movie
Everybody turned to watch
And every single eye was gleaming
As he reached the final scene

Here's lookin' at you, kid

It's a mad mission
Under difficult conditions

To the loving cup

But I got the ambition

I think I've seen the look before,yes,
it's kind of non-committal
It says come hither, baby, but then he's hard wood to whittle
it says it don't mean a thing, but still, somebody does
He'd like you to join the club that likes to say
there's no such thing as love and

flying low at night
Flying blind and looking for
Any sign of light
You're cold and scared, and all alone
You'd do anything just to make it home

Patty Griffin,"Diamonds, roses,I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

Everywhere is somewhere And nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer

Every time I see him he smiles
And he tells me how well he's walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die, he'd hear about it eventually

Patty Griffin,"She sees him laying in the bed alone tonight
The only thing a touching him is a crack of light
Pieces of her hair are wrapped around and 'round his fingers
He reaches for her side for any sign of her that lingers
And she says you are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
One of them bullets went straight for the jugular vein
There were people running,
A flash of light then everything changed
Nothing really matters in the end you know all the worries sever
Don't be afraid for me my friend
One day we all fall down forever
She says you are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
The wedding date was June just like any other bride
She loved him like no one before and it was good to be alive
Sometimes that can slip away as fast as any fingers through your hands
So you let time forgive the past and go and make some other plans
You are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight
You are not alone
Laying in the light
Put out the fire in your head
And lay with me tonight

Patty Griffin,"You know you've done enough when every bone is sore
You know you've prayed enough when you don't ask any more
You know you're coming to some kind of understanding
When every dream you've dreamed has passed and you're still standing
Mama says god tends to every little skinny sheep
So count your ribs and say your prayers and get to sleep
Nothing is louder to god's ears than a poor mans sorrow
Daddy is poor today and he will be poor tomorrow

Hey that's the poor man's house
Everybody get a look at the poor man's house
Everywhere they went before must have turned them out
And now they're living in a poor man's house

There's nothing like poverty to get you into heaven
They got a lot of wine and fish up there
And the bread's unleavened
They got a lot of ears that heard a whip go crack
Lots of missing toes and fingers and scars upon their backs
Daddy's been working too much for days and days
He doesn't eat
He never says much but I think this time it's got him beat
It isn't that he isn't strong or kind or clever
Your daddy's poor today
And he will be poor forever

That's the poor man's house
Those kids are living in a poor man's house
They walk to school with the soles of their shoes worn out
And come home in the evening to the poor man's house

What are you chopping that wood for
Why are you growing that corn
Mama's sewing a brand new shirt and
You're wearing the one that's torn
I guess it's for some one else's kid who wasn't born 
In a poor man's house

Who knew that sunshine don't hold up to dark
Whose businesses fail

Who sleep in the park

And outlandish things to her family just to scare us
Whose heart went pokin' where it shouldn't ought

Whose mother could only sppit at the thought of

Then he'd burn down the house to announce his arriva1

I hated being your fool
So I got a little bit more mud on my face

Those who ain't afraid to touch

And wonder who's gonna win
Who is gonna win it or wear it out
I change the lock on the door
Or learn how to take a little more
I can outrun all of the devils there
But never the doubt
Try not to throw all your money into 20/20 vision
For the world won't wait on politics or indecision

Time will do the talking

Can you see the one beside you

Whatever I knew it was nothing at all
Nothing at all, just making me small
Smaller and smaller
I fall back

Sooner or later with a view from the ground
Chasing the race and the races run you down
Sooner or later with a view from the ground
And a tear in your eye
You say baby why can't we fly
Into the blue sky
High
Into the blue sky

Be my singing lesson
Be my song
When I tell you I'm falling
You tell me I'm strong
You say trees have grown tall
Birds have flown high
Higher and higher
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
I'll fly over a rainbow
I'll be sun kissed
Sail around the planet Venus
And send a long letter
Way back home
That says all that I know
All that I know is the blue sky
High in the blue sky

The farther I come the farther I fall
Whatever I knew it was nothing at all
Trees have grown tall, birds have flown high
Higher and higher

Liars can say it all just as well

Baubles of gold, stars in your hair
Reflections that told that they were not there
And the diamonds on your cheeks have turned to flames

And up in the air they would write your name there
But love would fall to pieces in the rain
Who would know better than you
A hundred love letters and none of them true

With nothing so rare as the love that it brings
In the silence of a smile that understands

For the simple daughter of a simple man

You've been gone now a couple years
Well, I guess it takes while
For someone to really disappear
And I remember where I was
When the word came about you
It was a day much like today
The sky was bright, and wide, and blue

And I wonder where you are
And if the pain ends when you die
And I wonder if there was
Some better way to say goodbye

Today my heart is big and sore
It's tryin' to push right through my skin
I won't see you anymore
I guess that's finally sinkin' in
'Cause you can't make somebody see
By the simple words you say
All their beauty from within
Sometimes they just look away 

But I wonder where you are
And if the pain ends when you die
And I wonder if there was

Raised his hand in homeroom 
He called the morning attendance

In the summer he'd march without any shoes 
Until the soles of his feet turned black

Well I wish that you could see me when I'm flying in my dreams
The way I laugh there way up high
The way I look when I fly
The way I live
The way I fly

Patty Griffin,"Long black limousine
Shiniest car I've ever seen
The back seat is nice and clean
She rides as quiet as a dream
Someone dug a hole six long feet in the ground
I said goodbye to you and I threw my roses down
Ain't nothing left at all in the end of being proud
With me riding in a race car, and you flying through the clouds

I've had some time to think about you
And watch the sun sink like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long ride home

One day I took your tiny hand
Put your finger in the wedding band
Your daddy gave a piece of land
We laid ourselves the best of plans
Forty years go by with someone laying in your bed
Forty years of things you wish you'd never said
How hard would it have been to say some kinder words instead
I wonder as I stare up at the sky turning red

I've had some time to think about you
And watch the sun sink like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long ride home

Headlights staring at the driveway
The house is dark as it can be
I go inside and all is silent
It seems as empty as the inside of me

I've had some time to think about you

I can walk 
Down the block

Plastic a cap 
On my hair 
I used to mind 
Now I don't care 
I used to mind 
Now I don't care 
Cause I'm gray

Did I show you this picture of my nephew 
Taken at his big birthday surprise 
At my sister's house last Sunday 
This is Monday and I'm making pies
I'm making pies

Thursday nights 
I go and type
Down at the church 
For Father Mike
It gets me out 
And he ain't hard to like
At all

Jesus stares at me 
In my chair
With his big blue eyes 
And his honey brown hair 
And he's looking at me 
Way up there 
On the wall

Did I show you this picture of my sweetheart
Taken of us before the war
Of the Greek and his Italian girl 
One Sunday at the shore 

We tied our ribbons to the fire escape 
They were taken by the birds 
Who flew home to the country 
As the bombs rained on the world

Patty Griffin,"Well he jumps in the taxi, headed for the sky
He's off to slay some demon dragonfly
And he looked at me, that long last time
Turned away again and I waved goodbye

In an envelope, inside his coat
Is a chain I wore, around my throat
Along with, a note I wrote
Said ""I love you but, I don't even know why""

But darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying

Sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There'll be an endless rope
And nobody crying.

Well a long night turns into a couple long years
Of me walkin' around, around this trail of tears
Where the very loud voices of my own fears
Is ringin' and ringin' in my ears

It says that love is long gone
Every move I make is all wrong
Says you never gave a damn for me
For anything, for anyone

And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread
Make the sound of thousands of angels instead
Tonight where you might be laying your head

Beating close to mine
Pounding up against the stone and steel
Walls that I won't climb
Sometimes a hurt is so deep deep deep
You think that you're gonna drown
Sometimes all I can do is weep weep weep
With all this rain falling down

Strange how hard it rains now
Rows and rows of big dark clouds
When I'm holding on underneath this shroud
Rain

Its hard to know when to give up the fight
Two things you want will just never be right
Its never rained like it has to night before
Now I don't want to beg you baby
For something maybe you could never give
I'm not looking for the rest of your life
I just want another chance to live

Strange how hard it rains now
Rows and rows of big dark clouds
When I'm holding on underneath this shroud
Rain, oh rain

When I'm holding on underneath this shroud

Patty Griffin,"I met a little girl and I settled down
In a little house on out on the edge of town
We got married, swore we'd never part
Then little by little we drifted from eachother's hearts
At first I thought it was just restlessness
That it'd fade as time went by, and our love would heal
In the end it was something more, I guess
Tore us apart and made us real

I'm driving a stolen car
Down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night I wait to get caught
But I never do

She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel one hundred years old

I'm driving a stolen car
On a pitch black
And I'm telling myself
It's gonna be all right
I drive by night
And I travel in fear
That in this darkness
I will disappear",Stolen Car
Patty Griffin,"Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on

And you willingly surrender to me, but darling will it last
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright
Tomorrow night will you say those lovely things you said tonight

Must have walked ten million miles
Wore some shoes that weren't my style
Ten million miles

I've been kind I've told some lies
Like anyone who's lived or died
Like anyone who's ever tried 
To walk ten million miles

I memorize and I forget
I do some things that I regret
Wish for things I never get
Walk in the rain and get wet

I must have walked ten million miles
Must have walked ten million miles
So think before you criticize
Ten million miles

I traveled 'round from place to place
Wore some rags around my waist
And other times, a dress of lace
And always search for your sweet face

You oughta come some time for tea
Maybe we could see the sea
Talk a lot, or let things be
Just enjoy the mystery

I must have walked ten million miles

Patty Griffin,"Ain't no talkin' to this man
Ain't no pretty other side
Ain't no way to understand the stupid words of pride
It would take an acrobat, and I already tried all that so
I'm gonna let him fly
Things can move at such a pace
The second hand just waved goodbye
You know the light has left his face
But you can't recall just where or why
So there was really nothing to it
I just went and cut right through it
I said I'm gonna let him fly

There's no mercy in a live wire
No rest at all in freedom
Of the choices we are given it's no choice at all
The proof is in the fire
You touch before it moves away
But you must always know how long to stay and when to go

And there ain't no talkin' to this man
He's been tryin' to tell me so

Where up in a window a curtain will sway

Patty Griffin,"A couple of young girls went
Sailing down A1A
Into the arms of Florida
Sailing down a highway
Singing their heads off
Protected by the holy ghosts
Flying in the ocean
Driving with their eyes close

The night wants to kiss you deep
And be on his way
Pretend he don't know you the very next day
Isn't it hard sometimes
Isn't it lonely?
How I still hang around here
And there's nothing to hold me

You slide down into the seat
From twelve hours on your feet
And get the tide to wash you away
For thousands and thousands of days
And someone you never meet
Signs a check you get every week
You try and you still can't forget
All the strangers that you have met

The night never owed you nothing anyway
Makes promises that he never intends to keep every day
Isn't it hard sometimes
Isn't lonely?
How I still hang around here
And there's nothing to hold me

Every time, every year
The travelers come and go
You see them landing with their pale wings
And flying back to the snow
And the summer comes marching in
With his heavy boots on
Kicking along the blacktop
Sidewalks of A1A
The young girls in their bare feet
Cigarettes smoking
Looking every which way
Wishing and hoping

And you want the night just to let you sleep
And be on his way
Wrap you up in some cool sheets
And have nothing to say

Isn't hard sometimes
Isn't it lonely?
How I still hang around here
And there's nothing to hold me",Florida
Patty Griffin,"Tonight
I sing soft and low
Just like the moon
Over the snow
I hear icicles falling in the dark

We're just like anyone else
We just want a little bit
Of sun for ourselves
And a little bit of rain
To make it all grow
Maybe a minute or two
To get lost in the glow of love

There's always someone throwing matches around
Waving the shiny new knife
The first to run when the house burns down
I've seen it everyday of my life
I must confess there appears to be
Way more darkness than light
I want to fall like a pearl
To the bottom of the sea
There no one will find us tonight

Tonight
It might look pretty bad
We might lose everything
We thought that we had
But shadows will pass
Smoke, it will clear
If something survives of us around here
I'll be glad 'cause I know
I was lost in the glow
Of love",Icicles

Everybody had a kite
They were flying everywhere
And all the trouble went away
And it wasn't just a dream
All the trouble went away

In the middle of the night
We try and try with all our mights
To light a little light down here
In the middle of the night
We dream of a million kites
Flying high above
The sadness and the fear

Little sister just remember
As you wander through the blue
The little kite that you sent flying
On a sunny afternoon
Made of something light as nothing
Made of joy that matters too
How the little dreams we dream
Are all we can really do

The world turns with all of it's might
A little diamond colored blue
In the middle of the night
We keep sending little kites
Until a little light gets through",Kite Song

We run out of luck, we run out of days
We run out of gas, hundred miles away
From a station

There's a war and a plague yeah, smoke and disaster
Lions in the coliseum, screams of a laughter
Motherless children, a witness and a bible
Nothing but rain ahead and no chance for our survival

Just before the flood comes, just before the night falls
Just before the blood runs into the valley
Just before my eyes go, just before we can't go no further
Love throws a line to you and me

I heard someone calling me from very far away
Sister oh sister, did I hear them say?
Prisoner of this endless story of pain
You hold the key, try to find the way

And just before the flood comes, just before the night falls
Just before the blood runs into the valley
Just before my eyes go, just before it all blows to pieces
You see love throw a line to you and me

Love throw a line
Love throw a line
Love throw a line

Patty Griffin,"All you kids get out the back door
I've never seen her this bad before
She took all her favorite things down from the window
And broke 'em all over her clean floor

It's Saturday at the mansion
The oldest boy walks with a slouch
The young ones are wild in back of the house
And she gave up and went back to sleep on the couch

Something as simple as boys and girls
Gets tossed all around and then lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer

When I was little I'd stare at her picture
And talk to the mother of God
I swear sometimes I'd see her lips move
Like she was trying to say something to me

When I was eighteen I moved to Florida,
Like everyone sick of the cold does,
And I waited on old people waiting to die
I waited on them until I was

Something as simple as boys and girls 
Gets tossed all around and then lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer

So I'm wearing my footsteps into this floor
One day I won't live here anymore
Someone will wonder who lived here before
And went on their way

I live too many miles from the ocean
And I'm getting older and odd
I get up every morning with a black cup of coffee
And I talk to the mother of God

Something as simple as boys and girls
Gets tossed all around and then lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer
Can wait a long time for an answer",Mother of God

And the different colored doorways you thought would let you in one day
Goodbye to the old bus stop frozen and waiting

You walk across the baseball green
The grass has turned to straw
A flock of birds tries to fly away from where you are
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye old friend
I can't make you stay
I can't spend another ten years wishing you would anyway

It gets me on my way

To help me think a little less about the things I miss
To help me not to wonder how I ended up like this
Walk down to the railroad track and ride a rusty train
With a million other faces I shoot through the city veins
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye old friend
You wanted to be free
And somewhere beyond the bitter end is where I wanna be

Against the telephone wire
And even I'm getting tired of useless desires

Like diamonds on a winter day

Patty Griffin,"I am no longer young, I'm an old man's daughter
We got caught with the sun going down
We spent most of our days adrift on the water
That's how I know my way around
And it's hard to be free
When freedom is just me
And the waves on the terrible sea

I could land with the rest of all the broken down birds
That's where I found my way home
With the rest of the faces on the face of the earth
Facing off with the great unknown
And all the tears that we cry
Is something gone wrong
Is somebody lost
The places long gone

Keep on moving, baby, keep on moving
The wave's coming over your knees
And it's hard to be free

Be some things that I be
And come all the way, all the way, all the way home again",Free

Here's a little time we can borrow
Forget all our troubles in these moments so few

That all that we really have to do
Is have ourselves, a heavenly day

Lay here and watch the trees sway
Oh, can't see no other way, no way, no way

Got no clouds up above me bringing me tears

Got nothing to tell you, I've got nothing much to say

And it has not been easy for you
There's things I'll never tell you till the day I die
Things I've done I can never undo

Patty Griffin,"Have you ever been baptized in the cool winter water
On a Sunday morning when the sky was gray?
You filed out of the churchyard, so cold it was silver
To gold, tan, and blue cars, and the cars drove away
All the memories fade, send the ghosts on their way
Tell them they've had their day, it's someone else's tomorrow

The tall and the tiny ships on the water
Farther and farther, floating away
Will never return now, all wooden and burned out
They echo and groan now in their salty graves

I might look like a little old man to you

Just overhead on the old trapeze
In the old tent tonight, spotlight going round
One of these nights the old girl's going down
Hallelujah, the old girl's going down

She started with us on the back of a horse
Just seventeen and already divorced
She took to the air with the greatest of ease
Like she was born to be gliding on the old trapeze

Some people don't care if they live or they die
Some people want to know what it feels like to fly
Gather their courage and they give it a try

Some guy broke her heart and how her heart it did ache
So she went to the tent of the lady of the snakes
Who gave her a potion and she drank it in
After that her heart never ached again
After that her heart never ached again

Some poeple don't care if they live or they die

Because you asked me to
Up over the clouds
To where the sky was blue
I could see all around me
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
I've never been nothing but tired
And I'll be walking
Till the day I expire
Sometimes I lay down
No more can I do
But then I go on again
Because you ask me to

Some days I look down
Afraid I will fall
And though the sun shines
I see nothing at all
Then I hear your sweet voice, oh
Oh, come and then go, come and then go
Telling me softly
You love me so

There’s gonna be some rainy Sundays
Wishing one day, I’ll see you again

Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself
But I know you’re headed somewhere else
And all the secrets that you keep will be, the things I’ll never know
Doesn’t matter either way, I’ll still miss you when you go

I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone
I know you don’t believe that, you’re wrong
There’s gonna be some strangers laughing through the hotel walls
And I’m gonna wish your footsteps would come walking down the hall

And the moon will be high, bright as a pearl
Shining through my window on the dark side of the world
And I’ll be thinking of you, dancin’ somewhere
The way you were back then, the moonlight in your hair

Patty Griffin,"Well, I danced in the arms of a black haired girl
In Scollay Square after the war
And I drank to get drunk, and sank and I stunk
Like a drunk on a subway floor

And I never did marry Cathy O’Shea
She met another and they went their way
To the wind you’re a toy
Just a drunk Irish boy
Just a face in the crowd
I’ll be back around
To show you all something someday

There are some things that must remain secret
You can find no good reason to tell
There’s too many men telling their secrets these days
And I’d like to tell them to all go to hell

So I never had dreams, and they never came true
As far as you know anyway
To the wind you’re a toy
Just a drunk Irish boy
Just a face in the crowd
I’ll be back around
To show you all something someday

Gory be, glory be, to the highest of trees
We used to climb, my brother and me
High on her limbs, two laughing hyenas
Over West Rocks Berrys Cemetery

To the wind you’re a toy, just a thin Irish boy
Coming back home from the war
Just a face in the crowd
Just a drunk and out loud
Just you try looking down
’Cause I’ll be back around
To show you all something someday

Falling down a flight of stairs

Every heart is all worn down

So tonight I found a key
And drive away a little early 
Is the last time I wanna be that kind of lonely. 

There’s a scar below your left eye 
Fades away as you get older 
Isn't like you never told her 
What kind of man you really are

I don’t know why it’s so surprising 
Now the sun is almost rising 
Cause it’s early in the morning 
And the moon’s still standing tall

Someone left out on the highway
I seen him running by me
He don't belong to no one now

Dropped him out on 93
Mange was setting in on his hips and on his knees
Between the highways running north and south
We pulled on over and we put him out

Willie said he was old and going blind
Momma told me how she didn't mind
When Willie kicked him with his shoe
He just climbed on in just like he knew

Get whittled down to nothing
Broken down and crushed
In with the bones of
Wild old dogs

Dropped him out on 93
Tall grass was waving there just like the sea
He tore off running like we set him free
Just disappeared right in front of me

Back to the city of lost love

I walked around Harvard square
All the runaway kids are still hanging out there

Across the river Charles

I was slipping on a hog
And I flung into that sea of strong

For you to license to fly

You know you're not alone

Something's changed track
And they never fly
And they never fly
Reach up from the waves
You'll find that you're only waving goodbye

I went to where you lay
There were thousands of people
Just like you in a chain graveyard

You came out of there awake
Looking for the sky
And got a slap in the face
Well hey
Desperate needs a big led
And gets put in the place
You better know your place boy

On the bed, on the chair
Did I send myself away

Now meanwhile
He was reading magazines on the front line
He was trying not to think about her life
And what he might have done
'Cause it seemed like neither one of them
Were having any fun

See lately
She'd been acting kinda crazy lately
Oh man, I thought she was gonna hate me
'Cause I couldn't watch her little one
I had so much to do, I was so high strung

Am I making myself perfectly clear
And I'm on my way back just a couple more missions

Is a pretty bird
I see her in my dreams
On a mountain
Looking at the side of the world
I watch her spread her wings 

Moving one step at a time
One step at a time
In my own way
I follow

I'm going there
The morning air to breathe 
In my pocket
I will keep my northern words
Let her speak to me 

Moving one step at a time
One step at a time
In my own way

Carolina
Is a little girl
Who holds my hopes for me
And I wonder
Looking at the side of the world
What it is she sees

All of my fear
Fades like distant thunder

Worn like a stone
Days when I step lightly

Slow as a vine
Closest Thing to heaven
Is when we are entwined

Patty Larkin,"Danny
by Patty Larkin 
Danny flew his stars and stripes
Had a wife and a baby
Bounced him on his knee each night
Till he took off with the navy 

Jesus was a sailor, boys
Sailed on Galilee
If he went to work today
He'd have to sail the seven seas 

Danny took his fishing boat
A hundred miles away
To the waters no one owns
To the land of wind and wave 

All along the seacoast towns
Along the narrowland
They heard a storm was coming down
Two parts water one part sand 

The wind it drove the sea so wild
It opened like a jaw
Came down in a salty smile
And it ate up all it saw 

Fifteen feet the ocean rose
Fifteen feet it fell
When that boat began to fall
Must have seemed like hell 

Danny flew his stars and stripes
Had a wife and a baby
Saw them in the sea that night
When he went down with the navy

Dear Diary of a Great Unknown
Well I'm spending the night in the Twilight Zone
With the boys walking by with the backward baseball hats on
Past the billboard sign for the Wonder Bra 

And it's all lit up like it was MTV
And I freeze my face so nobody notices me
And I feel like a stranger with strange looking hands
Wearing a pair of rubber gloves in a complicated land 

Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good
good good good good 

There's a guy at the bar of the triangle
Well he's standing guard waiting for some kind of signal
And I remember Magritte in the cold hard rain
As I walk underneath the metal of the elevated train 

Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good to be alive
Ain't it good

With the keys to the highway tucked in the pocket of my jeans
Driving a brand new rented Cadillac through Kerouac's dreams

Don't want to make nobody angry
Don't want to wish nobody dead
Don't want to tell nobody to go to hell
And end up in hell instead 

I remember eight years old
And the boys were throwing apples at my head
They were laughing Sunday morning
At my black eye and my brand new dress 

Don't believe I want a Happy Meal
Don't believe blondes have more fun
Don't believe those pills will make me feel
Loved by everyone 

When I spin that radio dial around
And hear nothing but ""We've Only Just Begun""
I swear some guy in a suit somewhere
Is laughing at his little fun 

I wear a helmet and a seatbelt at home
Thought that would save me but it won't
I bolt the door and now there's strangers on the phone
It's not what they say it's what they Don't 

Don't want to make nobody angry
Don't want to wish nobody dead
Don't want to be the girl on the tilt-a-whirl
Hanging by a thread 

Does Virtual Reality mean
All of this is only in my head
Thene we both pull up to the big red stop
And the cop says ""Go ahead""

I'd like to go to Italy
Just to eat the food
Just to drink the wine
Just to go 

I'd like to go to Italy
Just to walk the road
Beneath the olive tree shade 

But Italy is a long distance call
Italy is a long distance call
Operators are standing by
But I don't speak Italian at all 

I have a map of Italy
And it looks just like a boot
Kicking aqua blue into the air 

A friend who went to Italy
Said the men are rude
They don't look at your eyes
Or your hair 

But Italy is a long distance call
Italy is a long distance all
Operators are standing by
But I don't speak Italian at all 

I'd like to go to Italy
So my passport would look used
Just to change my point of view

by Patty Larkin 
Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Wanted all of this attention I couldn't give
Drink a bottle of hard stuff, say I love you now save me
Just a big guy with a big sense of sin 

And the neighbor down the block in his underwear and socks
Keeping track of the losses and wins
With his wife hanging out the window wondering which way the wind blows
As I fumble the key in the lock again, singing 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me
If this is the good life who's choosin it
Oh me
Mama's best woman and daddy's best man
Oh me
I'm highly in danger of losin it 

Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Got a phone call from wild almost every night
Well he loved me but he really loved looking past me to the ladies
He was much too good looking for his height 

We were a couple of kis crawling out of the crib
Talking about the positives and the negatives of wine
Living our lives just like Hemingway did
But he was lucky, he was a genius most of the time 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me
If this is the good life who's choosin it
Oh me
Mama's best woman and daddy's best man
Oh me
I'm highly in danger of losin it 

He was sideswiped by the clue bus when it came to talking two of us
And the while thing ended ugly I guess
You can put your cards out on the table but if nobody wants to play 
Well, you haven't got a game you've got a mess 

I was looking at the judge leaning on my lawyer like a crutch
And the judge said what happened and why
I said, Johnny Was A Pyro and he acted like a baby
Now there's nothing like the sound of good bye 

Oh me
What am I doing with this ring on my hand
Oh me

My name is Mary
Mary Magdalene
I let the devil carry me
To the dark side of a sin 

I heard his laughter
And I tried to run
Now there is no ever after
After everything I've done 

I'm all broke up
I'm all broke down
Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now 

I took off running
Just to feel the wind
I shook off my innocence
Now I want it back again 

I heard the siren
Coming from the past
Ninety miles from nowhere
I was going nowhere fast 

I'm all broke up
I'm all broke down
Got turned around somehow
Who is my savior now 

My name is Mary

It was Me And That Train
One night in Colorado
Driving out of Denver
I was following a shadow 

Staring down the mountain 
With my mouth wide open
Wondering why
I thought about the ocean 

Up along the pass
The snow was blowing
On Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
Like the first time that I met you
You were holding up the sky
Leaning on your leather 

And I saw her with you
And I thought you were together
Like that moment in question
Took a ten second answer 

You were out the door
You were headed for me
Like Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
Like the night before Christmas
I was working downtown
A shopkeeper mistress 

And a guy in a ski mask
Had a gun in his pocket
And he pointed to the safe
And he told me to unlock it 

I put my jands in the air
And I laughed because I couldn't stop it
Just like Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train 

It was Me And That Train
When I drove into the canyon
It was coming up the river
Like a long lost companion 

And the walls went to heaven
Into endless darkness
But the train lit up the sandstone
Like a thousand pardons 

Just then underneath me
And my beating heart was
Me And That Train 

And the trucks were sliding sideways
Like sons of bitches
They were putting on their tire chains
Rolling into ditches
And I crawled on by
Like God was throwing the switches
For Me And That Train

Headed for the coast of Brazil 

Through the eye of a curtained window
She framed the portrait of her world
She'd watch as the sun stood waiting
She called herself a shadow of a girl
Autumn kissed the summer
She packed her things in the morning chill
Left the lace in the window waving

But he was born a banker's only son

Then they boarded a slow boat

I shook the truth

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

Heal up by the fire

Keep that ticket in your pocket

All those best laid plans
We'll leave to mice and men

I remember we weren't the kind to make an excuse
I remember thinking we would break all the rules
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

I remember hellfire and brimstone be damned
I remember trembling at the touch of your hand
Crossing the desert to the California sand
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

I remember angels who lent us their wings
Cigarettes and paperback poetry kings
Kicking up dust like we didn't need a thing
Where are those children now? Where are those children now?

Now the curtain calls and fails to fill me
I wander down the halls that used to thrill me

I remember singing, ""San Francisco Bay Blues""
I remember being happy just paying our dues
I remember thinking we had nothing to lose

You call me back and kiss me and my heart begins to sink
When I know that all you're doing's taking up another link in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking, cold, hard, lonely making chains

Love was never meant to be a one-way street
I was never meant to be falling at your feet
You got me where you want me and I don't know what to do
You don't belong to me but I belong to you in these

Chains, chains, shackles and chains
No matter what it takes some day I'm gonna break these
Chains, chains, shackles and chains
These love taking, heart breaking, cold, hard, lonely making chains",Chains
Patty Loveless,"Maybe in time
It'll get easier
When there's been enough time
Between us
Right now it seems so hard
To face that we're apart
And to believe one day
We'll put these years behind us

And we can go on living our lives
Like there's no yesterday
Like there's no hurt
And nothing has gone wrong
Go on living our lives
Like there's no memories
It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on

There was a time
When ours was a stronger love
Now we find it wasn't strong enough
When the feeling isn't there
And all that's left are tears to share
We can think about the time
Our love was better
We gotta go on living our lives
Like there's no yesterday
Like there's no hurt
And nothing has gone wrong
Go on living our lives
Like there's no memories
It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on

It won't be easy to do
But we gotta go on",Go On
Patty Loveless,"I've taken a lot of chances
I've drawn to a lot of bad cards
There was nothin I minded losing
So I never took losing to hard

Well since I won your love
I guess I've changed my ways
There's a lot of games in this old town
But there's one I no longer play

I won't gamble with your love
I don't care to risk that much
One thing you can be sure of
I won't gamble with your love

How many times did I play for sevens
When I gave those dice a roll
I know all of my prayers were answered
Sometimes yes
But a lot of times no

Now I know all I was after
Could be mine forever more
There are no other pleasures
I would trade my treasures for

I won't gamble with your love
I don't care to risk that much
One thing you can be sure of
I won't gamble with your love

These boys they come around
Say baby take a chance on me
I say no
They say why not?
Tell um I'm pretty happy with what I got
Anything else would be another long shot

Patty Loveless,"It's been a long time
Since you drifted away
Now there's nothing to live for it seems
But darlin' no matter where you are tonight
Your here with me in my dreams

I'll never grow tired of you sweetheart
No matter what you may do
They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you

I see your two blue eyes
Each night in my dreams
When I awake you're not there
Come back to me
And let's start life anew
Losing you's so hard to bear

I'll never grow tired of you sweetheart
No matter what you may do
They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you

I still wonder why
You drifted away
From the happiness
That might have been
I vision the time
Some day you'd be mine
And treasure the love
I can't win

They tell me lately
Your livin' so wrong
But I'll never grow tired of you",I'll Never Grow Tired of You
Patty Loveless,"Lately things haven't been goin' our way
And this road seems to get steeper every day
You crawl inside yourself, when I pull you out we fight
Seems like you've forgotten, I'm on your side

Do you think it makes you more of a man
To shoulder the worry, shield me if you can?
But it's this wall of silence, that's enough to make me scream
Tear it down and you'll find out we're on the same team

I'm on your side when you don't know where to turn
Look to the left or just to the right
Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side

Don't you remember how close we used to be
When you come home and bear your heart and soul to me?

I'm on your side when you don't know where to turn
Look to the left or just to the right
Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side

Turn to me when you can't turn off the lights
I'm on your side

Patty Loveless,"If you think I don't care
Just because I'm not there
Then my love
You had better think again

And if you think
There's someone knew
Who can take the place of you
Then my love
You had better think again

You live deep inside of me
As deep as I can see
There's no denying
I guess I'm feeling kind of blue
I'm lonely without you
Until we meet again

If you think my love will change
Just because you're away
Then my love
You had better think again

Send me a letter everyday
Send your love my way
And keep me smilin
Tell me all the things you do
And I will do it too
Until we meet again

If you think I don't care
Just because I'm not there

'Cause I feel you being gone
Something I wish I could lose

'Cause you're gonna leave me tonight

It's so hard on my heart
Goin' from good into gone
Oooh there ain't no easy way back
Into nights before you

There ain't no heartache like you

Patty Loveless,"Sometimes I get so angry with you
You treat me like an old worn out shoe
I've been here for you, for oh so long
One day you could reach and find me gone
One of these mornin's I could wake up with wings
And I'll be singin'

Fly away, I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow

Some days I love you
Some days I don't
First you say you will
And then again you won't
Well I guess all love
Has it's ups and downs
And maybe that's why
I stay around
But a woman can hurt
For just so long
And she'll start singin'
That travelin' song

Fly away, I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow

Should be easy to keep
Our love alive
There is no reason
That we can't take the time
Yet we live as if we have centuries
All the world at which to be
But the end could come at any time
For a love like your's and mine

Fly away, I could fly away
And if I'm in your way
I could be gone tomorrow

When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Well, I've tried and I've tried
And all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

Well you think, you would leave me behind
But I guess, you're the good timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart
To jump from heart to heart?

A tear may appear when I hold you near,
But that's for the sweet things you do.

If my heart had windows,

By your side, I'll stay,
Till we're old and gray,
Reminiscing the moments we knew.

Patty Loveless,"I don't fall in love as a rule
'Cause it always made me look like a fool
Keeps me up late
Can't concentrate
I pride myself on keeping my cool
I have to admit I'm a little bit in love with you

I don't want you gettin me wrong
Because I don't sit up at night by the phone
But you come around
I let my guard down
And I can't seem to leave you alone
I'll get over it
I'm just a little bit in love with you

Well I tell myself that a little bit of lovin never hurt a big girl like me
But I never have heard of a little heart ache and baby that's what's scarin me.

So don't you get your hope's up if I call
Because I always catch myself when I fall
I have to admit I'm just a little bit in love with you

Do you really want to know 
What I've been through
Let me just say I'm still wrapped up in you
And the broken heart keeps me alive
A little on the lonely side

I'm a little on the lonely side
Where only the strong survive
And I'm barely gettin' by

Some days I spend all my nights on memories
Goin' through what's left of what used to be
And the nights get longer all the time

Someone to love me
And though the night is lonely
And no one's there to hold me
I would rather be alone
Then be without you

And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
Someone to love
Like you
And nobody else will do

All my days, are spent this way
With no one to talk to
And oh the rain keeps fallin'
And I hear your voice 
Keep callin'
I'd rather be alone
Then without you

And just once in a lifetime
Someone like me can find
