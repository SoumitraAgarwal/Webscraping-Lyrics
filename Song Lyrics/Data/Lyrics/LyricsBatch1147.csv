Saliva,"All this time I believed your lie,
Raised your flag deep within your sight
I raise my flag to all you hide and drive your spike within me
Within you
Within me

What makes you think I want to know
It makes your life worth living
What makes you think I want to know
It makes your life worth living

All this time I believed your lie,
And raised your god deep within your sight
I raise my glass to all you guys who drive your god from nothing
From nothing means nothing.

What makes you think I want to know
It makes your life worth living
What makes you think I want to know
It makes your life worth living

Promises you made me,
All this is apology
So sick of lies,
Don't want to know
Go and tell somebody else I say.",Tongue
Saliva,"Caught out alone, and I'm tryin' to be free.
Caught up in things that are inside of me.
Lookin' for something that I cannot see.
Losing my faith but I'm tryin' to believe.

Tryin' to be free.
Losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my :.
The world is after me.
The world is after me.
There feeding their jones, I'm reluctant to fight.
Caught out alone at the end of the night.
They're lookin' for victims and lookin' for me.
I'm blind in my eyes but I'm tryin' to see.
Losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith.
Tryin' to see.
Losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my :
The world is after me.
The whole world is after me.
Feel like I'm caught in the ocean, there's always someone to help me down.
The twisted tangled emotions, there's always someone to help me drown.
Tryin' to believe.
Losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith.
Tryin' to be free.
Losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith, losing my faith.

On those Saturdays when kids go out and play,
Yo I was up in my room I let the stereo blaze,
Wasn't faded, not jaded
Just a kid with a pad and pen and a big imagination.
All this, I seek,
I find I push the envelope to the line,
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated.

Click, click boom
I'm on the radio station touring round the nation,
Leaving the scene in devastation.

I can see it in my mind,
I can see it in their eyes.
It's close enough to touch it now,
But far away enough to die.

What the hell is wrong with me?
My mom and dad weren't perfect,
But still you don't hear no cryin' ass bitchin' from me,
Like there seems to be on everybody's CD
So just sit back and relax and let me have your head for a minute,

That has yet to be presented,

Hey, I am turning away from a soul that you claim with desire.
Hey, can I give you the pain can you take it away just tonight.
I wish that we'd never gone this far.
And I wish I could take it away and celebrate how wrong you are.
And no one can make me feel like you.

Found although your six feet underground.
In the mirror, I can see your face just another trace of all the
Tragedy you passed down.
There are times when I can hear your voice, it's just like my
Voice and it still haunts me when you come around.
I feel like I wasted time when I didn't have you on my mind.
I feel like I'm all alone, how could I have known you would leave
Me here alive.

Oh my God, how did I make this far?
Why I can't I be where you are?

It would be heavenly to see you again.

Make me a superstar (Yeah!)
No matter who you are.

Razor blade and lines and I walk the line without feeling no one
Damn my throat is dry, I can't taste the wine from these empty bottles

Cover me in greed, 'cause you planted the seed when you fed my ego
Needless and disease for old invincible me like some kind of hero
Is it no surprise that I'm paralyzed by my fame and fortune
As I close my eyes and dive into the sky I'm dead 27 (Yeah!)

Does it make you feel,  more like a man
Was it all, just a part of your plan
This pistol's shakin' in my hands

Win or lose, I'm starting over again

I fold my hands as I begin to pray
Sometimes we gotta throw the past aside
And come what may, I'm gonna open up my eyes

To all my broken feelings
It's the only road I've known
I just wanna say to you

Maybe I won't feel the pain
When you leave me one day
And maybe it won't be too late
When you need me someday

Someone take me away
From the one who betrays
But things won't ever be the same
I'm starting over

In days gone by, I was hiding from myself
In all those lies and the truth was hard to tell
But I will try to turn my life around
I'll close my eyes so I can finally see

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Sally Fletcher,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening
Sally Harmon,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind

Sally Harmon,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Sally Harmon,"If the hands of time
Were hands that I could hold,
I'd keep them warm and in my hands
They'd not turn cold.

Hand in hand we'd choose
The moments that should last.
The lovely moments that
Should have no future and no past.

The summer from the top of the swing,
The comfort in the sound of a lullaby,
The innocence of leaves in the spring,
But most of all the moment
When love first touched me!

All the happy days
Would never learn to fly,
Until the hands of time
Would choose to wave Goodbye.",Brian's Song (The Hands of Time)
Sally Harmon,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine

""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Sally Oldfield,"With my damsel heart of secret art 
And my Roman earrings flashing in the dark, 
You got angel eyes, you got a devil's smile, 
And with my young maiden's charm I'll keep you for a while. 

I'll come ride with you now that summer's in the glen 
For you are the lord of all these merry men. 
You've been gone so long you're more stranger than kin, 
But if you come knocking on my door you know I'll let you in. 

I know you through the mask you wear, 
As you hold the shining room, 
You are one of the hundred horseman, 
Who ride beneath the moon! 
You are one of the hundred horsemen! 
Oh, I know who you are! 
You are one of the hundred horsemen, 
And you're riding on my heart.

Oh, you take me like the wind and you heal me again, 
With your sweet-tasting blade you cut my apple in the dark 
Oh, you are the only one who ever reached my heart.

Sally Oldfield,"The world was dark, he couldn't see the way
Guilt was in his heart
A broken glass in a blood stained hand
A woman with a broken heart
Somehow he knew he'd gotta find a way
Out of this prison cell
He looked up to the familiar skies
For a secret they might tell
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising
He left his home and he left his wife
He left his family
But every place that he traveled through
Himself he still could see
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
With no bitter memories
And just at the point he was breaking down
He looked up through the trees
Then Orion shone in the coal black night
He saw Andromeda rising
A golden light shone all around
Like the answer he had found
There were tears in his eyes
Like the rainy sky
His past life was an illusion
And he stands, a new born man as he sees Andromeda rising

It's exploring I must do alone
We share a life strong enough and we'll endure

Marlene, my love, you were born too soon
Running his fingers through her hair
Across her face to her lips so fine

Let one dream in my life come true
But the hands of time just won't turn back
So what remains is just my dream

Longing to see him again I've been away too long
But in the moonlight I can feel my heart is beating like a drum
A wild suspicion flashes dark across my mind
Walking up the driveway I can see another woman by his side
I held my hand out and this is what I cried
""Here's a silver dagger, present for the bride
Silver dagger, shining in the night""
Shining in the night

She offered me a cup of red, red wine
Said ""Won't you try to have a good time""
I turned my eyes on to her face and I could read all the lines

Walking up behind her I could see her face grow cold

Sally Oldfield,"Last night I couldn't stand the crowd
I went walking down by the sea
The full moon shone on the silver sand
And I felt you were following me
All the summer our friendships growing
I felt that you really cared
I never wanted a one night stand
'Cause something stronger was there
The way that I'm feeling tonight is lonely
'Cause we've lost something fine
We could have taken it much more slowly
And found the perfect time
Oh! we became two strangers in the dawn
Now that love has gone I can't forget
Please stay
Oh! we became two strangers in the dawn
The things we could have done and could have said
Were just a breath away
You've been talking about your life
And the way that you want it to be
It felt so good when you took my hand
And you shared your soul with me
Suddenly your eyes were changing
There was something on your mind
Then I could have turned away
But desire was so blind
Oh! we became two strangers in the dawn
Now that love has gone I can't forget

Man unknown! Of strangers ways.
How still and richly spoken stands your image in my gaze.
How still and richly spoken stands your image in my gaze.

Take this gift I bring to you
Now the light is breaking through!
Before you came, my life was caught in chains,
And now I feel the sky fill my eyes,
And all the riches of the Earth are lying at my feet

Sally Timms,"Above the dark highways on a black tar roof
Stood the Sad Milkman in love with the moon
She filled up his window with soft milky light
'Til he crawled up the chimney and into the night

Chorus:
But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalks a crowd gathered 'round
Flinging up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Calling up to the moonbeams, ""Come let down your hair!""

(repeat chorus)

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills
He wanted to fly up from the roof
Sailing up from the night wind to the arms of the moon

(repeat chorus two times)

Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear

Salmo,"Sto così fatto che di voi vedo solo il contorno
Oggi forse non torno
Mister chiamami Hyde, perché quando performo mi trasformo
Sogno di crepare sul palco
La gente con I pugni in alto tipo Black Panters
Ho girato i centri sociali d'Europa dentro un camper
Salmonlebon, il beat martella come Thor
Se Marra è il king del rap,
Io sono il king dell hardcore

Wall of death, flow Mosè 
Divido le folle cresciuto tra creste, chiodi, skater, jiolle, roller, techno folle
Sai cos'è? La vita è così triste
Specie quando mi fate fare le video interviste
È il mio viaggio allucinato in cui non torno mai indietro
Qui non c'è un piano b, non c'è un'uscita dal retro

Questo è death usb.
Death ush, attacco il mic al canon
Il flow gonfia il subwoofer
Belzebass cannon

Che succede al rap in Italia? 
Si rovescia la medaglia
Cambia lo stato mentale stacca la spina al malato terminale
Il paziente è morto, stecchito, sepolto, credimi
Come il paese tra mafia e debiti come la fede
La chiesa e I discepoli dio non vede porche coperto dai satelliti
Lo santi il mala che sale
Si smonta il classismo faccio uguale al telegiornal, psico terrorismo
Io non voglio parlare, sentire, vedere la realtà
Chiedi a Chuck Palahniuk
Scimmia pensa scimmia fa 

Se ne abusi, con sta musica, funziona tipo uzi
Sparo colpi di dolore come glusy
Death music, fire starter
I fantasmi fanno stalker occhi chiusi

Salmo,"Vorrei vedervi morire in fila, vi guardo con mezzo sorriso
In mano un mezzo fondo di tequila
Il piano divino emanda zombie missionari
Per pregare non ti basterebbero I grani dei rosari

No pietà, cuori in pietra la fede nel dito medio amico
Siamo come semi caduti sopra il granito
Un pervertito in sottoveste emana luce celeste,
Ha le spine sulle teste, entro in chiesa col winchester

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene
Per la vita disegnando croci in aria con due dita
E come ti va? Come siete messi
So che la vita è una puttana ho scritto I numeri su tutti I cessi

Piogge di china, aspetto sotto con fogli bianchi 
Prima che tu mi spazzi via col nome di katrina
Prega shiva, brama la mia trama è distruttiva 
Io ho un dio personale dentro un personal di 'bis sativa

No compromessi (no), dagli ciò che chiedono
Registro versi nel telefono sperando che intercettino
Parlo a gesti, alfabeto morse, chi guarda s'incanta
Rovino chi m'ascolta come I doors, nei settanta

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Sogno scheletri e bambini morti sopra le altalene
Dio è morto invano, dio è morto in ogni essere umano
Dio è morto dentro tutte le banche del vaticano

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Tra I morsi delle iene siamo come alice: in catene
Come ti va? Come siete messi
So che la vita è una puttana ho scritto I numeri su tutti I cessi

Vorrei vedervi morire uno sopra all'altro in pila
Se ti sto sul cazzo fai la fila dietro gli ottomila
Prega forte, nessun dorma, la mia salma, prendo forma
Io muoio qua, dentro due passi di libertà

Messo in modo illogico un cristo cianotico
Mi segue con lo sguardo dentro un quadro a effetto ottico
Mi pare sia tutto normale, normale
Come un prete, un minorenne e un abuso sessuale. 

Figli di puttana, mafia cristiana brama, conta la grana
Non vedo se l'occhio sgrana, fumo, l'angoscia mi sbrana
Un timorato pensa a sè, il resto va da sé, perché? 
Fa comodo non sapere, quindi ti dico che

Va tutto bene! Va tutto bene! 
Se crepi tu crepo io, lo faremo insieme
E come ti va? Siamo messi male
Senza sogni, senza fede, niente soldi, niente chiese

Salmo,"Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua!

Parliamo della privacy
Sai, dubito
Hai una chance per andare?
Vai subito
C'hanno visti ma
siamo una canzone intima
da non fare mai in pubblico!
Sanno chi siamo
Sanno che parto e non ti richiamo
Amore tossico
Ama il tuo prossimo
A patto che ti stia lontano
Questa è una trama che conosco già
Lascio che mi deprima
L'amore è un film in testa visto dall'ultima fila
La gente qui ride
Non sa che c'è alla fine
Ogni volta che ti guardo è come vestirmi di spine

Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua

Ora che non vivo coi miei
Ora che ho cambiato città
Capisco chi sei
La parte mancante, l'esatta metà
Conserva paure private
Credo ci sia un doppio fondo
In queste tasche bucate fino alla parte opposta del mondo
Parliamo della privacy? Sai, dubito
Nella gara per l'amore arrivo ultimo
Dalla bara, dalla paranoia chi ama non pensa, mi ama a intuito
Preferisco l'infarto
A vederti piangere quando riparto
È come morire e sapere di averti guardata negli occhi una volta soltanto
Questa è una trama che conosco già
Lascio che mi deprima
L'amore è un film in testa visto dall'ultima fila
La gente qui ride
Non sa che c'è alla fine
Ogni volta che ti guardo è come vestirmi di spine

Dicono che non potrei, dicono che ho il cuore a metà
Scriverti fottuti versi d'amore e il dono dell'ubiquità
Perché potrei vederti ovunque
Negli angoli delle città
Mi basta immaginarti per averti qua",Faraway
Salmo,"La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti
Giovane e vecchio: Benjamin
Batto il tempo, fermami
Si sa che non moriremo finché
Non avrò preso i miei fottuti soldi dalla SIAE

Ah! Messi da parte dai giovani
Ricordati come i vecchi pedofili
Il mio paese è necropoli, morti in piedi aspettando posti più comodi
Sto invecchiando al bancone del bar
Nel mio paese se ammazzi qualcuno diventi una star
In Italia è un dramma, sai, ma
Mi hanno trattato come un cane in Ucraina
Lo stato è critico, ti trovo così invecchiato che potresti fare il politico
La mia pensione è Misery, non devo morire e finire negli inferi
Batto cassa e il beat sfonda-timpani, passo a spallate come in Bitter Sweet Symphony
Morto di vecchiaia d'inverno, un vecchio scemo infermo
Vecchio come il governo
Davanti allo specchio bambini in eterno

La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti

Da qui la vita fa il percorso inverso
Il mio suicidio sarà breve ma intenso
Tutti questi giovani che muoiono per niente
Ai miei tempi era tutto diverso
Troppo vecchio per andare a casa presto
Troppo giovane per stare in arresto
Un Montgomery su Sean Connery vecchio, come gli oneri da pagare presto
Ci rivediamo tra cent'anni con Ron
Senza capelli con il Phon nell'iPhone
Avrò una figlia cicciona di nome Ivonne
Sarò lo stesso buon vecchio Salmolebon
Come se il tempo girasse al contrario, se scocca lo zero si blocca l'orario
Mi ammazzo stanotte stringendo un rosario, perché ho settant'anni e un lavoro precario
È poco ma è il governo
Davanti allo specchio bambini in eterno

La guerra è fuori, svegliati
Stanotte verrò a prenderti

Salmo,"Se rimo fondo il tempo senti il jet-lag

Fingo un mestiere come chi è al call center

Se performo mi trasformo flow daitarn 3
Hardcore black flag giro lo snapback
Chiudo le rime col machete red neck
Hai mai sentito del mio crew?
Forse l'hai sentito da quando non danno più
Il rock alla tv
Sotto shock sotto stress sotto come Loch Ness
Con il mic distorsione sociale, chiamami Mike Ness
No status symbol, sposato con il rap e mai stato single
Facci l'abitudine la gente sa che l'attitudine da cui attingo
E' così forte che, se rimi, mi stai dietro come Paolini e Mingo
Spingo come extra-c sotto casa, gringo que pasa?
Mando m.c. al tappetro e dillo a Rocky Asap
King come Mufasa, fai la muffa a casa
Sempre attaccato alla play, ti sei scordato chi sei?

Siamo in cerca di attenzioni 
Spesso chi le trova finisce a fare I conti

Ricordi sempre il presente anche dopo che tiri le cuoia 
La situazione odierna è che

Salmo,"Se tu fossi me, saresti come loro
No no, nel senso come gli altri
Finiresti per spiarmi da un foro nudo mentre indosso questi panni per lavoro!
Giuro, sono un disoccupato nei suoi anni d'oro.
E il futuro è solo opaco, lasciato in segreteria,
""Play"", farei la fila dei problemi giusto per dire la mia.
Dovrei bruciare tutti i miei vestiti,
Scendere in strada come i travestiti,
Godermi lo spettacolo alla fine del mondo, ci siamo divertiti.
Ma dai! Non può piovere per sempre meteoriti
Non ho bisogno di muovermi, perché sai, magari
Da fermo viaggio in tutto il globo come Salgari.
Ho il rap multitasking e skills palmari,
Quest'erba mette in silenzio in macchina, un safari in bocca.
Tocca a me parlarti, incantarti,
Dirti che i sacrifici pagano in contanti
Questa generazione non crede ai politici o ai Santi,
Credono soltanto ai cantanti!

E se, lo faremo con la punta dei diamanti
È per sentirci importanti quando saremo vecchi.
Ma sai che me ne fotte a me dei soldi?
Io ho solo due motivi e credimi, gli unici.
Il primo è sopravvivere ancora nei tuoi ricordi,
Il secondo è vedervi qui sotto con gli occhi lucidi.
Incontrarci a mezz'aria se qualcosa va storto,
O sono l'aria oppure sono morto (oppure!),
Oppure è la mia stanza che varia e mi fa dormire storto.
Svegliarmi col fiato corto e il tuo fiato sul collo.
Perché il paese è vacuo,
Tagliano i ponti ma sbagliano,
Cammineremo sulle acque con Dynamo,
Verso il nulla come i cani che abbaiano,
Sono felice solo ora che sanguino!

Epico il destino, tu mi sa non sai suonare,
La tua tipa ha il culo a mandolino.
Non eri tu quello che giudica?

Vivi nella paura,
Vedi Massoni nel Triangolo delle Bermuda.
Sento canzoni crepuscolari, Neruda.

Sono il tipo che non ha mai visto Breaking Bad
Voglio solo sparire come Houdini
Attiro l’attenzione, chiamo una canzone Mussoleeni

Poi mi fanno fuori come Mammuccari
Con la TV ci vai a nozze fra’, imbucati
Chiunque faccia il rap adesso ha un pubblico di brufoli
Sei bravo in studio, ma dal vivo mugoli
Ho un pubblico giovane, tu di vecchi storti
I miei crescono con me, i tuoi sono già morti
Sono sempre uguale, stessa fame
Mettimi il fiocchetto, resto sempre un cane
Tra le strade, diglielo a tue madre, brah,  che sono il male

A metà tra mainstream e underground
Quando vado sul palco risveglio James Brown
Scivolo sui gossip, skater, dogtown
Mando knock-out
Haters never log out
Mi sa che vogliono un leader
Uno per tutti, tutti per uno e nessuno che si uccide
Chi muore non decide
Ho un piano infallibile per l’italiani
Puliamoci il culo e baciamo le mani
Ma se oggi ti inculo non è che domani mi chiami e poi dici che mi ami

Voglio solo sparire come Houdini
Voglio solo sparire come Houdini
Voglio solo sparire e fare (uh uh!)
Poi finiamo a testa in giù, Mussoleeni",Mussoleeni
Salmo,"Stupido gioco del rap 
Salmo

S-a-l-m-o lebon
Lord come byron
Nel club con più bombe del cairo
Rap dinamite one shot, tipo vecchia scuola
Lezioni di flow, fai le prevendite e mettiti in coda
Perché sei scarso dal grembo
Nato prematuro quindi già fuori tempo
Salmo ti bastona più del kendo
Fasciati la testa perché quando accendo il mic ti spengo

Ci vado liscio più dell'absolut
Tu contro di me? Una canoa contro un nautilus
Sali su sto flow come sul bus
Nella scena con le skill sono il surplus
Scusa, suca, hasta la muerte e saluta
Ti rimando a casa in un sacco di juta
Sei così brutto che fai quasi brutto
Non puoi mettere naruto contro manuto

Sono dinamite, kryptonite, lex luthor
Mongoloide a te per fare rap ti serve un tutor
Mi stringi la mano e poi fai l'infame
Se fai hardcore non per forza sei un morto di fame
Io con sta merda mi guadagno il pane
Tu sei solo un tossico in giro col cane
Stai abbaiando per paura
Non ti piglio per il culo, ci ha pensato la natura! 

Credimi è una cultura che adesso non c'è
Sai perchè? E' stata uccisa dalla gente come te (come te! )
Che fa la stessa merda da dieci anni
Mettiti una corda al collo e dopo faccio bungee jumping! 
Tu sul beat inciampi, è un guaio
Ti blocco la mascella come un tiro di taglio
Dritto assetto diretto, al tappeto
Sei vecchio da quanto ti sento dormo col secchio affianco al letto! 

Dio, posto mio, meritato
Te non sei la vecchia scuola zio, ti hanno rimandato
Bocciato! mi tocca fare la predica, fare sta merda per me è una passeggiata di domenica! 
Metti il vestito buono, quello preferito
Fatti una sfilata sul tappeto del fallito
Non muori mai ma non sei leggenda
Io ti conosco, tu sei come gianni, un mangia merda

Perdete tempo nel dissing, siamo king come gipsy
Slait fa girare dischi più dei frisbee
Messo a testa in giù come bottiglie di whisky
Siete anonimi alcolisti
Machete empire state of mind, lebon selfmade
Tu sul tempo sei passato, stargate
Manda a casa one take frà
Non te la prendere, è solo lo stupido gioco del rap

Salome Bey,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
Give me your lips for just a moment and my 
Imagination will make that moment live

Salome Leclerc,"Si on partait ensemble
quand se lèvera le vent
on pourrait faire la route
sans bagage

Tu me diras que l'on tangue
je te montrerai comment
on garde l'équilibre en se balançant

Si la nuit cache nos pas
c'est plus plus facile de voir,
Si ma vie porte sa croix
c'est plus facile d'y croire ensemble

Si on nageait ensemble
quand se glaceront les eaux
quand on portera l'hiver sur le dos

Tu me diras que l'on tremble
Moi, je soufflerai les mots
qui réchaufferont la plage de ta peau

Si la nuit cache nos pas
c'est plus facile de voir,
Si ma vie porte sa croix
c'est plus facile d'y croise ensemble.

por mí, no te preocupes.

te llevas contigo

Llenaste de recuerdos
a la ciudad entera
para que de tristeza
poco a poco yo muera.

",Beauty and the Beat
Salt-N-Pepa,"We're on a mission 
Dissin' all of the opposition 
MCs  it's my butt you're kissin' 
Because I desire 

Yo  wait a minute  chill  I want ya all to hear 
Why rap is not a joke  for us it's a career 
Others try to imitate but none has come near 
So you see why everybody stands up and cheer 
And if you really think about it you know what it means 
To be a female rapper from the heart of Queens 
And see others dream about being supreme 
But once on the scene we start killing kings 
People claim we're too wild to tame 
On stage we behave like sizzlin' flame 
And oh, so cool when we rap you need a sweater 
The rhymes so tough you swear they're made of leather 
Get the best of your bunch, and I bet that we're better 
Tell 'em why, Pepa, tell 'em why - 'cause I desire 

DJs come and go just like the wind 
But mine is better than all of them 
She's sharper than a razor when it comes to a cut 
More lethal than a laser if you want to play rough 
Not the object of a show, subject to cut ???? 
????? tell you Spinderella's dope 

Call her Spin for short but she don't take ???? 
want to duel? You're a fool ???? 
Choppin' beats for these until the turntables bleed 
Scratches so damn hard you'd swear the mixer had fleas 
She's the mutilator, music carnivore 
Spinderella rocks the records with a chainsaw 
You're still amazed by the way she plays 
Not a fad but a phase of the hip-hop craze which I desire 

Salt from the Pepa and my name is Cher 
From Queens, New York not Delaware 
I like my steak well-done 'cause I hate it rare 
And I'm lovable and huggable like Yogi the Bear 

Pepa from the Salt so do not rip 
'Cause if you do I'll shift from first to fifth 
Lights out, it's heard, I thought you were dead 
Short, fading went I went upside your head 
So get back to the beat 'cause the beat is bad 
The beat pro and the bass gets much impact 
The beats rock and just because the beat kicks bass 
We're gonna bounce this beat all over the place 'cause I desire 

While you're on the set let the cameras roll 
Salt and Pepa are the stars, the world's the video 
Your room is boomin' when we're on your stereo 
So hold on tight, don't dare let go 
We're the teachers, you're the students - class is in session 

Pay attention boys and girls, and learn your lesson 
We're running things, yes, we're taking over 
You be the grass, we'll be the lawnmower 
Never fakin' or takin', not givin' no slack 
Not trying, succeeding 'cause it's like that 
Hot damn, how could you be so doggone dumb? 
Trying to dis Salt and Pepa when we're number one? 
But we excuse you 'cause you're dippy, your mind's in a daze 
Like every duck you're confused in so many ways 
Giving nothing, taking all whether big or small 

We got a ? beat and it's dope, def y'all 
Every day of the week you're at my beck and call 
You want to try me out? You don't have the gall 'cause I desire",I Desire
Salt-N-Pepa,"Salt and Pepa's back  and we came to out rap you 
So get out my face before I smack you 
Ho  don't you know? Can't you understand? 
If you mess with me I'll take you man 

Well I'll take your man right out the box 
And put him under my padlocks 
So when you see us together chillin' in the place 
Cold walkin' and sportin' him in your face 
Go ahead roll your eyes  suck your teeth 
Keep huffin' and puffin' like a dog in heat 
You can call me a crook, a robber, a thief 
But I'll be your butcher if you got beef 
You know what's up - I ain't no poo-putt 
'Cause Pepa kick butts off dumb, young bucks like you 
And the rest of your crew 

If moms want static I'll dis her, too 
So scram you know who I am 
Damn, chick, don't play me, punk 'cause I'll take your man 

I'll take your man whenever I feel like it 
This ain't a threat or a bet, it's a damn promise 
From me to you, your sex life's through 
If you get another lover, I'll take him, too 
All I have to do is say a rhyme or two 
And he'll hop and leave you like a kangaroo 
I'll make him heel for me even steal for me 
His mother and father he'd kill for me 
That's what you get for trying to play smart 
Now take a hike with that slayed-up heart 
Girl, you don't know if you're comin' or goin'

Psyche is where I win my battles 



I'll handle you like a baby with a rattle 



Don't make me prove to you that I can 



Either give him up or get slammed - I'll take your man 







I'll take your man, that's right but just for spite 



Because you tried to dis me when I was on the mic 



But I really don't want him, the guy ain't fly, shoot 



He can't afford to buy a Fila suit 



Runs the same old gear, never has fresh wear 



What he whispered in my ear I can't repeat here 



I don't want to seem to be so damn mean 



But you're the hippiest critter I ever seen 



Before I got on the stage you wished me good luck 



Turned around and told your friends I suck 



Well look at you now - you ain't got nobody 



Searching for love in a fifth of Bicardi 



You look bad, girl, you look like you're dying 



Ain't no use in crying - I'll take your man 







Yo, Cher, school this fool! 



I'll take your man, your fiancee, your husband 



You ain't Alice, this ain't Wonderland 



And when I say I will you know I can 



Don't mess with me 'cause I'll take your man 







I'll take your man anytime, at the drop of a dime 



'cause he's rappin' and strappin' so hard on mine 



Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look 



The brother's eyein' me down, he's staring down my throat 



But he's a ducker sucker, soft-hearted punk 



Goin' skiing for skeezers, stunts for blunt 



So that's why y'all have so many things in common 



Him for just robbin', you for lap slobbin' 



I never ever went out my way to get played 



Keeping guys like yours held down at bay 



You know I can, I got the upper-hand 



Tramp, you don't stand a chance 'cause I'll take your man 







Most girls have guys that's good to go 



But yours is slow - he's a freakin' a-hole 



The fact still stands, there's no change in plans 



""Yo, Pepa, your wish is my command!"" 



Now you know, you know I'll take your...man 







Check him out, you see what I mean? 



He's leading the pack as the fellas scream 



""Go, Sandy! Get busy! Go, Sandy! Get busy!"" 



It's so easy to make 'em fall for me, Heather 



No man can resist Salt and Pepa 



Because we're perfect from head to toe 



It's not speculation - your man says so 



Revenge is sweet but payback's a trip 



Girlfriend, you won't know which is which 



But I'll tell you this: Don't try to answer this jam 



Because if you do then I'll take your...

To rock y'all, to the beat y'all?
A-keep on and you don't stop
Rockin' on, keep rockin' on

I'm the queen on the mic and it's true when I say that
The Pepa MC is here to stay and you know
If I was a book I would sell

The girl hasn't been born that can deal with I
Me, Sandy D., undoubtably def
Don't need to be dressed, I'm fresh to the flesh
Yes, so tough you know it is a must
Now Salt, get on the mic, and tell 'em why you go crush

'Cause I'm oh-aye, I'm on, I'm on
Yes I'm oh-aye, I'm so damn on
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn
Like a needle on a record when it plays a song
Like Little Boy Blue blowin' on his horn
And you know I got to be on
Mcs rockin' and shockin', but it won't last
Salt's on the mic, and I'm kickin', ask
Me no questions, I'll tell no lies
It's just a little warning, a word to the wise
You been hopin' and scopin', layin' and prayin'
But on the bottom is where you're staying

You're wack, I thought you understood
You're not related to me so you could never be good
I know you come from Babylon (And you know why?)
'Cause you're a Babble-On MC (That's right)
You babble on the microphone about what you wish
But could never be, so please
Don't tell me how you're gonna rock
Don't brag about the things that you ain't got
Don't feed me lies 'cause now I'm full
My cow just died, I don't need your bull

Yo, yo, turn my mic up a little bit
One, two, one, two, alright, thanks

My mic sound nice, check one
My mic sound nice, check two
My mic sound nice, check three

Right about now as you can see
In the place to be
We're not talking about geometry
History or biology
So Sandy D. explained it to me
Why do they call you the Pepa MC?
You mean you don't know? Uh-uh that's a shame
OK Salt, let me explain

I'm hot like a fire, burned down, diminished
Oh, now I see! Chill, let me finish
I wanna make one and all understand
I don't play, I slay when the mic's in my hand
The room temperature reaches a hundred and four
You can scramble eggs on the floor
The pressure soars, the crowd, they roar
Sweat will drip down to your drawers
The Pepa MC is like hot ice
And I paid the price to make the mic sound nice

Forget about the rest, yes, I don't jest
You're blessed with one of America's best
So I think y'all better count your blessings
When Salt's in the house, hell's in session
It's a fact that I will wax
Mcs out there are gonna get taxed
Rockin' to my funky beat
I'm a trip so I know you're gonna fall for me
'Cause this is the year all men fear
Female MCs is movin' up here
Salt and Pepa is strictly biz
You know the color of this, you know what time it is
""Super"" is the strength of the boomin' bass
""Nature"" describes our pretty face
Turning out without a doubt
Make no mistake, Queens is in the house
Yeah, check it out
Ch-check it out",My Mic Sounds Nice

That's true, it's all about money though

Get on now, Cher! Do I have to? Yeah! 







Well I really don't have too much to say 



Yo, then here's my story anyway 



It's just a little somethin' too hot to be missed, girl 



I was going downtown (???), serious 



Cher took the train home from work 



Pissed off because of a stain on my shirt 



The train made a stop (Where?) Two hundred and five 



And a little soft guy walked inside 







He wore plastic Bally's and a booty Gucci suit 



Cracked a little smile and showed a fake gold tooth 



Was he cute? Negative, he was a dupe 



Instead of Polo he wore ???? 



La-di-da-di What? 



La-di-da-di Uh-huh, word to mother 







The boy was rude, I didn't approve 



He tried to make a move I said, ""Stop it, dude!"" 



I started to cuss and began to swear 



He said, ""Listen girl, I like the way you comb your hair 



And I like the stylish clothes you wear 



Is there something that I can do 



To show how much I really care? 



Like when I'm all alone with you 



My heart just skips a beat or two 



And you put that fire inside of me 



That shows it's more than just a dream 



And I like it, and I like it"" 



I said, ""Please, don't get excited!"" 







Don't you know I'm too young for you, mister? 



Sally from the Valley - she's my sister 



And that lady you dissed - that was my mother 



You hurt two of my family, you won't get another 



He tried to deny it, said it was a lie 



He wanted to explain, explain to me why 



I said, ""Don't bother, there's really no need 



Sally died when she hit the concrete"" 



He said, ""Come on, you're puttin' me on"" 



As I got up to walk he sang this song: 







""Oh, baby please don't go 



What must I do to show 



The way I feel for you, girl 



Is going to be real?

Salt-N-Pepa,"Home girls, attention you must pay
So listen close to what I say
Don't take this a simple rhyme
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time
Now what would you do if a stranger said hi?
Would you dis him or would you reply?
If you answer there is a chance
That you'd become a victim of circumstance
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove
You are what you are, I am what I am
It just so happens that most men are

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude?
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood
I know a guy like that, girl
He thinks he's God's gift to the world
You know that kind, excited all the time
With nothing but sex on the mind
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front
I know the real deal, I know what they want
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer
But on a real tip I think he's a

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

On the first date he thought I was a dummy
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me
But of course, I knew it was a lie, y'all
He undressed me with his eyeballs
Trying to change the whole subject
'Cause everything he said pertained to sex
So I dissed him, I said, ""You's a sucker!
Get your dirty mind out the gutter
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots
You ain't treating me like no prostitute""
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser
You're on a mission, kid yo, he's a

The mic will sing soon as I touch it
Do this smooth and easy like
So we might get hyped in here tonight
Be nice, relax, MC's further back
If you ain't with that, I'm-a have to attack you with a bad rap
That can smack the smile off your face Jack
So don't start no crap
Givin' a little bit of heart and soul
As we do it to you in your earhole
Huh, I ain't going out like a sucker
And if you think so, boy, then pucker up
And kiss the butt of this lyricist
Blow on the mic and make a wish

Spinderella my DJ's a turntable trooper
My partner Pepa she's a power booster
Word to life, I swear, she'll seduce ya
Don't take my word, I'll introduce her
I don't need no introduction, I just bust in
Grab a microphone and then start dustin'
So-called lyricists can never deal with this
Swift-lipped vocalists either and also if
I was a mute, I'd still knock boots
Put up your dukes, troop, and I'm-a play ya like a flute
To show you all on me you can't sleep on
Spinderella, please drop some beats on
This crowd, pump it up loud
Gimme a scratch, OK now
It's time for hell to be raised
As I kick some lyrics on the beats Hurb made
Salt's at my side with a shotgun
A little action? I just had some
Wicked I say, the girl don't play
Gonna skip town on Judgement Day
So don't just sit there like a poo-putt stupid

I'm not gonna waste your time on the strength, I'll be
Def, dumb, dope, completely phenominal
You didn't know? Yeah, right, come on now
Oh, I'm supposed to believe E-M-C-E-E's
Are glad Salt is makin' G's?
Save that crap, I got my public to rap to
Tried to play me out, I ought to slap you, punk
For being disrespectful
I grip the microphone like a pitbull terrier
Yes, but I'm scarier
Under a ton of rhymes I'll bury ya
Hyped like a poet, on the mic I'll show it
Do-re-mi fa-so-la ti-do it
Jazz, rhythm, blues, soul, pop, rock 'n roll, even hip-hop
Lovers, are my brothers and sisters
All in all over ten billion listeners
Lend me your ear when you want to hear
The hypest and ripest sound of the year

I'd like you to meet my mic  last name is phone 
This is my house make yourself at home 
Now see those chairs? Please just ignore them 
Believe me  they'll be no need for them 
I got a rhyme  and I'd like to exploit it 
You came in here so you cannot avoid it 
This beat is hard  it's as hard as atomic energy 
Thinkin' as long as we're rhymin' to it 
And it's addictive like smoking 
Word to the parents, see, I'm not jokin' 
You'd be a thief only this life is harmless 
Couldn't kick the habit if you tried your darndest 
So don't fight it, don't fear it 
Just take your hands, applause and cheer it 
I gave you more than you ever expected 
And when I did then you gave me respect 
With your support we're reachin' new heights 
Salt and Pepa's insanely hyped on the mic 

My supporters are massive, my sound is passive 
If I was you, I'd take time to ask if 
Others you've heard really deserve to be ranked as the best 
Great or supurb, to be or not to be, that's a good question 
How good they used to be, well I give less than a damn 
'cause the present day counts if you can't rock a tone 
I suggest you just count 
I said please, but it's not like I'm pleadin' 
So don't get supe, peasant, stop speedin' 
'cause I'm about to rain, and when I rain I don't drizzle 
It's gettin' hot in here, we're gonna sizzle 
See, I understand that you had the dishes 
But if it's too hot, get out of the kitchen 
'cause frauds and fakes are the ones I don't like 
And they are the ones that get me hyped on the mic 

I'm gonna play you for keeps, got a system in my teeth 
Outside on the street people heard all of the beats 
That I rapped or mastered so throw the wax on 
Pepa is that strong, they can hear the last song 
First class status, I'm a blessed event 
God rocked the full-size for my silhoutte 
Yes, solo this woman, rise all before me 
??? jump on it 
Don't try to be 'cause I will protest 
Oh yes, I have an uzi I've been dyin' to test 
Livin' larger than life but to be precise 
I'm Pepa, much deffer when I'm crazy hyped on the mic 

We're gonna break it down to you how it should be broke 
Rhymes written not ? and how it should be wrote 
People jammin' not standin' and what you hope 
A show funky not junky, you say rhymes are dope 
??? he'd be madly hyped 
Spinderella had to tell him, ""Boy, you ain't my type"" 
Get away from her, I tell you before she gets pissed 
She's got a left with a cut, and it'll go like this 

Started wheelin' doin' wheelies, but you were a big wheel 
Started dealin' like a dealer, but you just couldn't deal 
As you flip like a freak the whole world just flopped 
Couldn't rock like a rocker so you just got rocked 
I'm the defest gettin' deffer and ought to be kept 
Take a breath between rhymes with a bet, tell 'em Pep 
Or let's kick it like a kicker, the rhymes I kick 
Like a sticker gets stuck to your butt I'll stick 
When the hype is gettin' hyper, when the hip-hop's hype 
Salt and Pepa, that's right, you know we're hyped on the mic

Salt was rockin' the hell out of some of you cats 



Then I decided to slow down the tempo 



To let you catch your breath so 



Just wait for the drumroll then you can feel the flow of 







Syncopated soul power 



Got to have syncopated soul power 



All you need is syncopated soul power 



Yeah  gimme some soul power 



Everybody needs soul power 







I'm the Pepa, much deffer 



Half-stepper? No, I'm never 



World renowned as a vocalist 



When Salt is not around I'm a soloist 



Puttin' pep in your step seriously 



Conquest is the best lyrically 



The mic is a component I use on my opponents 



Only to flaunt it, it just sound good, don't it? 



Rhyme power, organic as a sunflower 







And full of soul power 



All I got is sycopated soul power 



All you need is sycopated soul power 



Cold kickin' soul power 



Steady kickin' soul power 









Now raise your hands and keep 'em there for a minute 



I'm gonna tell you what to do with it 



Wave it like a flag, dirty rag 



Keep 'em there till they get jet lag 



Pepa's on the mic, and the mic is on 



If Salt's at my side, nothing can go wrong 



Meet the mix empress, Spinderella, head on 



And that, my friend, is the meaning of a rap song 



Keep your shirt on, don't lose the buddies 



If I ain't done rappin' yo, Spin, keep cuttin' 



Ain't nothin' gonna stop us now 







We on a roll with syncopated soul power 



Got to have syncopated soul power 



All you need is syncopated soul power 







Soul power, soul power 



Soul power, soul power...",Solo Power (Syncopated Soul)
Salt-N-Pepa,"When the needle's picked up the volume's kicked up 
She's gonna fix up anything that's mixed up 
When the record gets cut the crowd is lift up 
You might think it is but... 

[Chorus:] 
Spinderella's not a fella what you say? 
Spinderella's not a fella that's ok 
Spinderella's not a fella watch her play 
Spinderella's not a fella but a girl DJ 

Spins you won't get 
And flip the vocal style, rip the instrumental 
Nice on a slice, swift on a mix 
Those who dis will then be dismissed 
Like a fever she'll heat up, burn, and feed her 
If you can't put up then shut the hell up 
All you mixmasters and cutmasters 
True grandmasters even jammasters 
Listen to what I'm sayin' on the mic 
She's hard as a man, too sexy for a dyke 
So let your ears hear what your mind can't conceive 
Got a cut for your butt on the mix why'all she's no joke 
With the microphone you're toast 
Get ya hyped and excite, mysterious as a ghost 
Check the style plus the swiftness 
Don't take my word for it, you be the witness 
No one lies when the truth is starin' them in the mouth 
The needle won't stick, it's the record they hug 
No alibis 'cause the proof is in the puddin' 
Mistakes on hip-hop breaks? She's just wouldn't 
Make believe what she can do indeed 
You're dealing with the Queen of Speed 
Cuttin' the beats with ease, makin' the record bleed 
Now then, you know what I mean... 

[Chorus:]
 
She's the inch long on the mixboard 
Put your tape on pause and press record 
Never does the same cut twice in one night 
She'll go solo toe-to-toe like a vice 
Grip the turntable and flip the record over 
Heat up the party like a supernova 
Because it's a girl don't mean jack 
If Jill tried to get ill, she'd get slapped 
Want to know her name and why she came? 
Not to cause trouble but to entertain 
I'm-a tell ya don't mistake her for a fella 
The mix empress...Spinderella! 

Yeah, that's her title 
The God of Speed is her DJ idol 
Cuttin' like a maniac, clever as a brainiac 
Only when the scene's packed will she react to 
Anyone who dares to compare 
The comp will be too much too bear 
But this chick is big on tricks 
With her wrist she'll flip within a spilt 
Second, she's flexin' and checkin' 
The level of the power meter will not be less than 
Ten degrees, her sound won't distort 
Mixin' ain't a job to her it's a sport 
When the turntable speaks, take your advice 
My homegirl is nicer than nice 
She's a ?, a slave to the rhythm 
If the crowd wants action then she'll give 'em 
More than they can handle, this ain't a scandal 
If the mix is mangled she'll untangle 
It with a scratch on it, ain't that a bit? 
The way she can switch from groove to groove 
With no room to improve [yeah, I'm telling you] 

[Chorus:]
 
Cuts are made to be played not fade 
Spin won't behave if she ain't paid 
To get down, no let down 
Put your bets down and just check how 
She moves with the grace of a cat being pat 
The wax hits hard as a bat 
Automated just like automation 
Imitation causes irritation 
You owe it to yourself to see her 
Go backstage and meet her 
Get her autograph, take a photograph 
I know that's too much to ask 
Word, but don't give up hope 
Spinderella's not a fella, Spinderella's dope 

[Chorus:]",Spinderella's Not a Fella (But a Girl D.J.)
Salt-N-Pepa,"You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

[Chorus]
Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
'Cause if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
'Cause I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you tolerated me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

[Chorus]

Who me? A tease? Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

Salt-N-Pepa,"Oh yeah, oh yeah
You know life is all about expression
You only live once, and you're not coming back
So express yourself, yeah

Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body

Now Joe want to be like Bob
Bob got it goin' on with no job
And everything Rob got he got from Robin
And everything she got she got ho-hoppin'
My girl Jilly want to be like Jackie
Fat rope chains and I think that's wick-wacky
Tom and Dick want to be like Harry
Little do they know he's bitin' on Barry
Stan was a scam, but Vinnie's legit
Mercedes coupe hometroop with no kit
A businessman with a beeper for a reason
Not like Tim because it's in this season

Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body

Hey Pep, you up next

Yes, I'm Pep and there ain't nobody
Like my body, yes, I'm somebody
No, I'm sorry, I'm-a rock this Mardis Gras
Until the party ends, friends
Yes, I'm blessed, and I know who I am
I express myself on every jam
I'm not a man, but I'm in command
Hot damn, I got an all-girl band
And I wear the gear, yeah, I want to wear it, too
I don't care, dear, go ahead and stare (oooo)
Afraid to be you, livin' in fear (boo)
Expression is rare, I dare you

Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body

Oh yeah, oh yeah...
Yo, excuse us while we rap
Go ahead, girls, express yourself!

My party, your party, anytime drop in
Cold hip-hop is always rockin'
Don't you like it when the music drop
Jump, spread out, and stop?
Now bring in the go-go (uh-oh)
Look at how my butt go rock from left to the right
You want to step to me, groove me
I know you want to do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight

At my door they're bum-rushin'
To hear the percussion
Sound of my go-go band
I've long ago learned my lesson
It's all about expression
Will the real Salt and Pepa please stand?
And

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, come on and work that body

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe

Salt-N-Pepa,"When duty call, the leader Pep come hard
Try to dis my girl Salt, up goes my guard
Still feminine, feminine still, yes
But then next pump a hundred weight bench press
So what it mean, Pep? I'm not impressed
'Cause I wear the pants, and you wear the dress
Punk, you're lovin' stunk, you're not a hunk
This is independent funk

And I'm gettin' ready for the year 2000
Independent, yes, I'm housin'
Independent, yeah, now watch me
Independent, no one can stop me

Woman and I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk
Yeah, can you feel it?
Yes, it's my, it's my independent funk

(Yawn) You're sleepy, go to bed
Want to step? Go ahead and jet
Now wake up from your dreamin' 'cause you're dealin' with the Pep
Like Oakley from the Knicks, yes, I'm havin' a ball
You think because you're leaving that I'm gonna take a fall?
It was small thing, oh, it was really too small
Livin' large, boy, standing ten feet tall
Now my heart won't dent, keep the money I lent
And don't forget I pay the rent, this is my apartment
I'm independent

I am independent
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk
Hey

Salty the V.I.P., you should have stuck with me
What are you stupid? Huh, my pockets run deep
So flex the Rolex and the sex that I gave ya
In jail with no bail and now nothin' can save ya
You want me to visit? I ain't with it lizard
We had magic now ya lost without the love wizard
Ya had to cross me, and now you lost me
Get off me softy, I'm the boss, see?
You can't disguise the lies in your eyes, you're not a heart breaker
You're a fraud, and I'm bored, you're a fake faker
It's too late to debate with the moneymaker
After while, crackhead, see ya later, gator

Woman and I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk
Yeah, so funky, so funky

No, no, no more nookie for you 'cause I gave ya the boot
Go ahead and go in your Yugo, gonna miss the Benz Coupe, home troop
Who's supportin' ya now?
Got a job or do ya rob? I heard you're sellin' drugs, wow
Big man, huh? But just understand Uncle Sam know the scam
You'll end up in the can
Singin' a sad song 'cause you did me wrong
Couldn't fool me for long, I got it goin' on
I'm independent

Yes, I am independent
That's right I said it, and be damn sure I meant it
'Cause a girl like me can have anybody
So give my love, boy, to my independent funk
Hey yeah, my independent funk
It's just an independent funk
Get with this independent funk

You're a baby so maybe you just needed a babysitter
Bitter? I figure I'm rid of a piece of litter
Tiger, tigger, I bounce back, and you're a quitter
Your girl is gone for good so just forget her
You're blind, you'll never find another better
Your mind stays on a behind in a tight sweater
Burned your flowers and your love letters
Never a tear will I shed
I'm independent

Yes, I am independent
I make my own money so don't tell me how to spend it
'Cause you need me, and I don't need you
So listen close, boy, to my independent funk

Salt-N-Pepa,"CHORUS
Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope
 
Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (come on)
Let's talk about sex (do it)
Let's talk about sex (uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex
 
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies - let's talk about sex, all right
(repeat)
 
[Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
And why not? Everybody has sex
I mean, everybody should be makin' love

You know what I'm sayin'? 
Phat rings (always) thick gold chains (whatever) know what I'm sayin'? 
I even got gold on my teeth (So what?) 
You a tramp (Please...)] 

Home girls attention you must pay 
So listen close to what I say 
Don't take this a simple rhyme 
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time 

Now what would you do if a stranger said hi? 
Would you dis him or would you reply? 
If you answer there is a chance 
That you'd become a victim of circumstance 

Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth 
Or else I'm-a have to show and prove 
You are what you are, I am what I am 
It just so happens that most men are... 

Tramp (What'd ya call me?) 
[Yeah, I'll be your tramp (Please...)] 
Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude? 
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood 

I know a guy like that, girl 
He thinks he's God's gift to the world 
You know that kind, excited all the time 
With nothing but sex on the mind 

I'm no stunt, on me he can't front 
I know the real deal, I know what they want 
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy 
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!) 

'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer 
But on a real tip I think he's a... 
Tramp (What'd ya call me?) 
[This is gettin' riduculous 
Don't waste my time] 

On the first date he thought I was a dummy 
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me 
But of course, I knew it was a lie, why'all 
He undressed me with his eyeballs 

Trying to change the whole subject 
'cause everything he said pertained to sex 
So I dissed him, I said, ""You's a sucker! 
Get your dirty mind out the gutter 

You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots 
You ain't treating me like no prostitute"" 
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser 
You're on a mission, kid - yo, he's a... 

Tramp (What'd ya call me?) 
[Why you gotta be all that? 
Why you gotta be all that? 
I'm tryin' to talk to you, and you're tryin' to dis me 

You know what I'm sayin'? 
Now if I rolled on you, I'd be wrong, right?

Pepa MC  and her first born  whatever it may be] 



Yo  Spin  once again help me get this crowd on its feet 

So we can set it off 

I've got your back  Salt  you know I'm never soft 

Yo  where's your records at? 

Right beside me 

Ready to give a scratch? 

Yep  like poison ivy 



It's the Nineties  the year for change  can you prove it? 

I made this beat  I'm an Invincible, and I produced it 

It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control 

Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick 

Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list 

'cause I can be a witch if 

They music is cool, and it can calm the savage beast 

Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat 

A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact 

Take out the camera, Salt, (Why?) I want to picture that 

Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed 

Before I cut up a jam I yell a ""hocus pocus"" 

And right before your eyes you'll understand the name 

Musicans and magicians are usually the same 

And the fame, proclaim, obtains, the stain will gain a rain 

That pours, it soars my brain to yours 

Ordained by law to train the poor 

I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more 

It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men 

Magic will only work for those who do believe in them 



Black magic, it's black magic 

Do you believe in black magic? 

It's black magic 

I believe in black magic 

It's black magic 

Do you believe in black magic? 

It's black magic 

I believe in 



We call this song ""Black Magic"" 'cause it's a fact 

Anything that's tragic relates to black 

Coincidental? (No) Here's an example, Jack 

Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts 

Black Sunday or Monday 

Black tongues or lungs may cause a black sleep 

Why say black sheep? 

Black sabbath is evil, black market illegal 

A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy 

See, some try to say dark-skinned men ain't sexy true 

Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice 

Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life 

Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light 

Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall 

My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all

And the life that I live is black magic 

Anything that I give is black magic 



It's black magic 

Do you believe in magic? 

It's black magic 

I believe in 



In magic, a dimension of sight and sound 

Where people see in only shades of brown 

And reality is the same as a fantasy 

Is this the way you want your world to be? 

Not me, I want variety in my society 

Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see 

This is a woman speakin' bringin' door-to-door, seekin' 

Tranquilty, that abilty will keep on repeatin' 

To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat 

Making them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique 

Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya 

You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh, I proved you wrong 

Over ten years and still goin' strong 

Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long?

Salt and Pepa now we're back and again featuring 
Spinderella, she's not a fella but a pro 
And on the wheels of steel good to go 
Cuttin' up a storm sometimes it's frightning 
First comes the rain then strike the lightning 
Doper than dope, can anyone cope? 
Yes, a-maybe, ahh - nope, so why do you persist and try? 
Look me right in the eye and tell me are you that fly? 
That you can pick up the microphone 
We stake the mic alone 
Hope that you never run into Salt and Pepa 
'cause we're doper than dope 

Yo, it's been a long time, but now we're back 
Salt and Pepa's gettin' funky on a brand new track 
And more up-to-par, swift like a car 
Stickin' to your mouth like rooftop tar 
Leaving a scar on those who spar 
So pass the cigar, get a drink from the bar 
Lyrics gonna flood your mind like the reservoir 
Here they are, come and join the Salt and Pepa seminar 
The rhymes are refined, some call them bizarre 
But they can catch your ears like a bass guitar 
And speakin' of base, why did ya in the first place? 
Walkin' around town till I see you face to face 
You didn't want to speak so I rested my case 
And now you're feelin' kinda fragile like an antique vase 
But don't worry friends or even give up hope 
'cause this time we're hyper than hype on the mic 
Call us doper than dope 

Spinderella, where ya at? 
Give us a funky scratch 
This is it, this is it 
Gettin' doper than doper than dope can get 
Uh, hit me 
Two times 

Three-two-one break down, ya broke up 
'cause you started speakin' when you shouldn't have spoke up 
You went the wrong way, you shouldn't have tried 
To dis Salt and Pepa 'cause half-steppers gettin' fried 
'cause these females at five minutes a beat 
Is all it takes for us to take control seven days a week 
You're wack, stick to your skeezin' please 
And let's not waste time on the weak MCs 
'cause they're unreal, and we're the real deal 
'cause we reveal the real sex appeal 

Yo, fellas, you want some, come and get some 
Doper than dope rhymes so I can hit some 
Musical notes that can hypnotize 
Keep your eyes on the lips, hips, and thighs 
Try to concentrate on the whole scenery 
'cause this is Salt and the Pepa MC 
Yo, here to rock right with the Idolmakers clan 
There's Steevee-O, Hurby the Luv Bug and also 
The Invincibles, Fat Doug, Dre, and Bougie 
And much more so get your VCR and pick my Fuji tape 
And rush for your house, don't move slow 
'cause you might miss the main Idols in the video 
You guessed it, yes, it's no joke 
Salt and Pepa's on the mic gettin' (what?) 
Gettin' doper than doper than doper than dope 

Enough (Why?), 'cause this ain't your average stuff 
And when it comes to rockin' rhymes Salt and Pepa don't bluff 
We were the Showstoppers that took your men 
We made you shake it then you push it, and we started a trend 
But this trend is kinda different, it's not a gold rope 
This time it's Salt and Pepa, Spinderella gettin' doper than dope

Yo, if you walk out on me, I'll understand 

And have to take my lumps like a man

As the smoke clears you can hear 

And the ringing in your ears just disappears 

Your body's soft, but you still want more 

You might end up as a casualty on the dance floor 

I'm an addict, strung out on dopeness 

But you can't chew, sniff, or smoke this 

If you want to get high step by the speaker 

And overdose on somethin' sweeter 

Do you suffer from migranes or other pains 

That's caused by stress and strain? Brother, refrain 

You came to the right place to get your head straight

Oh, I feel hot then again why not 

This ain't pop, it's hip-hop 

And got a lot to rock to, dip and dop to 

You don't have to, but you probably want to 

It makes you laugh because it's really fun to 

Twist your tongue and exercise your lungs to 

Tonight on the mic we're showing 

We're strong enough for a man, but made for a woman 

Hey you! Where do you think you're goin'? 

Yo, Stan, my man, keep the horns blowin' 

Havin' a good time ain't no crime 

When the joint is jumpin' and people are dancin' 

Everyone does it, now it's no sin 

Yo, I just did it, and I'm ready to do it again and again and again

Some of this funky groove we got here 

You ain't got to throw no solo in, brother 

Just keep what ya got 

Yo, turn it loose 'cause it's a mutha

What are you stupid? Huh, my pockets run deep 
So flex the Rolex and the sex that I gave ya 
In jail with no bail and now nothin' can save ya 
You want me to visit? I ain't with it lizard 
We had magic now ya lost without the love wizard 
Ya had to cross me, and now you lost me 
Get off me softy, I'm the boss, see? 
You can't disguise the lies in your eyes - you're not a heartbreaker 
You're a fraud, and I'm bored - you're a fake faker 
It's too late to debate with the moneymaker 
After while, crackhead - see ya later, gator

Got a job or do ya rob? I heard you're sellin' drugs - wow 
Big man, huh? But just understand Uncle Sam know the scam

Bitter? I figure I'm rid of a piece of litter 
Tiger, tigger, I bounce back, and you're a quitter 
Your girl is gone for good so just forget her 
You're blind, you'll never find another better 
Your mind stays on a behind in a tight sweater 
Burned your flowers and your love letters 
Never a tear will I shed 
I'm independent

Salt-N-Pepa,"Here we go, I'm a Negro with an ego
(Yo)
So, don't tell me what I'm doin' is illegal
No, I resort to violence only when provoked
Contrary to rumors I'm no joke

If I sound hard it's because I'm peed off
And do you wanna know why? Go 'head tell 'em Salt
All right, let me explain what upset me
No we ain't tryin' to be sexy

Dismiss is quick with a miss like a tongue
'Cuz I'd run if I was a chick
Pick up a hit list
And I'm-a kick it like this

The word is out, you played me out
I won't scream and shout, straighten it out now
Don't lie and spy, stop tryin' to connive me
Slow your roll, you don't even know me

I'm not a militant but I'm equivalent
To an activist, all I'm after is cheer among all
I don't care if they're big or small, short or tall
We've got to stand to fall, ain't that right, y'all?

Now all I can talk about is what I know
And all I know about is what I witness
What I witness is what I see
Me, way below status quo 'cuz I'm a Negro with an ego
Yo, that don't go

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

I'm black and I'm proud to be a
African-American Soul Sister
Usin' my mind as a weapon, a lethal injection
And oh yes, I'm the best in whatever I do

I do better, I'm clever
I never half-step ask Salt or Pepa
We're partners in rhyme, one of a kind
This affair is rare and you will never find
Another like me, gimme the mic, it's mine

Keep your mitts off this, yo, Salt, it's time
To let the public know the subject of the show
Is what America calls a Negro with an ego
Yo, that don't go, that's a negative so

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

Porche, Benz and BM's are all suitable
For people who sell pharmaceutical
That's a stereotype, that's the hype
Don't ask me why I have an attitude
(All right)

When I drop a nine-eleven on my 200C
The cops are surprised to see, a minority
Behind the wheel of this car, it must be narcotics
How else could she have got it?

A brown-skinned female with two problems to correct
Wrong color, wrong sex
Sometimes I feel the real deal is to be a rebel
But that would bring me down to their level

I won't settle for that, it's unacceptable
'Cuz Salt-N-Pepa's always very respectable
Sometimes we get crazy and outta hand
But it's all in the fun of makin' everybody dance

I'm proud of
Who and what I am
So call me a Negro with an ego
And get ready to go blow for blow

Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race
Put some faith in your race

Faith, faith
Faith, faith
Faith, faith

Salt-N-Pepa,"I'm gettin' dressed for the jam about to jump in my Mercedes 

Slippin' on my dancin' shoes 'cause I'm a lady of the eighties 

It's Friday night  I just got paid  my house is pumpin' 

Or listenin' to my Hammer tape  while my sound system is dumpin' 

Picked up my girl Salty  she was waitin' on the porch 

I shared my fly  fly Mercedes  yo  lit the highway like a torch 

On the way to pick up Spindy we raced with a 1 9 D 

He was a sucker duck if he thought he could buck with us in E 

The party started 



CHORUS 

Let's get this party started 

Let's get this party started right 



Rolled up at the party, saw a fella black and fine 

Bow-legged, high-top fade, then I said, ""Yo, that one's mine"" 

Stepped out of the ride, told the bouncer, ""Hold my Benzy"" 

Heard the bass, it was the place so I slipped my man a penny 

When we walked in the jam fans met us at the door 

They yelled, ""We love you Salt and Pepa!"" ""Yes, we love y'all even more!"" 

Some foul, wack, nappy bitty tried to step to Spinderella 

I was cool, I made my move, then I droppped her like a fella 

Start the party, boy 



CHORUS 



Now this is what you call a hip-hop beat from S and P 

So get out on the dancefloor, and don't even rough with me 

I ain't goin' for it, I ain't buyin' it so don't even try me 

Dance sucker, Mother Tucker can, that old lady gets busy 

Yeah, I don't give a damn, Salty is who I am 

And man, I'm gonna slam this jam, you understand? 

Yes, we will stay the queens no matter what the means 

The party started, let's get retarded, now work them bluejeans 

Rock the party, y'all

[Yo, Salt, you want to continue the story?] 

Yes, I told the people move, he made a move 

To the stage and grabbed the mic 

From these stank, sorry, frauds - Run D.M.C. look-alikes 

Spinderella took the set, made her fingers nice and wet 

And you bet she made that DJ sweat, and he won't soon forget 

Pepa took on the speaker, bust an oh, so funky rhyme 

I did a step right on time and made the crowd lose their minds 

The whole place was on the floor, we was rockin' hardcore-core 

We left them wantin' more, and we headed out the door 

We rocked the party

Then get the heck out 
Put on your battlin' gear  but don't come strapped 
Bullets are not needed  this time it's rap for rap 
I'm makin' the move  and soon you'll have to make yours back 
In fact  the further the rhyme is dancin'  Jack will get a lip smack 
So break up because it's time you shook up  you gotta make up 
It's time to break up the party  now you're shook up 
Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift, livin' up to par 
And competition, how to ""Whassup"" is to ride the bra strap 
Hurby's on the beats, Steevee-O has the musical notes 
Spinderella's like a propeller spinnin' music so dope 
Makin' a lot of noise for all the boys shootin' the gift 
Hold on tight 'cause tonight Salt and Pepa's gettin' swift 

You might have thought about goin' against the spices 
Salt and Pepa's a mixture like Chinese rices 
Battlin' time, Mr. Macho, please don't try to rip 
Because I'll melt ya like Nacho cheese 
You want flavor, well here's something to savor 
Why don't you wave a microphone in front of my face 
And a do small favor, gimme a beat so I can bust a rhyme 
For all the nerds, let all the words feed your mind 
Statin' the things and pleasin', takin' a rest, I'm out for easin' 
Bodily functions makin' 'em dance and Pep, this is the Christmas season 
This is duck season, and I'm gettin' high 
You're outta luck, duck, now it's time for you to get and die 
The ebony queens are back on the scene 
I assume you still suck like a vacuum machine 
Cornball sucker, give me a break 
I'm-a drop you from the sky like snow, you a cornflake 
Born to break any sucker or half-stepper 
Who wants to get assaulted with a deadly pepper 
Go down, low-down, this ain't no showdown 
The competition, I'm sure they'll blow down 
Even if you seem to stand stiff 
The breeze of the rhyme makes you move, and we get swift 

Suckers and flukes, it seems you lost and time to put up dukes 
'Cause you just forced it, the furious females to fly to (fuck) with 
Stay stiff suckers, soon you'll be stuck with a rep, torn to shreds 
A musical score leg, need a victory? I left an 'S' on your forehead 
Don't fuse up now, it's time to put out lights 
I won't ease up, pal, 'cause I'm-a go outta sight 
Lyrical queen, mess around, and you'll get creamed 
The star of every male's fantasy or wetdream 
The ebony princess in a lyrical safari 

Battlin' me is like a Honda racing a Ferrari 
If you were the king, what laws would you have me obey? 
None, my son, 'cause I'm quicker than a ??? 
Quick to split the chick tryin' to get slick 
You're nothing but a prostitute turning a new trick 
Little Miss Wench, my mind is a trench 
Makes you drop, then you stop in your tracks and as I clench 
My fist, I twist words you use to rip 
The next time you flex, I'm guaranteed to get swift 

Hip-hopper's, rap artists, and rhyme fanatics 
Can you believe there's a sucker trying to cause static? 
Break out the health supplies and medical aid 
Prepare your mind for a super, alphabetical raid 
Rhythmic explosion without corrosion 
Rhymes, in effect, that protect like a Trojan 
Against disease, sorta like a wack MC 
Rhymes more powerful than a punch at Jack Dempsy 
I fear no one, plus I tell no tales 

I will stand up to any male or female 
Ones who persist to resist end up a prisoner 
Hissed in a daze or a faze because he is in a 
State of shock, too hard for one to take 
So in a multitude of crowds I run to break 
Beats for torture, but don't get played 
I stay paid, I caught ya now you shook, you're afraid 
Scared of the fact we came back to uplift 
The name, we designed the game, and we get swift",Swift
Salt-N-Pepa,"Magic, I'd like to send this one out to the partner
Pepa MC, magic, and her first born, whatever it may be, magic
Yo Spin, once again help me get this crowd on it's feet

So we can set it off, I've got your back, Salt
You know I'm never soft, yo where's your records at?
Right beside me, ready to give a scratch? Yep, like poison ivy

It's the nineties, the year for change, can you prove it?
I made this beat, I'm an invincible and I produced it
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick

Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list
'Cuz I can be a witch if, they say music is cool
And it can calm the savage beast
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat

A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact
Take out the camera, Salt, why? I wanna picture that
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed
Before I cut up a jam I yell a 'Hocus Pocus'

And right before your eyes you'll understand the name
Musicians and magicians are usually the same
And the fame, proclaim, obtains the stain, will gain a rain
That pours, it soars my brain to yours

Ordained by law to train the poor
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more
It's a treachery hidden up the sleeves of men
Magic will only work for those who do believe in them

Black magic, it's black magic, do you believe in black magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic, it's black magic
Do you believe in black magic? It's black magic, I believe in

We call this song 'Black Magic' 'cuz it's a fact
Anything that's tragic relates to black
Coincidental? No, here's an example, Jack
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts

Black Sunday or Monday, black tongues or lungs
May 'cause a black sleep, why say black sheep?
Black Sabbath is evil, black market illegal
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy

See, some try to say dark skinned men ain't sexy, true
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light

Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in magic

And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic
And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic

It's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in

In magic, a dimension of sight and sound
Where people see in only shades of brown
And reality is the same as a fantasy
Is this the way you want your world to be?

Not me, I want variety in my society
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see
This is a woman speakin', bringin' door-to-door, seekin'
Tranquility, that ability will keep on repeatin'

To saw someone in half may be a trick or treat
Makin' them dance and laugh is somethin' quite unique
Abracadabra, Salt's comin' at ya
You say my music was a phase, a fad, huh

I proved you wrong, over ten years and still goin' strong
Whoever heard of a fad kickin' for so long?

Magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic? It's black magic
I believe in magic, it's black magic, do you believe in magic?
It's black magic, I believe in black magic

And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic
And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic

And the life that I live is black magic
Anything that I give is black magic
And my feet in the street is black magic
And my soul in control is black magic

Salt-N-Pepa,"I'm a sister with a grip on her life 
I only live once so I gotta get right 
The first time 'cause there won't be a second 
I'm not in the mood to preach about the wrong of the world 
It can't be changed by three girls 
On the trio tip we're not a proof of that trip 
Excuses that's the truth when the proof compellin' 
I ain't tellin' or sellin' out to the pop life 
I like the spotlight 
Gimme a mic and a beat so I can speak words of wisdom 
I may be young, feed some, fall down, and filled up, I'm gonna build up 
Knowledge is food for thought so let's eat up 
Whatever goes up, comes down, you see nothin' lasts forever 
Not even MCs, you, he, she, and even I should live and let live 
Or live and let die 

Live and let die 
You're wastin' time tryin' to change the mind 
Of those who's souls are full of holes 
I do unto others as I wish them to do unto me 
Life ain't nothin' but death without money 
My way of thinkin' is one-track 
My method of convincin' combat 
Success is a mission, it's there for anyone who wants to do better 
You know where I'm comin' from 
Survival of the fittest, and I'll admit it's vicious 
I testify as a witness 
Let me say this first for what it's worth 
It's true that the meek shall inherit the earth 
But that don't mean you gotta be weak or soft 
Even on the mic you can't take no shorts 
I only help those who want to help themselves if no one else 
As a youngster they taught me to live and let live 
And that's what I always did, word to miz 
But there's a change in the world that I live in 
So don't be surprised if I live and let die 

Live and let die 
Live and let die 

That's the eighth time that baser almost O.D.'d, man 
Live and let die 
Yo, Finster, baby, went up for homicide 
Live and let die 
He's out there skeezin' with no jimmy hat 
Live and let die 
K-bone was shortin' the fuzz and got dumped

Up and down the block just ain't my thang

Cause either AIDS or jail will get that ass, honey

Now in 1993, I'm livin' mack stack 
Check my attitude it comes with the territory, baby 
And now I'm drivin' niggas crazy

Everybody wants to get paid, paid like a Lou Mays 
Poppin' that coochie or sellin' fake Guccis 
Whatever's in style and costs some big ? 
Just to get one, niggas get a real five 
It's all about the great paper chase 
A million dollars worth of whip appeal could even buy Babyface 
So read me all the rules so I can have my money right 
Cause I'm a new lady boss keepin' game tight 

So, you think you're all that, feelin' kinda phat 
But can you see where the wrong is?

But there's no doubt you're out to get yours anyway you can

They think they're all that 'cause they're popular in Europe

Please, I don't want to be like them bitches

Yo, y'all's hair is real fly, where'd ya all get your hair done at?

Salt-N-Pepa,"What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweatin' what I do
'Cause I'm gonna be just fine check it out

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

Now who do you think you are
Puttin' your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothin' to do
Than worry 'bout my friends? Check it

I can't do nothin', girl, without somebody buggin'
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinion's are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to

Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm steppin' closer
I'm not one for playing high-pole
Like the house of ditty-nine-oh-two-one-oh type of the ho
I treat a man like he treats me

The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothin' but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're poppin' all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit 'cause really it's none of your business

1993, S and P, packin' and mackin'
Bamboozlin' and smackin' suckers with this track
Throw the beat back in

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's ok 'cause I don't let it get it to me

Now every move I make somebody's clockin'
Don't ask me nothin', will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home, to bone

Ok, Miss Thing never givin' up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked

'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulivard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business

If I want to take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And she want to be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business

Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

So the moral of this story is, who are you to judge?
There's only one true judge, and that's God

So chill, and let my Father do His job

Now I've got this real phat attitude because of all the hype
Jealous-ass rappers broke as hell trying to play me on the mic
So test my respect, mess around, yeah, bitch
Jump up and get beat down
Now Salt shorty, light-skinned, sexy, and your man know
I got him screamin' like a hooker in the front row
So you better check my record, better yet, bum
My name is super for a record, check my platinum album

It's not meant for you to do
You even sound wack when you try to check the mic
One, two, one, two
But wait I'm not through, how you livin' sayin' old rhymes
Tryin' to get new?
You don't work like the two to make hip-hop

You hear talk about Pep around the way gettin' skeezed
Yo, me and my man was with Pepa last night, yo

You couldn't hump me if my first name was Cooty Cat
Your little Jimmy can't even hold your zipper back
Why don't you tell the story right, man?
The only skins you ever hit was the skins on your right hand
You rolled up on me in your man's Beemer
And I could look at you and tell you was a meat-beatin' daydreamer

You put the window down tryin' to act real slick
And started smilin' like a hooker with a bag of tricks
You stuck your hand out the window trying to show me gold
Your forty-second street Rolex was kinda old
I wrote a number, and I know you thought you'd get humped
But it was Dial-A-Date 1-900-Chump
So why you runnin' around town playin' Jeopardy?

How people never miss a possip, they just believe the gossip
Instead of finding out the truth of what's up
It's got my nostrils flairin'
I'd be a fool if I believe half of the dumb shit I be hearing
'Cuz ev'rytime I meet a guy that's got it goin' on
One of my jealous girlfriends gotta find something that's wrong

If he's not drivin' a Benz or Beemer then he's bummy
Or he's sellin' Buddah if he's got plenty of money
Now ask me why, I don't know why or well or what the hell

Somebody's ringin' my bell [Come on  baby] 

It's your man driving to my house every day 
Trying to get a play but I say no way 
Keep him on a leash 'cause he's a D O G 

Hot diggity dog comin' for my coochie 
Boom bam-boom, knock-knock-knock 

Waking up my Moms, waking up my Pops, somebody call the cops 
And get this fool off my stoop, see 



Can you believe that your man is a groupie? 



Not-not dedicated, ought to get him spaded 



Cut the nuts and get his shots upgraded 



So what ya feed him at home? It must be bones 



Give him some meat so he can leave me alone

Now here's a description of the (nigga) that I'm dissin' 



If your man fits this category then dismiss him 



You gotta dig him, get rid of him, have no pity for him 



Send him on his way, yeah, girl, and forget about him 



He's got a problem, and it's similar to drugs 



Not weed, cocaine, crack or dud, it's an erection, huh 



He's a mission, a sexual transition 



Addiction, affliction, so girls, sign the petition 



He's a man that likes easy pickin' 



Thinking that every girl is like easy stickin' 



You gotta realize that girls are not store-bought 



Like Newports, a pack of cigarettes smoked to the butt 



So now I know that what I know I know is now true 



You're being true to lovin' a brother that's not with you 



You want to bootie smack from the back

Sometimes you will, sometimes you won't 



Now you see 'em, yo, now you don't

He's a somma time man, a summer somma time 



Especially when it's hot sex is always on his mind 



Lookin', dippin' and dog your short skirts, no stockings 



No matter who it is, long as he's boot-knockin' 



???

La-di-da-di all the way to ? 



Runnin' through girls like it's musical punanee 



So come one, come all, he try to right you all 



With that greater than Tibet-time free-fall 



Talking that same old same lame ??? 



Diggity-yack cat brother talking that bullcrap 



But everytime he parts his lips

That the minute you started showing me neglect 

Is the same minute I started feeling the effect 

Why I held it in I didn't want to accept 

That it could be over just for cheap sex

Temporary lover, never let you go
I spend my money on you
Boy toy, I love you so
Never no stress, let's keep this flow
I know you feel the same way, too

Where you been all my life
No diamonds on her fingers
But I know you got a wifey, boo, word to life
No proof, 'cause Pepa got plans for you
Reservations for two on a flight to Honolulu
No disrespect, for losin' sweats
You take the keys to my Lex, and this here blank check
So shop till you drop, thanks to hip-hop you tight
Have you fly, F.B.I. want to indict
Bet you shit is right, got my daisies
Goin' crazy, the 20 ways you laid me, uh
Now come and bathe me, want to get high
Take this helicopter ride
From the westside down to the eastside
Pick a highrise, I'll buy, uh, you know why
'cause you're all that, no commitments, no lies
Never settle for less, I'm the best, no stress

I'm never vexed givin' up no sex
Unless I want to release stress
And get this shit up off my chest
Enjoy how you massage my mind, at times
Feedin' me some knowledge instead of tryin' to out rhyme
Not insecure, for sure, not bored
Send you a first class ticket when I'm out on tour
Show me a lot of love in the club
You know your place, you give me my space, stay out my face
A G worth a cristal, for you and your pals
I love to see the other women yearn waitin' on their turn
Money earnin', more money, cash, checks
But you ain't never met a girl like this yet

What's up, man
You got that package I sent you
Yeah I got it
Did you like it

My pockets goes high, so we can ride
I'll pick you up about nine-ish
Take you to the finest, masseuse
And we can get loose, sleigh la bouche styles
Get wild, I'll bet I leave your ass with a smile
Always a mouse, Spinderella, trick cheddar
I like a good fella but I love a boy toy better

Cheryl James, you know my name, I love the same
I check for a player with a lot of game
Not a little, not tryin' to get caught in the middle
Uh, I like my toy part like a Tonka truck
Hit the middle, uh, like Larry Zonka, what

I thought I couldn't handle it, uh, I had enough
But all praises due to the Most High

Check you, Mr. Slick, who you tryin' to trick
See a sign sayin' pick, want to play me for a quick stick
With the next chick telling me you working late
When my girls already saw you on a date
Whoopty-whoop, black, the hell with that, can't get me back
Bread's on the menu, pictures of the chick you had
Now you want to flex to impress with the Lexus
Diamonds and negators, uh, I'll check you later
There's more comin' attractions in the movie theater
I turn you down with the fader, don't be a player-hater
'cause you know what I'm workin' with son
The same damn thing that had you shook, trickin' from day one
Feelin' the pimp now, pockets lookin' slim now
I'm want mad shit, it's sh-sh-shoopin' like, hmmm, with him now
No doubt, yeah, 'cause I love the way he work it out
And he showed me things you don't even know about

[Chorus: x2]

Always and forever, I remember when you sang it to me
I feel you sleezin' me, sleepin' with the enemy
The lifestyle you was livin' was a mystery
Don't say shit to me, 'cause now you history
Don't ask where you are, I want to know how far
I hear you trickin' on hookers at the bar
You're makin' moves on the girl
Ain't got a care in the world
That's why I made you double up every time I twirled
But the sex is not the best, don't expect me to take less
So rest, and the next man come and bless
The daisy, boy you crazy, don't play me
Get over yourself baby, 'cause you don't even faze me
I'm known as Salt in the game with aim and no shame
And I still have my fame to claim, ain't nothin' changed
But the weather, and how to make the cheddar better
And I'll never take you back, that's always and forever

And those roses on the bed
And you grabbed me and said
Ooh, you got it, hmmm, you got it
Remember I held you real tight
And I rocked it all night
I said, hmmm, I got it, hmmm, I got it

(So) Let me in, (Let) let me in (My baby)
Let me in, let me in (Ooh)
Let me in, let me in (I'm on my hands and knees, girl)
Let me in, somethin' 'bout the way I feel

Oh my, how the table's turned, play with fire you get burned
What goes around comes around, now your ass is hurt
Reminiscin' how the Pepa was a real lover
The type of girl that made you uh-uh-uh, over and over
You talkin' like you want me back, but never brother
You blew it, when I pulled your cover, however
No need for me to stress the mess
The mess caused in our love nest, nevertheless, yes

Moving on, looking good, and I'm well-dressed
The blessed achieve high self-esteem, fulfill my dream
That's why I always get the cream 'cause I got my child
Who makes me smile, no time for the man who keeps it wild (That's right)
I'm keepin' you on foul, you exiled, that's how it gotta be
So cease 'cause you ain't pleasin' me

La belleza de esta melodía eres tú
Ya no yo más solo tú
Es lo que quiero en mí ser

Con manos vacías me encuentro
A tu puerta estoy, nunca creí necesitar
Como te necesito Dios

Esta copa que vacía esta
Llénala y rebózala
Y al mundo que perdido esta
Muestra la gloria de tu amor

Así que cada respiración
La respirare por ti
Mi vida es tuya, tómala
Necesito tu verdad

De mi historia eres el autor
Ven toma el control
Escribe en mi alma tu voluntad
Y en mi corazón

",Te Enaltezco Dios
Salvador,"You can't walk into a room
Without feeling obligated
To be the life of the party again

You can't stand to look around
And see anybody with a frown
So you turn on the same old song and dance

Even if you're at the end of your road
You can't let anybody know
'Cause you're too busy
Being everybody's everything

So have fun trying to be the sun
Chasing everybody's blues away
Good luck trying to keep it up

It would never be enough
And your days are never done
When you're trying to be the sun

I know that you're meaning well
But it's not hard for me to tell
That you don't have the same joy inside

I know without a doubt
That you're close to burning out
But you can't even let yourself give in

Yeah, I know that you're at the end of your road
But you can't let anybody know
'Cause you're too busy
Being everybody's everything

You'll never see who you are
When you're trying to be who you're not

",Trying to Be the Sun
Salvador,"So many times I stayed thirsty
When all along I had Your cup
Within my reach

So many times I've gone weary
When there's a water edge
Where I could rest

Renew me, refine me
Refresh me
Bring me to life

Overcome me like a waterfall
Overwhelm me, let me see You as You are
Pursue me, all of the days of my life
Let Your water fall

So many times I've run on empty
When all along I had Your word lifting me up
And when my life is like a desert
You're like a precious spring that rises up within

Renew me, refine me
Refresh me
Bring me to life

",Waterfall
Salvador,"It might be hard to understand
How I feel, how I feel
I'll use my voice, I'll use my hands
To reveal, to reveal

A melody that we can bring in harmony
Together let the nations stand in unity
And in love we will sing

You are so wonderful
You are so lovely
Your love is endless
How can I describe how I feel inside?

You are so faithful
Day after day it's so incredible
How Your love for me never fades away
You are so wonderful

You set my broken spirit free
With Your love, with Your love
Let's come together now and sing
Of what You've done, what You've done

A melody that we can bring in harmony
Together let the nations stand in unity
And in love we will sing

You are so wonderful
You are so lovely
Your love is endless
How can I describe how I feel inside?

You are so faithful
Day after day it's so incredible
How Your love for me never fades away
You are so wonderful

A melody that we can bring in harmony
Together let the nations stand in unity
And in love we will sing

You are so wonderful
You are so lovely
Your love is endless
How can I describe how I feel inside?

You are so faithful
Day after day it's so incredible
How Your love for me never fades away
You are so wonderful

",You Are So Wonderful
Salvador,"There's poison in the boys in blue,
There's poison in the boys in blue...
Corruption, greed and feud are all I see!

You're in a disarray,
Things used to be a different way,
Whatever happened to the golden age?

It's gone, yeah, it's gone away...
So don't ever turn your back again...
(One false move and we're all dead.)

Here I am,
Here I am,
Here I am.
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand,
On top of the mountain again!

There's movement in the distance,
Gunshots are what I hear,
This petty resistance is all I see!

I want to walk away...
Remember better days...
We watch the death of something beautiful!

It's gone, yeah, it's gone away...
So don't ever turn your back again...
(One false move and we're all dead.)

Here I am,
Here I am,
Here I am.
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand,
On top of the mountain again!

When we find a problem,
We never look back and say,
""One chance, one moment,
It's gone so easily!""

Well, here I am,
Here I am,
Here I am...
I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand,

I'm back at the crossroads again...
Oh, let me stand, let me stand, let me stand,
On top of the mountain again!",Here I Am
Salvator Tassone,"Why should I feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows come?
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heaven and home?

When Jesus is my captain
My constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
Oh, His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
He watches me

",His Eye Is on the Sparrow
Salvator Tassone,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song!!",Without a Song

Salvatore Andolina,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

Salvatore Bonafede,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Salvatore Bonafede,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Salvo Castagna,"Ogni giorno ha un perché
Tra un debutto e un addio
E una strada che non farai mai
Ma correndo però i dettagli si perdono
E non sempre vedi dove vai
Ogni tanto rallentare fa sentire liberi
Certe nuvole fan bene per i cieli limpidi

Tu mi fai bene

E smuovi questo mio presente immobile
Tu che sai amare incondizionatamente
Mi prendi ed io so chi sei
Ma l’ho sempre saputo sai

Ogni vita ha un perché
Ma non sempre lo sai
Se rincorri quel che fugge via
Ci ho creduto anch’io
A una vita ad ostacoli
Poi ho capito che non era mia
I traguardi sono il fine
Ma è importante perdersi

Tu mi fai bene
Vivimi semplicemente
All’improvviso mi sfiori
Rischiari questo mio presente variabile
Tu che sai amare incondizionatamente
Mi accendi ed io so chi sei
Ma l’ho sempre saputo sai

C’eri già nei giorni miei
Dentro i miei silenzi
Eri persistente
Nella mente forse anch’io per te

Tu mi fai bene
Vivimi semplicemente
Con gli occhi al cielo
E le mani che cercano le mie per sempre
È possibile

Sam,"I promise I'd never deny myself the chance
To feel the warmth of love
And its sweet romance
And I promised I would never find myself the way
Hurt by love
So tell me what this is all about?
Your sudden change and sudden doubt
Bay I gave you everything I had
Everything you asked of me and more, and more
And there are sometimes, maybe often times I sit here all alone
Wishing you were home with me
And there's sometimes, often in my mind
I wish you'd stay away
Cause I can't take the pain you bring me sometimes
You told me that you'd never loved this way before
And that nobody every gave you what you were looking for
And you told me that no one would ever take my place
Beside you, here beside you
So tell me what this love's all about
Cause your changing ways I could do without
I should have known
That this just wouldn't be forever
I feel sometimes I just don't give a damn about it
And I feel that I just can't go on",Sometimes

Sam Brown,"I saw a bit of silver shining in a puddle
I was gonna pick it up

So quick to jump in
I saw the look in your eyes 
Searching for something

You want a piece of my luck
Go ahead and take it

You want a piece of my cake
When I haven't even baked it
You want a piece of my head

Whereas her soul out on bail it moans as she takes her final breath

\""A Bit of a Good Time,\"" effervescing ever after:
\""Toiled and toiled until sunk into sublime.\""

Out on the mountain, down in the town there is a bright and shining air
Circling cars with their windows in love, steaming up like a heady affair
In through the door, behind the curtain
This is the moon shining
Down through the sewer and onto the floor
Where the happy and free are whining and dining
Whining and dining.

Sometimes there are bridges falling down
Sometimes they drown in the winter seas
Sometimes the earth is really flat

Sometimes it gets hot in here
Sometimes the heat is unbearable
Sometimes it's bloody freezing
I could die from the cold I swear.

And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Stop if love me

Now's the time to be sorry

Sam Bush,"Spider John is my name, friends
I'm in between freights, and I sure would be obliged
If I could share your company.
I'm on my way to nowhere; I been runnin' from my past,
Runnin' from the things I used to be.


Now I know my words sound strange to you
But if you'll wait till my song is sung and my story's told
You might come to understand
Why I'm old and bent and devil spent, and a-runnin' out of time
When not long ago I held a royal flush in my hand.

Chorus:
Oh, I was a supermarket fool; I was a motorbank stool pigeon,
Robbin' my own time.
I thought I'd lost my blues, yes, I thought I'd paid my dues
And I thought I'd found a life to suit my style.
And I was Spider John, the robberman
Long, tall, and handsome,
Yes, I was Spider John with a loaded hand
Takin' ransom.

And then one day I met Diamond Lil
And she was as sweet a thing, I declare, as the summer wind
Had ever blown my way.
Lil she had no idea of my illustrious occupation, 
She thought I was a saint and not a sinner gone astray

Spider he loved his Lily so much
He could not confess his sins, for he knew if he did
The lady would surely take her leave.
But you know that the word got around, and Lily left town
And he never saw her again,
Tossin' and turnin' and causin' his heart to grieve.

Chorus

And that is all my story.
It's been these thirty years since I took the road
To find my precious jewel one.
Now if you see my Lily, won't you give her my regards,
Tell her old Spider got tangled in the black web that he spun
You can tell her that Spider got tangled in the black web that he spun.

Sam Bush,"I wish that I cold be an Indian
On a painted pony so fast
No one could ever catch me
I get caught up in my past
I'd ride across many rivers
Too many moons to tell the times
Then Id tell all the young Warriors
Many moons ago this was mine, all mine!

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea!
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun!
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a Pirate
I'd sail the ocean blue
Way before the big liners
Started sailing them too
I'd bury most of my treasures
So I would leave a big hole
And the only real sense of pleasure (That I'd get)
Is to sail free of my soul

Same ol' river
Same ol' sea!
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun!
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be a Slave
It doesn't matter what kind
I'd sing a song for fallen angels
Try and be free in my mind
Then when no one wasn't looking
I'd drop my heartless plow
I'd find my own contemporary's
And Id wipe the shame from their brow!!!!

Same ol' sea!
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon
Same ol' sun!
Same ol' race that we've always run
Same ol' race that we've always run

I wish that I could be an outlaw
Runnin' from the law sometimes
No vigilantly against the seasons
But I cant help but read why
I'd always keep my revolver
Steady and fast at my side and
I'd rob a train bound for glory
'Cause I thought I needed a ride

Same ol' sea!
Same ol' water rushing over me
Same ol' moon

Tender thoughts occur to me

In the nighttime when I dream

When I pass a garden fair
And the scent is in the air
In my mind a dream awakes
And my heart begins to break

But you said goodbye to me
Now all I can do is grieve
Can it be that you forgot?
Darling forget me not!

And leave this heart that's broken

So I can mend",Come Back to Sorrento

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this

Sit down","Good Morning, Heartache"
Sam Cooke,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",Moulin Rouge
Sam Cooke,"Hey, Venus, oh, Venus
Venus, if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you

Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Venus, goddess of love that you are

Make my wish come true",Venus
Sam Cooke,"Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wonder
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind.

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
Made me a slave to my wandering ways.

Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wonder
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind.

Oh, I met a girl in a border town
I vowed we'd never part
Though I tried my best to settle down
I'm now alone with a broken heart.

Oh, the wayward wind is a restless wind
A restless wind that yearns to wonder
And I was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind.

Sam Cooke,"I've got a girl and, man, she's, oh, so fine
Someday I'd like to make her mine, oh, mine
She's fine but she won't give me a chance
When I want to sweet talk
All she wants to do is dance

Let me tell you
She likes the movin' and a groovin'
Man, she likes the movin' and a groovin'
Rock in the night out and the day in

She likes the swishin' and the swayin'
Oh, she like the movin' and a grovin'
Watch her move, move, move, move

Ask her to a movie, just the other day
Try to make her relax, in a different way
It didn't pay, I didn't even stand a chance
She said, you go to movie
I think that I'd rather dance

She made it plain to me
She likes the movin' and a groovin'
She likes the movin and a groovin
Rock in the night out and the day in

She likes the swishin' and the swayin'
Man, she like the movin' and a groovin'
Watch her move, move, move, move

I've got the situation well in hand
I found out that if I'm going to be man
I've gotta be a man

If I'm gonna stand a chance
If I'm gonna make her my woman
I've just got to learn and dance

Now you wanna see me
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'

We're rockin' the night out and the day in
We're doing the swishin' and the swayin'
I'm doing the movin' and a grovin'
Watch me move, I'm movin', movin'

Sam Cooke,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

[Chorus]
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way

So, if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way",All the Way
Sam Cooke,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me
Nearly drove me out off my head
While you never shed a tear

Remember, I remember
All that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do

Sam Cooke,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings
Sam Cooke,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Sam Cooke,"I often think off the live I've led
And oh, it's a wonder, I ain't dead

Said my child, it's all catch up with you

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold

You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it

Sam Cooke,"Darling, I promise from this
Day forward, to go wherever you go
If you only tell me that you love me
That's all I need to know

You don't have to tell me 'bout your past life
About things you've done before
Oh my darling, just say you love me
That's all I need to know

I'll be your slave, your every crave
And wish is my command
But when I'm blue and lonely too
Be there to hold my hand

You don't have to tell me where
You came from, all I know is I love you
So, just say you love me
That's all I need to know

You don't have to tell me where

He met two strangers along the way
They were talking all about the Crucifixion
They stopped and here's what he said, he asked them

Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
(Were you there?)
Were you there when they crucified the Lord?
He asked them, were you there when the crucified the Lord?

And one of them told him
No, sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, tremble
He said I was there
I was there when they crucified the Lord

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
Tell me, did they really pierce Him in the side that morn
O Lord, he said if you were there
I wonder did they pierce the Savior in the side?

Sometimes it causes me to tremble
Every time I think about how they did the Lord
It makes me tremble 'cause I was there
And they really pierced him in the side that morning

A fellow said, I want you to tell me if you were there?
If you were there kindly tell me
Did he hang there and never say one word?

Sometimes I have to tremble
Every time I think about how they done the Lord
It makes me tremble

Sam Cooke,"Woah, Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave me water, Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water and it was not in the well

Well, there was a woman from Samaria, came to the well to get some water
There she met a stranger who did a story tell
Then the woman dropped her pitcher
She's drinking was made richer
From the water He gave her and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave her water, He gave that woman water
Gave her living, loving, lasting water and it was not in the well

Well, on that woman He had pity, she ran back to the city
Crying glory Hallelujah and did His wonders tell
She left my Savior singing, she came back to Him bringing
The times she'd had water Lord, and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave that woman water, gave her that love and lasting water
Water and it was not in the well

Well, Lord that woman left a shoutin' and there was no room for doubtin'
That she had met a Savior who did all wonders tell
Every time she doubtin' she start to think about Him
The man that gave her that water Lord, and it was not in the well

Yes, He gave her water, Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water, I wanna let His praises swell
Tell you He gave that woman water, gave her that love and lasting water

From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes

Oh, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen

A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man riding in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye

Oh, if he was your man, honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story

Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arms around her waist

Oh, he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was doing her wrong
And oh, let me tell you

Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hard wood floor

When a boy is in love
And the world to him is a beautiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boys in love
He can hardly wait til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing

And your path is free to walk

And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Then you became the bored one
I was like a toy
That brought you joy one day
A broken toy
That you preferred to throw away

If I expected love
When we first kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me

If you were on my mind
All night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on the stars
Don't blame it on your smile
Don't blame it on my eyes

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Moon shining on the parking lot dolls
Tanned legs in the night, sliding out of the sea, stilettos at the crosswalk
I graduated but every year in May I get that schools out feeling
I feel it creeping in every day and on weekends and I'm drowning in the freedom

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
Private school daughters that never go underwater keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gonna remember how much I loved her
I'm single for the suh uh uh single for the summer

I've gone off the deep end, company I'm keeping is messing me up
The good girls at home sleeping, while I'm out creeping 'til the sun comes up
Ooh I’ve got my phone faced down, and my hair combed back,
Riding round getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls holding hands and forgetting their names
I graduated but every year in May I get that school's out feeling
So I wanna leave and pretend that I'm not a cheater and I can't help leaving

Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh oh oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck

5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh oh oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

(Oh oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Hm yeah
(Oh oh oh oh oh) When the sun started sinking
(Oh oh oh oh oh) And they turned those open signs around
(Oh oh oh oh oh) We thought we ran this town, running around just
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Breaking hearts and curfews
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Out in the yard with no shoes
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Staying cool in neighbour the pool
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Fireball headed for the parking lot
(Oh oh oh oh oh) And no Saturday mornings when we sleep late
(Oh oh oh oh oh) ATV and firebreaks, worn out jeans, Black Eyed Peas, bathrobes
(Oh oh oh oh oh) And blue skies, I was born and raised on it
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Might have misbehaved on it

Sam Hunt,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Across some parking lot, hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd get red light beside me
In that white max with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
And we'd play the same poems
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she's find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets and so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should have known all along
You gotta move and move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
And now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets and so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should have known all along
You gotta move and move on
When you break up in a small town

Your little mailbox is sitting next to mine
And I drive into town sometimes and I see you there sitting there with him
And I wish about, I want to a fight, I want to say fuck that guy
But I can't, cause it's my fault, and I let her go
I never thought that

That she would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

Sam Hunt,"Well there ain't enough smoke in my eyes
To hide the kinda games you're trying to play
Honey don't you act so surprised
You know exactly what I'm bout to say
You kiss my lips, like you mean it
But you ain't that slick

Everywhere we go you keep looking around
Fixing your make up like its about to go down
And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see
Woahh woahhh woahh ohhh

That's why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house

You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town like they're in your living room

Sam Hunt,"Night sand felt good on sunburned feet
Sitting on pool chairs we drug to the beach, but that
Salty air was bittersweet
Waiting for the sun to rise
Best friends talking 'bout the memories we made
We couldn't believe that we were graduating
The wind and the waves were slipping away
But that moment felt so alive

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck
Splash in my cup, it'd never get old
One little sip, just a taste on my lip
I'd be taking a trip, wherever I go
I'd keep a life's good, sweet bliss
Does it ever really get better than this kinda buzz
If I could bottle it up
If I could bottle it up

Well the year me, and my grandad fixed that car
It was a summer full of grease and changing parts, but when we
Finally got that thing to start
Man, it sounded just right
Riding with the prettiest girl I know
Breaking in a brand new record on an old back road
When that first slow love song came on
She couldn't hide that little smile

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck
Splash in my cup, it'd never get old
One little sip, just a taste on my lip

I'd keep a life's good, sweet bliss
Does it ever really get better than this kinda buzz
If I could bottle it up
If I could bottle it up

And I'd drink it down
And I'd pass it around, pass it around
'Cause it'll sneak up on you fast
When life pours out the good stuff
Just can't make it last
That moment in time would never end
'Cause I'd take it with me when it did

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck

Sam Hunt,"Never seen such a beautiful straight face
I never questioned anything
You sealed my lips and you stole my shirt
Tattooed my heart but mark my words
What do you call the other half of half the truth?
What I didn’t know never hurt you
You should’ve paid up front when you sold me out
I lost so much sleep but it’s over now

Our love is lying there
Lying by your side
Murdered by the lies you told now you’re the one who cries
And your tears rain down
Rain down your face
And falling on the pillows in the bed you made

You left me nothing now it’s all I’ve got, for you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You kissed my mouth in brand-new places
Filled your camera with our faces
Wrote love letters underneath my name
Crawled in my arms everytime it rained
But all those memories, I’m burning ‘em baby
Can’t you see this ain’t no maybe?
You went and threw them all away somehow
What felt right then I can’t feel right now

Our love is lying there
Lying by your side
Murdered by the lies you told now you’re the one who cries
And your tears rain down
Rain down your face

Sam Hunt,"She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
And she don't step on sidewalk seams
Her teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
And she don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a tilt-a-whirl

I met a girl, she made me smile, she made me wait, she crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes, and baby blues, the way she moves
Is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunrise waits for her to wake up
She's a pony tail no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in the summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane, in blue jeans and pearls

I met a girl, she made me smile, she made me wait, she crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she lit me up

Sam Hunt,"Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Sam Hunt,"Oh, I drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Go for more and I don't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this

I'm sorry I named the album 'Montevallo'
And I'm sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I'm sorry you can't listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you've got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
To these songs you gave to me
'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMA's with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk
Barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

A year ago I was in a hotel room in Pheonix
Wonderin' if it's ever OK to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water, and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone
Singin' these songs are just something to do
Every dream I ever had was you
Hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind you can't fall out of

Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

I know this might seem like a contradiction
The last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do

Sam Levine,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Sam Noto,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

Just an invitation would have been just fine

What to do with this beating heart
While I bleed alone tonight

Pounding so, wanting more
Who can hear my beating heart
Pounding on the door

To make mistakes and be wiser
How long have I got
To learn to be less of a liar

All the money in the world all the power it can buy
Will not take your voice away
Can not own what you hold inside

Is it the same rain that falls on a poor man's room
Is it the same rain that falls on a rich man's tomb
Is it the same rain that falls on me

Is it the same rain that falls on the raging see
Is it the same rain that falls on the hanging tree
Is it the same rain that falls on me",Same Rain
Sam Phillips,"The trees are listening each time a missile's made

By diggers, drillers and sellers

My body was tempted to crumble into one
Reunion of dust until creation's done
Returning ashes to ashes
We won't stop 'till we're underneath a black sky

Self-slaughtered souls cry out to dead poor men
For a drink at the water hole

Forests raped into deserts

That true love runs looking for us
Like a lion in our dreams

The strawberry road
Where the dream fades
Is down between our longing and desire
The strawberry road
Where our hearts break into love

You censor longing and organize beauty
Because you're afraid
You want it more than oxygen or light

You can't get there with your morals
Or without love
Lie down with me
The rules aren't always right

Where the dream fades
Is down between our longing and desire

The things we've wanted
When we get them are never enough

You left your record out in the sun
All the signs of life aren't clear and straight and always right

The metal teeth of ugly rules

Between us there's no near or far

Where are you taking me
As you slide
Where are you taking me
Down inside

I've always wanted more
Like the whore who poured perfume on his feet

As I'm falling

I've got a long black cadillac
marble hot tub in the back
Champagne waterfall
solid gold question mark twenty feet tall

Over the holes as we're falling
The tightened grip is our mistake
As we're trying to hold on to the earth

wet on brave lips carved on road
Look for flame and mercy

Sam Phillips,"The violinist puts his violin away
Forbidden city broken into tonight
I use my blindfold to dry my tears
The stage is empty and tired of light

But when I do the fan dance
I'm all the red in China
I'm dialing life up on my telescope
Fringe and mathematics
Shaking down the curtain
To find the dragon parade

When I do the fan dance
Searchlights answer gunfire
Angels escort falling mercies
Hearts shut off like streetlights
But even in the blackout
I'll find my balcony rose

The violinist puts his violin away
Forbidden city broken into tonight
I use my blindfold to dry the tears
The stage is empty and tired of light

When I do the fan dance
I'm firecracker lightning
I burn with no trace up in the cold sky
I am broken open, waiting for inventions
Of light that see through to love

When I do the fan dance
I'm all the red in China
You write your questions on my skin
I'll be in your dark streets
To keep the lantern burning
Until your new world begins

Sam Phillips,"Incinerator, what have you done this time?
I heard the air raid siren go off
To settle attraction, you like to subdivide
Don't you want shelter from your desire? A place to hide

Incinerator, this is not about sex
It's about a personal scent
You like to watch me and I like to disappear
Electrical contact, a broken Tass of the Stratosphere

That I'm made of fire and you'll never get to me

Cold blues where love has never been

I hear the music up above my head

Tho the sound of hope has left me again

Dark and silky like a friend where love wore off
Looking for the land that's hidden in the cross
Find it's lost

I know, I love you too much

There's a river of grief that floods through our loves
It starts when a heart is broken into
By the thief of belief in anything that's true
But there's a river of love that runs through all time

There's a river of love that runs through all time
There's a river of tears that flows through our eyes
We fight through the night for freedom as it fades
Into a jail where we fail everytime we make a break
But there's a river of love that runs through all time

I had to run before I knew how to crawl
The first step was hard but I have had trouble with them all
But now the night grows darker and the day grows dim
'Cause I know I never will see you again
And I almost made you happy

There's a river of love that runs through all time
There's a river of fire that burns with no light
The flame is the pain of dreams gone up in smoke
From the lies we deny and breathe until we choke
There's a river of love that runs through all time",River of Love

He's taking back the city one sinner at a time

He remembers a time when everything was alright
We had water from wine, the streets were alive
Then old Captain Industry who sold his soul at Wounded Knee
Bought himself a little property
The Saint had found his enemy

He'll sacrifice if you pay the price

Lions for sheep - an eye for an eye

He wears a ring with the brand of a three-legged dog
His rose-coloured glasses cut through the fog

The laws might sleep but they never die
Lions for sheep, an eye for an eye

He came down on a storm cloud hard as the Amazon rain
Took him on, took him on and on
And you can pay your respects in the form of a cheque
He's taking back the city one sinner at a time

Sam Roberts,"Over land, I traveled time and space and quicksand
And for sixty days I knew no other road
And through the maelstrom, which turned in time with the kick drum
I was swallowed and twisted and spit out on a coast
And in this place there stands a gate that leads to the heart of the city
And I've spent seven years and a sea of fears in this broken mirror of a city
Listen to the streets there's a heartbeat missing in the city
Sweet sunlight, I can see it in my mind's eye
And I remember feeling alright
And I saw black clouds and Turin shrouds and it smelled of a faded empire
It's all concrete and steel, we're asleep at the wheel, and the mayor's just a gun for hire
Listen to the streets there's a heartbeat missing in the city
Listen to the sound there's a time bomb ticking in the city
I've heard the song the morning sings
Outside the gate is everything
Let in the light! Let in the light!
Streetwalker said to me she has no need for history
She has the key she has the key
Sweet sunlight, I can see it in my mind's eye
Let in the light! Let in the light!
Waking up from a dream where I was the stone and you were the stream
Chemical City isn't all that you need
But it's all that you're getting and they've hidden the key
Listen to the streets there's a heartbeat missing in the city
Listen to the sound there's a time bomb ticking in the city
I said this place is an unnatural disaster
And I'm a visitor here so I asked her:
Where are the trees, where are the trees?
And she said free yourself from history
That is the key! That is the key!
Sweet sunlight, I can see it in my mind's eye
I see the light! I see the light!

When it gets heavy now, will you let it fall?
And as the loon cries it opens minds
The stream reflects these Northern climes
Through these days we walk the line
Sixteen dollars and a couple of dimes

There've been a number of times
Took a step back, couldn't read the signs
Cross the plains till they start to climb
Down to the valley where the river winds
Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...

Grey skies, the waters rise
Mind flood's gonna break the bank
Will it wash us away now? Will it wash us away now?
Blue skies, the river dries
A light goes out before your eyes
Till the break of day now, till the break of day now

Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...
Goin' down to the river now, mind flood's got my head in the gutter
Will it wash us all away?
You come to with a shiver now,
Flash back eighth grade with a stutter
Will it wash us all away?

If love is a cult we are all believers
Cruel, passionate underachievers
Fools lashing out at the dreamers
Kiss the enemy and kill the redeemer
We are indeed a dying breed
We are the people of the sky
So when the river floods and you're made from mud
Get yourself up high....

Sing it for me, sing it for me
When the water comes down, get yourself up high...

Sam Roberts,"Ooh, it's got me mystified, heavy now
Deep down to my soul
You try to keep the wheel steady now
Easy as she goes
I can hear on the wind a tale that needs to be told again
The horizon bends at either end and the sea can't tell a foe from a friend

I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

I was never satisfied with any life 'til she called my name
The air on the high ground was rarefied, every day the same
And old fears were always near but when we set sail they disappeared
There are those who fear the deep but the world don't wait when your faith won't leap

And I know it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

Then we watched as the Southern Cross led the sailors home, constellation borne
We set sail in a heavy gale and to the sea many of us thrown
And there were times when my courage failed but I never bowed to the storm
Whatever path you choose to walk, in the end, you walk alone

Ooh, it's got me mystified heavy now
Tongue-tied to the anchor chain
You try to keep your hand steady now
But it slips again
And landfall surprised us all and she broke on the rocks like a china doll
You can hear the siren call for the last dance at Poseidon's Ball

I know it was only a dream
As delicate a dragonfly wing
I hope it was only a dream
As delicate as a dragonfly wing

We are the soldiers of the Cause
We shouted out the same decree
To hold the truth above the law

Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced 
While the city slept

I was born a restless soul
I never did what I was told
That old fire rages on
I hope it burns after I'm gone

I'm getting tired of the same old thing
It only takes one soul to make a change
It takes two young hearts to make it beat again
Three long nights and you're on the mend
Living, loving, swinging, ducking
We might fail but we have to try
I poked my finger in the public eye

Those were the nights to remember 
Now they're the nights to forget
We sang from May to September and we danced 
While the city slept

We are the only chance
This is our resistance
And if we fail then we all know
How it goes, it goes
How it goes, it goes

I navigate the mines we lay
And I'm comin' home but not today
I fought my way through the hungry mob
The Mayor and his henchmen on the job
We faced-off like it was High Noon,
We both let fly and our aim was true

Sam Roberts,"The cinematic after effects of alcohol
Have led me to believe
That there's nothing more beautiful
Than a face as it starts to fade
From your memory, what had once been clear as the day
Obscured by the shade

And I was always the thorn to your rose

A long string of disappointing days
Led me to concede that I'd been losing sleep
And I'm tired and frayed at the seams
And things are changing in me
It's been two hard months since I could call you my own
It cuts to the bone
Is there anything that I can do when I've been turned into stone

But I was always the thorn to your rose
Some doors are better left closed

You move like a rolling wave
One that don't fade when it's gone
Beyond a doubt it gets so hard that a stone would cry out

I know there's a lesson in here
But it's so hard to find
I've been searching my mind
A little pearl of wisdom for the later years
When the thread of this life starts to unwind
I never had to fight for my love
But that's over I know
It's just how it goes
I never had to fight for my love
But that's over I know

Feeling strange and disheveled
Past the abattoir and the glory holes
Like a film noire in the starring role

To the side streets, kept my nose clean
Tasted beautiful, tasted obscene
Singing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

A commotion on the assembly line
Raise a glass to the ambassador
As she's moving you to the dance floor

Remember those times?
Can anyone here tonight
Just tell me what they felt like?

So many years, so many lives
These are the streets where they collide
From Jimmy Hoffa to Cadillac
Some look ahead, I'm going back
'Cause I'm just looking for some sounds
To ease the vice that squeezes us every day

This was Motown, this was New France
Where the Chippewa did the fire dance
That was long ago, this is here and now

To the lions of the Kalahari?
I don't care if they eat my bones

Rubber on dust as the wheels go round
I had never heard a sweeter sound
Till the day that I heard my baby cry
These things I shall carry until I die

Oh, she's never far away from me
Oh, she's never far away from me

The rains came heavy and we closed our eyes
And listened to the song pourin? from the skies
Two miles from the border as the eagle flies
But the desert is the same on the other side

The leaves on Mt. Royal turn from green to gold
And crimson as the autumn light takes hold
October's here, I'm another year old

Sam Roberts,"This is love at the end of the world
You don't need diamonds and you don't need pearls
Water boils on the seven seas
Rivers of blood and she's setting me free
And you're still near me, baby

Smoke rising from an open field
Don't you know that the threat is real
From the top of Mount Kilimanjaro?
You look around but you don't see snow
The heat is rising, baby

This is love at the end of the world
There's still love at the end of the world

Two wars and a revolution
Got me praying for absolution
There's blood on these hands, baby
Preacher saying that the end is nigh
Standing on a soapbox a hundred feet high
You're still by my side, baby

Light fades, becomes shade
You're holding on but you're slipping away
Till I can't feel you anymore

This is love at the end of the world
There's still love at the end of the world

Red lips, alabaster hands
Ooh girl, what you do to a man
The heat is rising, baby
You don't think, you just follow the herd
And you don't need bullets for a war of words now
They want what we've got, baby

Light fades, becomes shade
You're holding on but you're slipping away

I could never satisfy you at all
Always thought you had gentle eyes
Then you've had me institutionalized

Now look at me, I'm just younger than old
The years don't seem to touch you
It makes me wonder what you sold

Oh, my Maria
I'll never change you, I know, I know
I need to see you
That never changes, oh no

You lived on the 7th floor
It was far from heaven but it meant more
You said things that were hard to ignore
My conversation makes you bored

You always hated wedding bells
You'd go out riding with the Hell's and say
Life is for the taking
Life is for the taking

Oh, my Maria
I'll never change you, I know, I know
I need to see you
That never changes, oh no

So how's it gonna be, Maria?
Will it be you and me?
Or will it be
Five more years of counting my tears
Five more years of living in fear

I beg for my supper at night
If this is love then it don't feel right
And my heart's burning out of control
They gave her five but she's out on parole

Hey, hey, hey
This girl is leading me astray

Saw a photograph of you today
Your eyes look tired but you haven't aged
And now I see that you made the front page
Married for the money and you blew him away

Oh Maria, when you were doing time
You only had five words on your mind
Life is for the taking
Life is for the taking

Oh, my Maria
I'll never change you, I know, I know

Is this wanderlust 
Or running from myself? 
My neck was in the noose, but now I've been cut loose 
And put out to graze in delicate pastures 
Now I'm waiting for someone to put me to use 

I hope it's clear as crystal 
That the man with the pistol 
Is calling all the shots these days

You can escape from your chains

And I have no one to thank for any happiness that I've found
And guns blaze, they burn as bright as the sun

The children of a dying breed

But the beaten path leaves little choice
The melody that you thought you found
Reveals that she's been sleeping around

We were apostles, they were the high priests
We lived the hustle, the keepers of the back beat
We're under pressure to reconcile
Our point of view with contemporary style

It used to be that the kids were the ones
Who knew how to get off
It was a yell from the swamp
Now it's only coming out as a cough

I can't sell my songs so I'm
Gonna have to give them away
I can't sell myself since my hair
Started turning to gray

And drawn to fame like a moth to a flame
Living hand to mouth but I'm hoping for change

I've been staring at a square face in the mirror for years
She feels like water and she tastes like wind
And her fire burns hotter when the night rolls in

You've been a saint, I've been a sinner
You're a fat cat, I'm getting thinner
I'm having trouble telling wrong from right
These slippery handshakes that keep me awake at night

Oh, I think you've seen me before
You had your eyes on mine 'cause your grass don't grow
This ain't a song, it's a call to arms
There's a gathering storm, better sound the alarm

I've been waking the dead
I've been leaning on tradition
Trying to make amends with the dead
Prayer candles that I burn at both ends

Missed opportunities we won't share again
I recognized in the touch of a friend
That I am closer to the place I began
And so far from where I want it to end

You only miss it when it's long gone
You only hear it when it's our song
Keep looking up 'cause it's a long way down
Keep looking up 'cause it's a long way down

And now I'm walking with the dead
An apparition trying to get ahead
Bleed some pressure from this hole in my heavy head
And there was high water everywhere
Back teeth are swimming and I wished I cared
My teeth are swimming and I wish that I cared

You only miss it when it's long gone
You only hear it when it's our song
Keep looking up 'cause it's a long way down

To carry on, to carry on

Well, I'm never quite closed
But I ain't open to change

From knocking on wood

Perhaps more than I should

It can break and fall apart
It can bleed and stop and start

And you can take all the other women
And you can have it all, just give me my baby, give my my baby

Oh...
Yeah...
Ooh..., Oh...
Baby... 
  
(Verse 1) 
It came unexpected
The birth of your child
Now you've been forced
To provide a way
For you and your baby
You go to work from 9 to 5
You're up at night when the baby cries
Girl, I don't care
Why he left you 
All I know is I love you and your child 
  
(Chorus) 
I love you both
I'll turn this house into a home
I love you both
You're not in this alone
I love you both
Let me be the man he couldn't be
I love you both
Girl, you need to get with me 
  
(Chorus) 
  
(Verse 2) 
The baby has your eyes
Yeah, the baby has your smile
So how can I not love you both
I need you in my life
I'll never walk away from you
I'm here to help you
See this through
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
Girl, take it all
'Cause I love you and your child 
  
(Chorus) x 2 
  
(Bridge) 
I want you to know ",I Love You Both
Sam Salter,"Every song on the radio
Seems like it's talking about me
A message from another voice
Telling me I made the wrong choice, oh no
I close my eyes and shed a tear
The music makes me with you were here
Girl, since I let my baby go
I know I made a mistake

'Cause it took a song
To make me understand
It took a song
To make me be a man
It took a song
To make me understand
It took a song
To make me miss you

The silence of a melody
It game me time to see
See just how wrong I've been
Please come back
Before this song ends
Now I am the lonely one
And you are the reason
Girl I know I was wrong
And I heard it in a song

Is all over again
Will I ever hear (will I ever hear)
Your melody (your melody)
And your song again
It's been so long (so long)
Baby come back home (baby come back home)

Soft wind is blowing through the trees

Hey little beaver block up that stream
Look at the robin feeding her young'uns
And the old black bear reaching into a hive

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you

The moon, and the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I’m missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling’s overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you’re alright

I had a dream in a panic you came running out

For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you're never strong

Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

We'd talk maybe 20 times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

You refuse to see this, don't see it anymore

Don't you see what I can bring
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free

Sam Smith,"My mind runs away to you
With the thought I hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there we're meant to be
So keep your head up and make it to me
And make it to me

So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to say
So much to get off my chest

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

It was a Friday night, I knew that I would be okay
Don't say it was a good thing
Don't say it was the right thing to do
Don't say it was the best thing for the both of us
When I'm the one playing the fool

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I'm the one to leave it apart
So let me restart

You've been lightin' up my phone
Worried that I'll be alone tonight
Wanna make sure that I'm fine
But baby you're not on my mind, no more
I know it was the best thing for the both of us
Cause you're the one who looks like a fool

What do you want from me when I just wanna restart
You keep coming back for me when you're the one who tore us apart
And the truth is I'm better on my own
And I'm the one to leave it apart

Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

I fall in love whenever we meet

Well I'm sure you have,
You're very sexy.
Haha, sticky-icky-licky-icky-licky-icky-licky.


You seem need a lot of me
But baby, no, it just can't be.
Oh no.
Honey, you're just to clingy, hey,
And now you need to set me free
C'mon and set me free
You see I went outside just to take a stroll
And when I came back I had ten missed calls
From you, ooooh
Like when you're walking down the street doing what you do
And you step into some gum that's stuck to your shoe,
That reminds me of you

You must've thought I was your snack,
Because you're sticking to me like cling wrap, scooby doo be doo be doo doo. (2x)

You must've thought you were my wife
Because you're trying to run my life
Uou're causing me a lot of strife
I'm gonna cut you up now let me get my knife
I said where's my knife? Where's my knife?
You see I've got enough friends that could fill a truck up
Now give me some room and just back the fuck up
Like when you're washing you're clothes at the laundromatic
And you pull them out the dryer and they stick like static
That's what you do

You must've thought I was your snack
Because you're sticking to me like cling wrap (2x)

You better pull aside, hahahahaha.
I'm gonna need me a pair of pliers
To get you off my back because you've crossed your wires
I need you like I need fifteen spare tires
If I was Donald Trump then I'd say you're fired
It's the cling wrap

Yo, it's the cling wrap.
Now see, when people be dropping hints,
You better take 'em
It won't matter, before you let yourself go
And act all crazy
You must have though I was your snack
'Cause now you'll stick to me like cling wrap.
Oh, 'cause you love me.
When did you get so crazy?
Ohhhhh
When did you get so crazy?
When did you get so crazy?!

You're sticky, you're sticky, you're sticky

Sam Sparro,"It was just an ordinary afternoon I was sitting in the park
Trying to forget all of my blues, I wanted a lil' something to spark
And so in God's green earth I did partake an unusual affair
I forgot my woes while I fell awake, I didn't have a single care

Then I noticed something very wrong
I was so parched I could not sing this song

Hey, cottonmouth, cottonmouth, you're so damn rough
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, woah
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, don't know what to do
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, so in love with you

In what was just an ordinary afternoon became complicated
In my intent to drive away my blues I got discombobulated
I tried to get my cloudy head to think, see I needed a solution
But the only water I could find to drink was full of pollution

Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, you're so damn rough
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, woah
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, don't know what to do
Cottonmouth, cottonmouth, so in love with you

I only know one thing that makes it better
So call you girl and boys and get 'em out to (call your girls and call your boys up)

Sam Sparro,"If you stand tall with your back to the door
Then it's your own fault when you get knocked to the floor
You may have fooled me once
But I've got a pretty damn good memory

It's a small world what a type cliche
But it's a small world, how many times can I say
That everything you do will end up
Coming right back around again

And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you, I'm sorry for you
Yeah, the people that you keep around
Well, you learn from them and they learn from you

So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket
Yeah, keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket

Well, you just might start to melt them down
And they'll come around
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket

It's a long haul to the front of the line
And you get the in your own sweet time
But there's always somebody
Who decides to cut right in front of you

A wide eye looking for a ticket to ride
It's a long night I hope you make it out alive
You can't spend your whole life
Worrying about what's behind you

And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you, I'm sorry for you

Well, you just might start to melt them down
And they'll come around
So keep your friends close
And your enemies in your pocket

And it's a lively color not black and white
But some people think they're the ones who got it right
In a room so full
Well, you have to be a little more flexible

And if you don't know that by now
Then I feel quite sorry for you, I'm sorry for you

Well, you'll learn from them and they learn from you

Samael,"Let it rain a day, a week, a year
Let it rain a thousand years a day
That's the divine answer to all the shed tears
That's the cyclic flood well known by those who know
One drop for every broken dream
And one for every conceived plan

Our seeds sown larger
Our roots will go deeper
Our trees will grow higher and now we wait the rain

Let cry the skies to cleanse the souls
Let fall the seas to wash the pain away
That's the final run to the new age
That's the first step beyond the threshold of this world
One drop for every broken dream
And one for every conceived plan

Our seeds sown larger
Our roots will go deeper
Our trees will grow higher and now we wait the rain

Here rings a warning
A day of wrath
For all the days of war
A storm of fury
To calm the hunger left

Our seeds sown larger
Our roots will go deeper
Our trees will grow higher and now we wait the rain
Our seeds larger
Our roots deeper
Our trees higher and we stronger",Rain

You turned your love light on, so I could see.
When I lost faith in myself and humanity,
You were the one who gave it back to me.
Now there's pain in your eyes,
As you try to fight back all the tears.

[Chorus]
Maybe you can't see, I'm right here.
Don't be ashamed if you want somebody near.
Look over your shoulder, the way is clear.
All you gotta do is say my name, I'm right here.

You don't always have to be under control;
Sometimes you have to lose it to find your soul.
You hate yourself for the weakness you feel inside,
And your reaction is to run and hide.
Well I know how it feels to be facing everything you fear.

Baby, I wasn't sure if it ever would be.
But deep down inside the love was so right;
Never thought I could feel this way.

Baby, all of those nights
I was holding you tight.
Didn't realize our love would just fade away,
So tell me what am I gonna do?

When the shadow of love
Lives deep down in me,
It's all that I feel,
And all I can see.
And since you said goodbye,
It's not been the same.
And all that's left is the shadow of your life.

Do you remember the times you said to me,
There was nobody else you would ever need?
Now all of those times are just memories,
Of a love that we thought would last.

And through all of the fears,
I cried all of those tears.
What was it that just made our love fade away?

But I know in my heart you'll always be here,
Because you're a part of me.",Shadow of Love

Hurt by love.

So tell me what this is all about,
Your sudden change, and sudden doubt?
Baby, I gave you everything I had,
And everything you asked of me, and more, and more.

And there are sometimes, maybe often times,
I sit here, all alone,
Wishing you were home with me.
And there's sometiems, often in my mind, 
I wish you'd stay away,
'Cause I can't take the pain you bring me. 
Sometimes.

You told me that you'd never loved this 
Way before,
And that nobody ever gave you what you were
Looking for.
And you told me that no one would ever take
My place,
Beside you, here, beside you.

So tell me what this love's all about,
'Cause your changing ways I could do without.

That this just wouldn't be forever.

I wish that I could see,
Who's to blame.

[Chorus]
Without you, where do I belong?
Without you, how can I go on?
No love but yours will ever do;
Tell me how am I supposed to live my life without you?

Was I lost in you and me,
To the point I couldn't see?
That what we had was dying.
Now it's all that I can do,

To see photographs of you,
And stop myself from cryin'.
I should learn to live without your love;
Got so many memories, but it's not enough.

I feel helpless, and oh, so, all alone;
Like I've never felt before.
You made me feel alive,
But I don't remember what it's like anymore.

We said we'd take it day by day

Then you stole my heart away
I thought we'd come to some kind of understanding
I thought that our love was more than a miss

You started something
I'm begging you to stay

You know you'll turn away

You just can't walk away

I never said i had all the answers
To the questions in your heart
You shouldn't start things that you can't finish
Now you're breaking us apart

Just because we're dancing
Doesn't mean that we're romancing too
Boy I hardly know you - so I have to show you

That it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get all what you want from me
It takes more than one night
Wait till the time is right
And right now I wanna - pump it - pump it - pump it

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night long
But the pants stay on!

My reputation says, I'm not one for hesitation
But when it comes to - sex - I'm very, very patient

Boy it's not as easy as it seems to be
To get into my pants without getting into me
Now you know - this girl ain't no hoe
The pants stay on till I say so

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want
Hurt me, hurt me
You can work my body all night along
But the pants stay on!

All I need is time to get to know you better
Dancing's all that's on my mind - tonight

Hurt me, hurt me
I know you wanna take me home
But Baby, that's not what I want

Nothing's gonna stop me now",Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now
Samantha Fox,"Just a handful of heroes, waving flags across the world
Fast food and freedom, iron hand in velvet glove
For a fistful of dollars, anything at a price
It's always a gamble, say your prayers and roll the dice
History, for you and me, stretchin' out miles and miles
Liberty, equality, that's never going out of style (yeah)

(spirit of america) that's the spirit of america
Doin' okay just a heartbeat away
(spirit of america) that's the spirit of america
You burn from coast to coast
(spirit of america) that's the spirit of america



It's everybody's dream, there's a new tomorrow, now

The last lonesome cowboy, turns to make his final stand
Tall in his saddle, burning rifle in his hand
Now his world is a memory, and the freeway takes him home
Too tired and weary, for the man to stand alone

Reaching out, pushing hard, findin' your way at last
Shakin' loose, breakin' through, build a future from the past (yeah)

History for you and me, stretchin' out miles and miles
Liberty, equality, that's never going out of style (yeah)
