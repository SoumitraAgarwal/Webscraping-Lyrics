Ovid Alexis,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 
With his song",Killing Me Softly
Ovid Alexis,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (you are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
(You and me) I am here to stay

For you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
For I am here with you though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone not alone, oh",You Are Not Alone
Ovid Alexis,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love
Owen,"I've got nothing to say
I've got building block for teeth
And a tube sock, for a tongue

I can't do anything 
I can't do my hair right
Or have a good time
Or fall asleep, 
With my girl

If you don't wanna see
The worst in me
You've got two choices: 
Cover your eyes, 
Both hands tight
Or, just leave

I don't know what I think
I'm unsure
That I could or couldn't 
Care, less or more
About everyone 
I do or don't know 

If you don't wanna be
With a dead beat like me
I won't blame you
I won't blame you
I won't blame you

If you don't wanna see
The worst in me
You've got two choices
Cover your eyes
Both hands tight
Or just leave.",Declaration of Incompetence
Owen,"A head that aches doesn't have to stay that way, just let what's dead go. I know there's pain in leaving things all too well. In time, you'll find needing things only kills you slowly. If you're not sure who you are, you're not alone. If you're not sure what you want, you're not alone. If you're not sure of life of love (?), you're not alone. Tell your friends, hey come on over and talk. You bring the drinks, I'll bring the bad mood. Everyone feels like you. Tell your dad to come on over and we'll talk, you bring your drinks, I'll bring the fuck you's. Long awaited, long overdue. Tell your ex-girlfriend you need her to be there at bedtime. Cause you can't sleep your minds on all these things. Bring out what's dead and dying (something) while you still can.",Everyone Feels Like You
Owen,"Who's going the right way down a wrong way street? Who's making a mistake each time our mouths meet? You're smart and kind and easy on my eyes. I know it feels good, that's why we shouldn't tonight. Who's waiting for answers from a boy who can't speak? Will be holding their breath until their blue in the cheeks. You're smart and kind and you're too easy on my eyes. I know it feels good, so good, we should tonight. Cause maybe my mom's right, good deeds won't save us, just true faith in Jesus. So in the name of her lord lets do what we shouldn't some more.",Good Deeds
Owen,"I'm not going anywhere tonight, because of something said. I know, I know, it was meant well, but it still hurt like hell. Its OK, its alright its just that I'm a little tired of fading interest, of boys and girls. You know me and, you know me and I wanna say, I'm gonna say, I'm not the same, maybe in time. I'm not making promises in life cause of something I did tonight. My best friend, that was way back when. Not anything was everything then. I know it's not fair to the fairest of them all (you know who you are). I've got your picture on a mirror on my wall. I know you and, I know you and, but you wanna say in the worst of ways that I'm afraid and maybe too late. I'm not going anywhere tonight cause I don't want to, I don't have to. It's my right to be a fucking baby sometimes.",I'm Not Going Anywhere Tonight
Owen,"Long night 
Last call
Bloodshot eyes from some drinks too tall
Breathe in deep and I swear to god I'll die 
If I go home alone tonight.

I raise my head slow hoping to find 
A girl I don't know,
Who wouldn't mind showing a good time,
To feeling alright with 
Doing something we might 
Regret in the morning.

You, in a cardigan, 
You're tired of all your friends.
You, in love with the cock-toed twins, 
You're bored with your boyfriend.

I want to be with you tonight, 
With our legs crossed, our tongues tied.
Which one of you poor souls 
Wants to drive me home?

I swear to god I'll die 
If I go home alone tonight.",Poor Souls
Owen,"I spend most days in this bed that I abuse,
On these pillows that you can't get used to.
I spend entire days putting off that which can't wait
Until I'm knee deep in my own waste.

And I think that I'm justified 'cause I've seen what trying's done for those who've tried.

I spend most days in this bed too small for two,
Misplacing time like I've got it to lose.
I spend endless days thinking of all the different ways that we make love.

And I think that I'm justified 'cause I've seen what living's done for those alive.
(little to none, little to none)

I spend entire days in this bed too small for two,
On these pillows that you can't get used to.
And that's why I don't sleep at night 
And that's why I don't feel right in this city 
It's more me than you.",Bed Abuse
Owen,"You go and I'll stay. Why would I put clothes on to see some guy you like more than me? But you should go and I'll be ok. I promised myself I'd finally start that book I've been meaning to read about the French Revolution.

You go and I'll stay. Why would I leave the house to go see some guy who sings better than me? And you come home to me smelling like booze, humming his tunes. I'm rolling over and it's lights out for this lightweight.",Lights Out
Owen,"Put your faith in me my friends. 
That one day I'll find a way 
to give all the things that you've given to me back. 

Well, put your foot down my brother. 
That's no way to live putting the needs of others ahead of yours. 
You deserve more than nothing.

It's the little things that we do that mean anything. 

Put your hands on me my love, 
While the world wakes up early and wastes the day 
Working for money they don't need, 
to buy ting they don't need. 
We'll sleep in, We'll do it again.

It's the little things that we do that mean anything.","Put Your Hands on Me, My Love"
Owen,"You put on your raincoat
'Cause it looks like it just might today
And you grab your keys
You're out the door
Before you know where you're going.

If blame, as they say, is for god and little kids
Then you're deserving of praise or a slap on the wrist
'Cause you can't help but blame yourself
For your long face

Not a day passes that you don't fold your hands
And ask St. Francis to find the lust for life
That you lost when she left
With your tongue and your last breath
She's a thief with an eye for nice things

Not a day passes that you don't close your eyes
And ask St. Francis to find the love of your life
That you lost when she left
You dumb fuck, your life's a mess
Without her to tell you what to say
Or when to breathe
Or what you'll need
Or where you're going.",She's a Thief
Owen,"Tell me again what you were thinking when (when you were...) you got that bruise tattooed, forever black and blue. You won't say, like you don't say anything anyone can hold you to. I hope I don't make the same foolish mistakes I know you've made because I can see me in the things that you don't say, people that you don't see.

Tell me again where you were when (where you were...) the world changed and forgot about you. If it's sympathy you need then I'm sorry but you're not the only one who feels cheated. It's too close to home and it's too near the bone, more than you'll ever know...

I don't miss you. I'll miss you when you're dead.",That Tattoo Isn't Funny Anymore
Owen,"I'm usually not one to speak out
But your decisions of late are on all accounts
Pretty fucked up
And not in a good way

And I heard about you and that Elli
If even half of it?s true then I'm not surprised that you've been
Kicking yourself to sleep

Oh, and who pulled who's hair on who's head
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did

Well, I heard about you and Elli
If even half of its true then I'm ashamed of you
And your sense of loyalty

Oh, and who found who's hair in who's bed?
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did

Oh, and who found who's hair in who's bed?
Well, I?ll tell you that it?s told me more of you
Than you did
",Who Found Who's Hair in Who's Bed?
Owen,"Lets just forget, everything said. Everything we did.
Best friends, better halves
Goodbyes, and the other night, we realized,
We were falling out of love
There were some things, that were said, that weren't meant
They never did
The last thing I want to be is overly dramatic
I just think its best
Cause you can't miss what you forget
So lets just pretend
Everything and anything
Between you and me
Was never meant



",Never Meant
Owen,"Just between
You and me
I don't know what I'm doing here
In your room

Close to you
Full of shit and free beer
My brother the bartender
I tip him well and I drink for free

He takes good care of me
He takes care of me
Anyway I'm here
I'm a bicycle

I'm too tired to ride home
If it's okay with you
Can I take off these shoes?
And stay the night

Just between
You and me
This thing between you and me
Might not be anything worth singing about
Or it might be just what I need

Someone to take my mind off things
At the end of a long day
Someone to take my pants off me
At the end of a long night
Either way we're here

We're 2 bicycles ridden
Too tired to move
Which one of us two
Is dumb enough to choose
The other as a lover",Breaking Away
Owen,"Alone on the train, you're running towards or maybe away from a reason to wake each morning. Your thoughts again drift towards us and what we have and haven't become. Your head shakes and you think ""never again."" It's true what they say about fools who leave too soon, they don't ever really move on. Put your hand in your bag and pull out the Carver book you grabbed before leaving. And then you realize in this too she was right. You make an excuse, you make up a lie. So what's left of your soul like the best friend you just sold to sleep? Easy at night. It's true what they say about fools who speak too soon, they don't ever really know what they're getting into or out of. You're on your way, the taste of blood from a bitten tongue. You're in need of some new teeth that won't cave in.",Gazebo
Owen,"I eat with these crooked teeth
Tomato soup and grilled cheese
But you already know that because you used to dine with me
Do you remember?

I listen to my same old cds
New Order & Morrissey
But you already know that because you used to ride with me

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
But the song about you keeps coming out

I sleep in these dirty sheets
A blanket between my bony knees
But you already know that because you used to crawl in bed with me the morning before work

Put your hands on my back
Kiss the back of my neck

I thought I'd be singing a different tune by now
But the song about you keeps coming out
I'd hoped to be singing to someone new by now
But the songs about you keep coming out","In the Morning, Before Work"
Owen,"As your lover, 
I have my doubts that you kiss your mother with that mouth. 
You put it on me. 
Up and down me. 
We had a good time crossing those lines. 
Now that we're friends, 
It's becoming more and more clear 
That your vampire boyfriend isn't going anywhere. 
You put me on. 
You put on a good show.

(At least I can see myself in the mirror.)",That Mouth
Owen,"Whatever it is you think you are
You aren't:
A good friend, unique, well-read
Good-looking, or smart
Well now you know

well I hate to be the one to bear such bad news
I know it hurts to hear
But it's true
You don't mean anything
To anyone but me
And even I think
That you're blinded by conceit
So now you know

free beer
And basement shows
Don't mean you've made it
It's what you do
Not who you were, what you wear, where you've been
So do something

whoever you think is watching you dance
From across the room
They aren't
If anything, they feel sorry for you
'cause you try so hard

I know it hurts to hear
But it's the truth
So you might as well hear it
From a friend
You're a has-been
That never was
I know it's mean to say
But it's something I've been meaning to say to you
For a while
You're a has-been
That never was
Or will be



",Bad News
Owen,"We bonded over broken bones
Whose broke skin, whose fractured in two places, and whose hurt the most
We bonded over broken bones
How many Vicodin we took before bed, how many we sold to the band sleeping on our floor
Week one of a two week tour
God knows, they'll need it more than us

You and me, an X-ray machine
I swear that day you saw straight through me

We're two bags of bones broken and talking of people we both know in common
Amongst other things that I shouldn't mention

You and me, a hospital love scene
If only these broken bodies were ours forever",Bags of Bones
Owen,"You know what you are to me
Don't make me say it over and over again
It's way too late
Or much too early
You know how I get
When I'm left alone to my vices
Like the grown-ups did when I was a kid

I said: I'm a bird in your hand so take me as I am
You know what you are to me
Don't make me say it over and over again
My left hand, a part of me
It stays late to clean up my mess
When I'm sick of all my choices
Like the grown-ups I grew up with

angels and addicts
When I put my arms around you
I mean it
When I'm too drunk to stay up with you
I mean it
When I slam doors 'cause I'm pissed at you
I mean it
When I put on a suit and say ""I do""
I mean it

Owen,"Here she comes, you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true, it's not hard to realize
Look into those false colored eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down, what a clown

Everybody knows
(She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to me
(She's a femme fatale)

She's just a little tease
(She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're written in her book number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown

Owen,"One of these days I'll make some money
And buy myself those things that I want:
Acrylic paints, acoustic guitar strings, a new bicycle seat
For my ride over to your house each night
And one of these days I'll get a real job
One that actually pays
Like my dad had

you know my father, the bartender
Used to wear a suit to work
Before he hit the drink,
The old man used to do a lot of things

one of these days I'll give up
And give in to the man



",One of These Days
Owen,"Could you love someone enough
After all you've had and you've lost?
It's a simple question
I'm only asking 'cause I don't want to die alone

could you love someone completely?
And yes, by ""someone"" I mean me
Spoiled sick like milk you let sit too long
It's a simple question
As I lie awake waiting for you to lay beside me
I can almost hear the sad waltzes of Pietro Crespi

could you love someone who does whatever he wants to do
Whenever I want to?
It's a simple question
I'm only asking 'cause I don't want to die alone



",The Sad Waltzes of Pietro Crespi
Owen,"Those books you've read in your youth,
Like holidays at home
Continue to remind you
Of who you were
And who you are

some pages bent,
The spines creased and worn
All signs of being adored
And those words somehow meant more to you
Than who they were written for

those blankets in your bed
So tattered and sad
They've seen enough sleepless nights
Both good and bad
To pen a short story
Use your words
For a few love songs
Well ain't it about time
You've moved on

those books that you've read
You will read again
After enough time passes
You'll remember some names
But not how they end
After enough time passes
And your heart will break all over again
After enough time passes
And so on and so forth



",Use Your Words
Owen,"Bad backs and hardwood floors
I'm so sick of waking up sore
Not knowing where I am
And this was a lot of fun
When the music meant something to someone
That didn't have a girlfriend
Well somehow, getting out the same way that the earth moves around the sun
I won't stray too far, or be gone too long

windows and doorways, I don't know which way
To leave this room because I'm afraid of heights
And I'm afraid of you tonight
Those striped socks and punk rock pajamas
Some ways I changed, in most ways I'm the same

for better or worse I can't say
Only time will tell
Like an addict, I'm cursed in a good way
I've done it so long and I'm not sure how not to

the same way that the earth moves around the sun will be gravity
Pulls on everyone
Dead beats and dead friends
My god, when will it end?

And a tendency towards negligence.
Just petty thieves and addicts,
That don't hurt anyone
But they'll burn anyway.

Well sometimes, 
Like every time 
A train passes,
I get jealous of the long nights,
And blurred lights,
The red eyes,
The bar fights.

And how did I get here?
And which way to the nearest train?

Like every time she breathes,

And all the good times to come.

Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you

Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?

Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier

Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone

Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
The high tide could take me so far away
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align

We were the crashing whitecaps
On the ocean
And what lovely seaside holiday, away
A palm tree in Christmas lights
My emotion
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains

Walking down by the bay
On the shore, staring up at the planes

Around my arms and began
To shiver violently before

And see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark

When we're apart what ever are you thinking of
If this is what I call home why does it feel so alone
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk
In the deep, so I can hardly relax
Or even oversleep
I feel as if I were home, some nights
When we count all the ship lights
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

And I'll kiss you, between the ears,

If you're my girl,
Swirl me around your room with feeling,
And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling,
Will shine for us,
As love sweeps over the room,
Cause we tend to make each other blush (you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind (troubles far behind),
But I still have just one more question on my mind,
For all my pals who live in all the oceans and the seas,
With fronds like these well, who needs anemones?

You're the bird and I'm the worm,
And it's plain to see that we were meant to be

I smooth my hair,

As he shakes my hand and practically laughs at me,

And with a smirk he says ""don't have a fit,
This will just pinch a bit""

Lose their patience

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight to me,
And now my vision can render the scene,
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris,
Happiness returned to me through a grave emergency.
The curtains decayed, the daylight poured in,
I was never afraid, of the darkness again,
My burns were third degree,

But I'd been set free,
'Cause grace had finally found its way to me.

Owl City,"Ladies and gentleman,
Today is a day for mourning and remembering
They had a hunger to explore the universe
And discover its truths and
They had that special grace
That special spirit that says give me a challenge
And I'll meet it with joy

The crew of the space shuttle challenger
Honored us in the manner
Of which they lived their lives
We will never forget them
As they prepared for their journey
And waved goodbye
And they slipped the surly of earth
To touch the face of God.","January 28, 1986"

And sheets on the tables and chairs,
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink,

Daisies to push through the floor,
And I wish that plant life would grow all around me,
So I won't feel dead anymore.

I saw a bear in the den,
Reading my textbooks again,
That bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic,
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend.

The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time,
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus,
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?

And give me a ghost of a smile,
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're teddy beneath,

Of this old haunted house,

All the spider webs to grow all around me,

Owl City,"I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,
Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet.
And you blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings,
To gaze down on the city below, ablaze with wondrous things.
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.
I wouldn't wanna live there.

Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies,
I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes.
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.
From the green belt balcony, the wildfires look so pretty.
Ponderosa canopy, I'd never leave if it were up to me.
To the ruby redwood tree, and to the velvet climbing ivy:
Painted all mahogany, I'd never leave if it were up to me.

With a starry brush, paint the dusk Venetian blue,
Because in the evening hush, you'll never believe the view.
And when the leaves return and their whisperings fill the night,
They'll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide.
Where fire and ice collide.

Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace, will the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn't want to live there.
I wouldn't want to live there.

My rock candy passion is bittersweet
And armed to the teeth
'Cause she would rather fall in chocolate
Than fall in love
Especially with me

I stood under the waterfall
With a kiwi-pineapple parasol
As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball
And made a concrete cavern
A caterpillar concert hall

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of papier-mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

I would rather go swimming
With great white sharks
Than wade in romance
'Cause I can never find the courage
To ask her to dinner
Or even to dance
(Dance in the moonlight)

Don't sweat under your overcoat
'Cause my heart can harbor this paddle boat
You'll hit the bottom of the highest note
And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna
Leave your throat

And plug in the partyin' lights
Soak your cares in the solar flares
That light up these island nights
Orange eclipse I can taste your lips
In the citrus afternoon
If you can fly don't stop at the sky
'Cause there's footprints on the moon

Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears,
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on,
But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.

'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

And hung above our lids too flushed to blink,
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold.

Beneath the sand
The white windy waves washed in
But I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again
'Cause I'm on and off inside

And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream
When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea
I wrenched the engines off
And dragged them down
The depths turned the iron soft
As they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side
To its rusty knees

Owl City,"I'm tired of waking up in tears,
'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain;
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?
I'm a Silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home
I'm sick of the past I can't erase,
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace,
The mountains of things that I still regret,
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget
(No matter where I go)

The fire I began, is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die
I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?

So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go

'Cause I walk alone, no matter where I go

The starry nights without a fear of heights
I can't recall, but I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn

Before she left, had me so convinced

Owl City,"A spark soaring down through the pouring rain
And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow motion wave on the ocean
Stirs my emotion up like like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to skydiver
Then to survivor,
Dying to breakdown
A blood brother, surrogate mother,
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
Locked in the attic
Strung out and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard,
So hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose and rose higher
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

We all suffer but we recover
Just to discover life where we all are

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive

Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

So hard, so hard

'Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero, she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

But nobody knew he was dying inside

Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go

From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream

So misunderstood 'till the bloody end

Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter

It's do or die, and this is mine

It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time

Watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, Zack Morrison
The first cell phone, it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Cat, pogs, and floam and home alone, Berenstein bears and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-sketch
What happens next?
Grape juicy juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip-n-slides, McDonalds Fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable

It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

It’s unbelievable
When I think back on my name

It ruled in so many ways
It’s unbelievable, it’s unbelievable

With two kids and another on the way
And the coach I hardly recognized
His thick black hair has slowly turned to grey

Have taken kids on to raise

When I find myself romancing now
The way that it used to be
I can't help thinking someday
That it's coming back to me
And I never was the kind
To see the forest forming trees

Never was my favorite thing to do
But that's okay it's just as well

Ox,"Carolinah, do your lips still taste like strawberry wine,
Summer air, and chamomile?
When you pass by, do the stars still stop and look in your eyes?
I know just how they must feel.
In the morning, do you still rise like a flower, child,
And shake the nighttime from your hair?
In the twilight hours, do you get up and take a morning shower?
I'd give anything to be there.
Carolinah, let's get higher.
Hold my hand and understand:
Whatever I love I call my home.
Carolinah
Close your eyes and remember the starlit sky.
Did your boyfriend leave you alone?
And in the morning, do you still rise like a flower, child,
And shake the nighttime from your long, dark hair?
Would it be all right to call on you some summer night?
Just say the word, and I'll be there.
Hold my hand.
Whatever I love I call my home.
I'm a man and you're my summer daydream girl.

Oxmo Puccino,"T'es comme une bougie
Qu'on a oublié d'éteindre dans une chambre vide
Tu brilles entouré de gens sombres voulant te souffler
Celui qui a le moins de jouets
Le moins de chouchous
Celui qu'on fait chier
Le cœur meurtri et meurtrière est ta jalousie
L'enfant seul se méfie de tout le monde, pas par choix
Mais dépit, pense qu'en guise d'ami
Son ombre suffit
Une solitude qui te suit jusque dans le sexe
Mon texte coupe l'enfant seul en deux espèces
Ceux qui baisent à l'excès mais souhaiteraient se
Fixer à une femme plutôt qu'à mille fesses
Quand l'autre sorte écoute souvent la même
Chanson dans le poste, et porte le deuil d'une
Relation morte et reste l’œil humide
La tête baissée laisse le cœur sur l'estomac
L'estomac sur les genoux, ma tristesse n'a d'égale
Que le coup de gueule muet de l'enfant seul
Que nul ne calcule

T'es l'enfant seul (je sais que c'est toi)
Viens-tu des bas-fonds
Ou des quartiers neufs?
Bref, au fond tous la même souffrance

Ou des quartiers neufs?
Bref, au fond tous la même souffrance

Mes mots s'emboîtent les gens s'y voient comme dans une flaque d'eau
Ça leur renvoie un triste reflet, mais est-ce ma faute?
T'es l'enfant seul c'est pas facile, on se comprend
Peu le savent
Que je le sache ça te surprend
Il mate par la vitre la solitude qui le mine
Fait passer la quinine pour un sucre
Faut être lucide, il faut qu'on se libère, disent-ils
Ils n'en discutent pas, confondent la rime et l'acte
La fuite et le suicide, un pacte, une promo sans tract
Pas trop de mots no body n'a capté le sale souhait
L'envie de se laisser par le cou pendu
Pour punir les parents qui, pour aimer l'enfant
Ont trop attendu, car si l'amour est une course
L'enfant naît c'est le départ en tête, l'embêtement
Comme passe-temps en fait des parents bêtes!
Maîtrise lancinante, sentiments en ciment sinon
Dans six ans on me retrouve ciseaux dans le crâne
Dans le sang gisant

T'es l'enfant seul (dis-moi que c'est toi)

T'es l'enfant seul (je suis sûr que c'est toi)
Viens-tu des bas-fonds

Bref, au fond tous la même souffrance

L'enfant seul c'est l'inconnu muet du fond de classe
Celui de qui l'on se moque, rond comme
Coluche, ou le boss dans le hall, au groupe
Massif, l'os dans le steak haché - plantant
Chaque postulant à son poste
Vu que les conneries de gosses des rues couvrent
Souvent un jeune qui souffre d'un gros gouffre affectif
Grandir sans père c'est dur
Même si la mère persévère
Ça sert mais pas à trouver ses repères c'est sûr!
Perdre sa mère c'est pire! Demande à Pit je t'assure
T'as pas saisi enlève la mer de la Côte D'Azur
Quand ces gosses poussent leur souffrance aussi
Nous savons tous que personne ne guérit de son enfance
Même un torse poilu ne peut oublier sa vie de
Gosse du divorce rossé par son beau-père

Oxmo Puccino,"En quelques rimes je viens poser des roses
L’arme à la main, mais sans qu’tout ça m’alarme
Je flippe quand même du paradoxe
Et puis quand j’en lé-par à Ox
Y’m dit « viens on fait un morceau entre gun et rose »
C’est l’intifada dans les cœurs
Dans les têtes c’est vie d’film
Entre flingues et roses, on est tous victime
De ces sentiments qui s’mêlent
Même posé il y a des contrats qui s’fêlent
Comme une pluie de grêle en été
Fragile comme du cristal
La ligne s’brise aussi vite que j’kique un freestyle.
Comme ce type plein de haine
Tuant sa femme par amour
Plein de regrets, plein de peines
Les yeux mouillés devant le Cour d’Assise
Chacun ses démons, quand l’diable nous fait dé-ban 
A tous la force nous fait défaut
Et c’est chaque fois le même défi
Suivre le bien alors qu’le mal
nous met tous en appétit

2ème couplet

Tantôt aigri ou tantôt heureux de vivre
Ca dépend d’la lumière que j’veux bien laisser entrer
Dans c’qui m’sert de cerveau en fait il n’y pas plus trop d’heure de libre
Pour une suite d’idées claires et sensées
C’est rarement blanc ou noir, bien ou mal, flingue ou rose
C’est jamais clair même quand les zin-cou causent

De bain douche, de bain de foule
D’plein d’coup, de plein de fouf
Comme partout besoin de sous.

3ème couplet

regarde comme le quartier regorge
d’enfants doués, carrières trouées
parce qu’on mélange vice et vertu
d’où es-tu toi pour douter, noué, 
l’estomac vide, les yeux vitreux
tout est flouté
Malgré ça j’perd pas d’vue que
Les roses ici sont épineuses, laissant plus d’ecchymoses
Qu’un flingue enrayé, grillé parce que dès qu’il ose
Recommencer 
Une fois la gâchette ankylosée, tu sais comment c’est
C’est pour ça qu’j’mets de l’amour dans ma vie
Afin de noyer ma haine
Et si donc aujourd’hui j’décide de broyer ma peine
C’est que c’est bien plus près de
L’odeur des roses, que je veux vivre
Mais toujours un calibre sous l’oreiller.",Un Flingue et des Roses
Oxmo Puccino,"Lyrics apaisants je rappe les oiseaux se taisent 
Fais-toi plaisir, écoutes ça avec ta daisy 
Ce matin j'suis bien dans ma peau, j'ai la pêche telle cette femme qui 
Dame des parts de tartes par dizaines 
Te dis pas frappé par un maléfice 
Recommences ta vie à zéro quand je la redémarre à moins dix 
Je suis né blasé sans un sous, 
Puis brassé me suis retrouvé sans issue 
J'suis rentré en collision avec mes obstacles 
Tourne le pire à la dérision, l'offre en spectacle 
Je me dois de tout tuer pour ceux qui n'ont pas le choix 
Ma chanson va pas sauver le monde, tant pis pour cette fois 
Si j'avais entendu les profs, je serais pas le type 
Dont on étudie l'écriture laisses les rire, faire mon truc 
Je me suis fixé ce but si j'arrive à mi-chemin 
Je ferai date comme ce tigre tué par un caniche nain 
Tu connaîtras jamais la fin de l'histoire 
En faisant demi-tour à deux minutes de la victoire 
On peut viser ton blé, ta femme et son vison 
Mais, qui peut se vanter d'avoir touché l'horizon 


J’irai plus loin que l’horizon 
C’est bien mieux que le bout de son nez 
Tous les murs qui nous bloquent brisons 
Avances et laisses-les klaxonner 
Viens, la vitesse de mon son frisons. 


Je me sens encore de ceux sur qui nul ne miserait 
Autant de chapitres que de poils possède un bison 
J'enchaîne les brochettes de problèmes, uppercut, eskive, crochet 
Le revers de la médaille c'est mon emblème 
Tu déconnes avec tes tonnes de projets 
Ils vont encore s'entasser avec ceux de l'année prochaine 
Viens, j'ai fait le plein de patience, 
Y'a assez d'essence pour rouler jusqu'à l'horizon 
Qui m'aime me suive 
Amène les cuivres, les guitares 
Du pain et de l'huile d'olive 
Le seul raccourci et ma potion, ne suis pas les panneaux 
Aucun n'indique la bonne destination action laisses-moi kiffer ma passion 
M'échapper car à chaque page des marionnettes rêvent qu'on m'isole hélas 
Plus on est de fous on évite la camisole 
J'te fais plein de feintes, pas de ceux qui démissionnent
Le plan se trouve en bas à gauche juste après do ré mi sol 

(refrain)",Toucher l'Horizon
Oxmo Puccino,"Quand le chagrin s’évapore et laisse place aux décombres, 
Je puise à la surface de ce que j'ai de plus sombre 
Un soir à son chevet, l'amour m'a dit laisse petit 
Ne fais pas ce titre, ta musique est sinistre, 
Je lui ai répondu du tac au tac, je serai seul à ton enterrement 
Donc je serai ton ministre, pas celui qui milite, ni le bouc émissaire 
Désormais il fera nuit sur les deux hémisphères, 
Il ne te reste que quelques heures à vivre, après la fin du monde, 
Il faudra se contenter d'autre chose, pour que nos coeurs vibrent
T'abordes une jolie, racontes pas ta vie, négocies 
C'est ce dont il s'agit dès que la queue s'agite 
Assis, j'ai cogité comme l'eau se paye, 
Voici l'écrasante vérité pour tes orteils 
On ne prouve rien à ceux qui disent que l'amour est mort 
Aimer d'accord, mais l’arrangement d'abord 

La mélodie n'est pas marrante 
Faut que ça rentre, l'amour est mort, mais 
C'est pas moi s’il est dead 
Vas comprendre et prends le comme ça t'arrange 
L'amour est mort, mets bien ça dans ta tête ! 

C'est formel, l'amour est mort mais c'est pas moi qui l'ai tué 
Devrais-je en faire une belle chanson que le public puisse se ruer 
Faudrait pas se tromper de fautif c'est 
Vous qui ne pouvez vivre ensemble sans vous pifrer, 
Trinquer sans critiquer son prochain
Incapable de se réconcilier, 
Malgré tous ces bons souvenirs, quelques bons conseillers 
Comment cela a-t-il pu advenir, là n'est plus la question, 
L'erreur est humaine, là n'est pas la réponse 
Il est clair que chaque altercation m'interpelle 
De celle du couple, à celles qui nourrissent Interpol 
Dans mes pages peu de messages d'espoir 
Juste une nouvelle histoire 
A ne pas croire 
Et si je dis n'importe quoi 
Vas-y vis une belle histoire 
Et je la raconterai c’soir 
Espèce d'enfoiré ! Cesses de blaguer

Quand mars keuss apparaissent dans ma tv

Sur ma desperado moto quelle chance je capte

Sale karateka de black desperado, on aura ta peau, fallait rester sur ta moto

Et que si je voulais y aller fallait passer par son corps

Sens que ça va barder jsuis trop speed, 
J'esquive sa gauche en finesse, 
En traître j'dégaine un lance roquettes

Je l'attrape par le cou, je le montre à ses messieurs 
Ces messieurs me disent trempez le dans l'huile

Ne pleure plus c'est moi, je suis venu te délivrer

Nous voilà dans la salle atmosphère glauque 
Le rap francais baillonné par terre, frôle l'agonie 
Un public déçu me cerne 
Un couplet dans le chargeur, dites-moi comment tenir un concert 
Un dernier regard au rap français 
Et je m'élance à l'avant de la scène, mic en avant

Chaque mot doit toucher sa cible 
Si ma vocale en traverse dix 

Je vise même le trapéziste

Des phrases connes qui sonnent 
Appelles-moi aussi joe l'astuce. 
Ce qui se passe t’y penses pas

Il a mal aux pieds, boite et danse à cloche pattes 
On remercie qui ? Qui ? 
Mais où est le black despe

enterré, puis ressuscité 

trêve de plaisanterie 


 je suis le cactus de Sibérie 

peu m'ont vu de près, 

la crème de la crème une espèce unique. 

les gens adorent les couleurs flamboyante pas ceux qui les portent 

raison pour laquelle tu ne me verras pas dans un parc 

plutôt de nuit garé dans un parking, en train de smoke entre cactus 

j'essayais de faire une place la ou la glace ne fonds pas 

j'ai quitté la queue, et gouter la mise à l'écart 

il pleut, il est tard, tout ce que m'inspire cet abribus 

cette habitude, me fait ressembler au cactus de Sibérie

tellement les pieds sur terre que j'ai pris racine, 

sous ce calme, des épines à la nitroglycérine. 

il s'avère qu'à la fontaine chacun veut trois verre de lait, 

je préfère rester là  planté à rapper aidez les ! 


j'aurais pu etre plus commercial qu'un bouquet de roses, 

si st valentin m'avais pas volé toutes mes proses 

de ceux qui n'attendent pas qu'on les arrose et durcissent 

le temps n'a pas déformé mes propos, ils murissent 

tu as perdu ta température des pyramides 

refroidis d'avoir fréquenté les pires amis 

tu peux aiguiser tes piquants tant que les gens veulent du piment 

va te frotter tu connaitras de nouveaux sentiments 





un jour tony m'as dit ox, t'as trouvé plus de joie 

dans la tristesse que toi dans la joie 

plus qu'un p'tit coup de pouce de l'exterieur 

mon flow réconforte ceux dont les pics poussent vers l'intérieur 

j'tire ta peine vers le haut 

que ton plaisir atteigne des sommets 

grimpe c'est moi le capitaine de ce bateau 

ma sève est mélodique , savais tu qu'un cactus avait une fleurs 

au milieu des piques se cache un cœur 

on t'as offert un cactus de sibérie 

en effet c'est moins pénible 

qu'un bouquet qui fane

se transforment en pétales

Tu fais des tunes, le jour ou t'es plus en vogue 
Creuser mes neurones, m’lever à l'aube, pas d'écarts connard 
Car j'ai capté tôt l'art de jacter, pas d’pot

""que le crime ne paie pas"",  le taf non plus ! 
A vingt ans j'ai fait à mon père et mes potes 
Fuck that shit, je me lance dans le rap 
Et pas le boogie-woogie, le hardcore 
Qui te casse le bras, tel David Douillet 
Et si y'a pas de sous, je m'en battais les douilles 
M'ont dit l'est fou lui, tant qu'y a la vibe aie aie aie 
Tenez le cap Abdoulaye, 
Sois pas désolé, Ox t'as pas fait platine 
Cousine, j'ai fait ma first rime sans un centime

La carotte est cuite, ma tranche fine 
La fin d'une vie d'artiste se peut discréditante 
Stylo posé je reprends mes distances

Mes potes soient fiers de moi, que mes fans me checkent 
Tant qu'on me félicite, maison de disque fait les chèques, 
Impossible de me suivre, j'ai défait l'échelle

J'voulais juste gagner des prix Nobel au moins des oscars 
Mon fan club suffit seulement d'aimer ce morceau pour y être

Maintenant tu donnes ! Mon deuxième album etait bénévole 
Autant de peine qu'en Sibérie, danse baby vole 
Et puis c'est si terrible, t'y croirais pas si c'est gratuit 
Les gens ont besoin de prix j'vais pas te le traduire 
Je suis venu quand même 
J'savais que t'avais pas mon pesos 
Tu l'as claqué avec une pale copie de Kate Moss 

Rend-moi mon pèze

Rends-moi ce que j'tai prêté, 
Et remonte ce truc, ou comment j'vais te traiter 
J'ai pas dit rends-moi ma baise, rends-moi pèze 
Perds tes habitudes, ou je donne ton nom 
O x mo ainsi ça s'épelle, tu ne peux test,

Après les booms, gros globe trotter dans les bars à tinpes 
J'ai connu l'argent du risque avant la sueur du taf 
Surtout le salaire de la peur avant celle du taf 
Humm, rends-moi en beaucoup, que je récupère un peu de ce qu'on 
M'a volé, on partagera mon pochon de skonk 
C'est thieb oujem pour mes amis,

J'en ai connu des belles, t'en as peut-être fait une mère 
Vous paierez plus que le puissiez 
Apprends que le pèze se paye au kilodrame 
On croque ta cuisse comme les huissiers 
Mon texte est grave, comme le pèze trop froid 
Tous les  chemins du pèze mènent au père Lachaise 
Train couchette bondé tu perds même la chaise

Rends-moi mon pèze",Mon Pèze
Oxmo Puccino,"Voici venue l’heure du crime

Officiellement dans les premiers appelés,
C'est ma soeur de couleur, j'ai scellé la porte et fondu la clé
Privé de sortie tes yeux sont gonflés
L'insomnie me poursuit quand t'as la chance de ronfler,
Remercie plutôt tes parents de s'inquiéter quand t'es pas rentré, 
C'est le crépuscule la crapule en toi sort d'entre parenthèses
L'ambiance est maléfique, tu te découvres un autre visage,
Tu changes d'accoutrement qui sait ce qui s'envisage,
Restes sourd à ses coups de fil
Où tes pieds décollent, suspendu au cou par un bout de ficelle
Découpez les fils, y’a plus de crédit, j'ai détruit l'antenne
Jetez la batterie, il sonne quand même
La nuit t'appelle
 
La nuit elle t'appelle pas par hey yo
Quel angoissant silence radio, 
T'es pas chez toi, non
T'es bien dans son royaume
Ce tourbillon dans tes boyaux, 
Je sais j'en suis resté éveillé des millions
Qui ne croyait pas aux fantômes
Lumière éteinte la pénombre
Te fait crier, ho non
Ce n'était que des ombres 
Tu dois avoir tes raisons
La nuit les hommes ne sont pas pareils
 

T'es ivre à blâmer et la nuit t'appelle
Elle t'attend au bout de la route armée de sa pioche, sa pelle
Les flashs me reviennent, coupent mon sommeil au scalpel
Je lui disais prends ce top model et réserve à l'hôtel
Préserves toi des cocktails où ton volant se bloque
Sous les forces invisibles au troisième virage
Arrive l'imprévisible, évites ces heures où le froid rôde
Caches tes émeraudes, secoues tes éperons, galopes vers le hall
Tu recomposes ton digicode, pourtant derrière toi y'a personne
Tes battements de coeur s'accélèrent comme si ta dernière heure sonne
Elle confond pas parler fort et être forte
Les yeux ouverts tu rêves de bruit lorsqu'elle chuchote
Les fenêtres claquent et les rideaux flottent
Le soleil fuit, les démons complotent
Lorsqu'elle m'appelle tant pis pour ma belle
Sur elle se replie la couette
Une feuille m'attend, roulons vers Black Poeto.


Le matin revenu, certains ont perdu la boussole
Aux jeux d'argent clandestins du deuxième sous-sol
C'est la nuit et son taux de viols
Du métal dans le coffre des bagnoles
Les babioles scintillent, les filles frivoles!
""n""ième passage à la douane espagnole
C'est l'heure de ""pointe"" donc les rames se vident
Je voulais pas rater le dernier d'une heure moins dix
A pied, pas fini de traverser la ville
Quartier sensible, les jeunes se font la guerre civile
La nuit porte conseil à la fin c'est elle qui décide
Elle t'appelle en traître dès que le jour se retire
Tu te demandais est-ce la dernière à l'aube c'est reparti pour un tour
Rien à faire à part attendre que le jour se lève
Avoir encore sommeil au réveil, et chercher l'oseille

(refrain)",La Nuit M'Appelle
Oxmo Puccino,"Ce matin j'ai condamné mon téléphone
J'lai mis en veilleuse entre deux querelles de ...
Des appels pour des compiles de merde
J'ai besoin d'un monde où les choses sont plus sérieuses
J'roule vers la BS direction un endroit périlleux
Si Columbo était français il aurait ma caisse
Mafia Tipo Fiat 91 poste cassette
Cette rue que t'as jamais vue
Sûrement parallèle à la tienne
Les mêmes sont là depuis la marelle
Un ptit créneau devant le café, non merci pas d'crème
J'vais chercher des croissants, j'reviens pas c't'aprèm
Aux amis la famille on m'commande un noisette
Bruit d'cartes qu'on pose, le smic se joue au poker
Au courant de tout c'qui se perpe T R E
J'ai tourné dans les banlieues avant le RER E
On prend des nouvelles : deux balles dans l'bide
Lui a pris deux ans, lui six mois
Une pensée au chinois
 
Refrain (scratch dj cream)
 
90 km/heures sur l'a 86
Cap sur le nord du 9.3, heure de l'apéritif
Poto, t'es pas un criminel, mais un trafiquant
Artisan d'matières premières, passe l'échantillon
Que je m'en fabrique un
Jeune au train d'vie étrange, kit mains libres branché
H 24 sans calibre, tu t'interroges au sujet d'ces grosses cylindrées
Série 7, Porsche, Ferrari, V6, Versace, St Prix
Demandes pas à quelle heure ils dorment
Si tu vas au taf ils sont déjà dehors
Parce qu'ils n'ont pas d'horaires 
Pour faire des ronds
Slalom entre balance et maisons de corrections
Là où se font les plus grosses connections
Gosses en manque d'affection
Tous sous la pression d'un monde parallèle
 
Refrain (scratch dj cream)
 
L'aiguille tourne sur le parking
On parle de rap ou rien du tout
De filles cools pas prises de tête
Ouvertes à tout
A ton insu venir peser tes grammes
On m'dit que tu passes
Quand ton livreur te met en rade
La plupart de mon temps à rien faire
R'garder les gens faire
Quand tu les entends parler
Tu reconnais les gangsters
Chuchotent plus de chiffres
Que de lettres
Ce chahut sur leur chiffre d'affaires
Ça s'taille, ressort les dossiers sexuels
Les premiers vexés 
Deviennent vite grossiers
Ainsi va en bas des immenses barres de béton
Tous en parallèle on s'rappelle
Quand j'ai l'temps, on fait la même
 
Refrain (scratch dj cream)",Parallèles
Oxmo Puccino,"Ce soir Billie ne chantera pas
Désolé pour vous ça ne l'enchante pas
Cupidon a tiré puisses-tu être robuste
Love tu tombes même avec des gros muscles

Partie sans crier gare et maintenant
On entend parler d'enlèvement, mais nous savons que
Dieu ne peut laisser Billie disparaître paraît-il
Lorsqu'elle chante la pluie s'arrête

On cherche celle qui n'a pas disparu
Cachée dans un café sous une perruque
Le videur l'a reconnue la laisse tranquille
La belle est loin pensive Billie s'fait son film

Elle vit son conte de fée
Tu veux vivre le conte de fée
Tu voulais vibrer
Je vais vous livrer
Un petit secret

C'était la fin de sa tournée au Japon
Ce soir Billie ne chantera pas

Je vais vous livrer ce petit secret
La vie devient c'que l'on en fait

Ce soir Billie ne chantera pas
Désolé pour vous ça ne l'enchante pas
Cupidon a tiré puisses-tu être robuste
Love tu tombes même avec des gros muscles

Partie sans crier gare et maintenant
On entend parler d'enlèvement, mais nous savons que
Dieu ne peut laisser Billie disparaître, paraît-il
Lorsqu'elle chante la pluie s'arrête

On cherche, celle qui n'a pas disparu
Cachée dans un café, sous une perruque
Le videur l'a reconnue, la laisse tranquille
La belle est loin, pensive, Billie se fait son film

C'était la fin de sa tournée au Japon
Elle l'a vu comme un chaton, on est dans ce 5 étoiles
Il la toucha d'un regard
Ignorant qu'elle était star, il lui sortit son char
Mademoiselle vous m'avez déclenché
Je viens du Val de Marne, mon coeur vient de se pencher
Aimez-vous les tulipes car je ne danse pas
Rendez-vous ce jeudi 30 je serai dans ce bar
Il lui fit croire qu'il taffait dans les cosmétiques
Tito pensait séduire une traductrice
Frustrés tellement ils se charmèrent
La prochaine nuit sera plus que charnelle
Pour vivre un conte de fée, il s'y fait tard
Mais tout peut arriver même au Lipopette bar

Elle vit son conte de fée
Tu veux vivre le conte de fée
Tu voulais vibrer
Je vais vous livrer
Un petit secret

Ce soir Billie ne chantera pas
Il y a des souvenirs que l'on oublie pas comme ça
Une poupée qui attend devant l'orphelinat
Tous convaincus que l'histoire finit mal
Très vite l'air est inquiétant
Bruit de verre, peur en dilettante
Yuri s'échappe arrive une odeur d'écharpe
Suivie d'une voix charmante
Mademoiselle vous m'avez déclenché
Amoureux mon coeur est tombé, 
Il s'est trop penché sur vous
Tito se tenait là, debout,
Une écharpe en soie blanche autour du cou
Billie l'estomac noué, bouche bée, 
Ca on l'a tous fait
En vivant son conte de fée

Je vais vous livrer ce petit secret, 
La vie devient ce que l'on en fait",Conte de Fee
Oxmo Puccino,"Très petits les enfants aiment perdre la tête
Les années passent, on recherche le vertige
Tout le monde a commencé pareil
Au détour d'une nuit sans merveille
De temps en temps, c'est devenu régulier
On commence à plusieurs ça devient singulier
Tu l'as dans la peau
Tu peux plus partager, plutôt nager parmi les piranhas
Comment quitter la pire nana
Si c'est pour perdre un peu de son nirvana

Nirvana, nirvana, viens faire une p’tite balade
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana,
Chacun son nirvana, nirvana, nirvana

Un garrot une connexion haut débit dans les veines
Couché sur l'ordi pour dormir sur MSN
Hypnotisé devant son moniteur
Déconnecté, il pourrait oublier Monica
Égoïste, touché d'astéroïde quitte à être
Hors la L.O.I, sportifs sous stéroïdes
Chacun ses parenthèses
Combien de sourires cachent la fournaise
Ce côté de toi que tu découvres, t'abîme
Te choque comme une tournante entre mineurs
Chéries qui se guérissent en faisant du shopping
Pères de famille qui mentent à ses copines
Dévoile-moi ton péché, j'ai rien à te reprocher
Quand on sait ce que l'homme vaut, 
On se ne fatigue pas à prêcher
Dans ce désordre mondial, sache que chaque mal
Est causé pour un nirvana

Nirvana, nirvana, viens faire une p’tite balade
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana,
Chacun son nirvana, nirvana, nirvana

Le bien nécessite un mal jamais on sera rassasié
Une fois c'est trop, mille fois c'est pas assez
Tu as juré d'arrêter, mais la vérité c'est que,
Tu ne fais que recommencer et recommencer sans cesse
Quand c'est bon, on réitère
Pour l'obtenir y'a plus de mère ni père
Tu as tout perdu aux dés, mauvais chiffres
Va réemprunter, parier, revivre l'ivresse
Cerveau en satellite, l'alphabet satanique
ABCD, MDMA, PSP, CC, GHB
Dans ce monde où tout peut s'acheter
Tu te sens libéré, t'as le rire bavard
Capturé par ton nirvana

Dédicace à ma maîtresse, Juana, Marie Juana",Nirvana
Oxmo Puccino,"Ce soir, la ville est déserte 
Toute la Terre est là, guichets fermés
Marmelade, public énervé
Température élevée, à minuit 
Pour les applaudissements même le jour se lève 
Mondiale est la retransmission 
Radio,  toutes les télévisions 
Des invités aussi connus que Cousteau
Plus de sponsors qu’un match de football
Des présidents à côté des bandits au premier rang
Chaque musicien prend soin de ses parents
Tout le monde s’est déplacé pour elle
Hélas quelqu’un manque à l’appel

Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Qu’aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas 
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas

On chuchote que la diva est malade
Caprice, kidnapping, tout y passe
Où est la beauté vocale, pour l’appel au calme
Les premières bagarres éclatent au bar 
Des fausses places circulent ce n’est pas réjouissant
Devant on se bouscule, y a des évanouissements
Le promoteur pleure, ça le rendrait mignon 
Si ses pertes n’atteignaient pas le million 
Ça fait un long moment que la loge est vide 
Le front du garde du corps devient humide 
Son agent qui parlait partout devient timide 
Le tôlier descend des verres dans le living 
Cinq milles personnes se posent la même question
Ce qui est sur c’est qu’on ne sait pas

Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas 
Qu’aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas

Cela n’arrive qu’une fois dans la décennie
Le public attend depuis minuit et demi 

Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas
Qu’aucune hypothèse ne s’écarte
Mais où est Billie ?
On ne sait pas
Au Lipopette ? sûrement pas

Tous obsédés par leurs petits ennuis
Peu s’interrogent comment se porte la lady

Mais où est Billie ?",Ou Est Billie?
Oxmo Puccino,"Il y a des jours qu’on attend plus que d’autres
Comme ce jour ou l’on marche vers le trône 
La cousine venue accompagner Kali 
Ce genre de fleurs que t’aimerais dans ton panier
Elle était superbe, rendait les hommes carnivores 
Un fantasme de peintre dans toutes ses formes
Les soirées people elle adore, cousine Billie fuit la foule 
Strass et paillettes la rendent  pas folle 
Mais Today, Kali passait l’audition ultime
Adieu les boulots de merdes, vive la musique !
On sait bien qu’elle va y arriver 
Quand on mise tout
Un rêve doit se réaliser, non

Perdre et gagner 
Savoir perdre, gagner
Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner 
Telle une triste mariée

Après 76 candidates, c’est le tour de Kali,
C’est parti pour la favorite
La beauté panique puis trouve la force
Elle entame la chanson, les yeux clignotent
Enchante le jury, sur c’est dans la poche
Au fur à mesure, les pieds battent la mesure
La cour est conquise, la voix s’élève et s’envole
Kali pilote, prestance de marquise 
Lorsqu’un jeune homme s’invite à l’inaperçu 
Chuchote les mots qui percutent, au visage du producteur
Qui enchaîne un saut d’humeur
Au lieu de la féliciter le chef du jury s’ excuse
Y a des capacités, mais on ne cherche plus, on a trouvé la perle
Veuillez pardonner, etc... laissez vos coordonnées
C’est bien gentil, mais lorsque ton rêve s’écroule
Les explications t’en as rien à foutre, 
Ce n’est pas pour aujourd’hui Kali
Quelquefois c’est ainsi 

Perdre et gagner 
Savoir perdre, gagner
Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner 
Telle une triste mariée

Kali pleurait plus qu’elle n’en pouvait 
Billie se mit à chanter pour détendre l’atmosphère
Doucement il se passe quelque chose de magique, 
Ceux qui sont de dos regardent en oblique
Billie est saisie, lorsque s’adresse à elle 
Cette voix d’homme pleine de courtoisie
Tenez ma carte, venez à ce rendez vous
Une voix comme la vôtre se réécoute,
Parole de producteur aucun doute
Je suis envoyé pour faire de vous la vedette
Billie tombe dans l'incompréhension
Kali sombre dans la déception 
Comment était ce possible
Kali, humiliée par sa propre famille
Quelle injustice, des larmes durcissent
Ainsi de suite, c’est perdre et gagner
Reperdre et gagner

Perdre et gagner 
Savoir perdre, gagner
Reperdre, gagner sans s’éloigner de soi-même 
Rare les épargnés
On peut à la fois perdre, gagner 
Telle une triste mariée",Perdre et Gagner
Oxmo Puccino,"Les enfants, je vais vous raconter l’histoire du lapin qui se prenait pour un lion 
Et qui après son arnaque pensait prendre l’avion 

Hey chérie ce soir je rentre avec deux billets d’avions
Prépare bagages et champagne, on part pour les Caraïbes
Si Yuri préférait Kali, le poker était sa passion
Voici les points clés de ma narration 
Il attendit qu’elle soit sous la douche pour aller aux toilettes
Où était dissimulée cette mallette 
Descendons voir ce que le frérot propose 
Un alibi tout droit sorti d’un cerveau  de guimauve
Une soirée entre potes loin des entrepôts
Yuri chipote, mais bon il était trop tôt 
On sait qui des deux eut la mauvaise idée de passer au Lipopette
Pour quelques verres à vider
Mais, quand on suit un plan il faut s’y tenir
Y a toujours d’un hic pour s’en souvenir 

Ce type s’était pris pour un félin 
Il avait assez, mais en voulait plus 
Ne course pas le lapin 
Aujourd’hui les chasseurs 
Remplissent ton chargeur
Avant la roulette russe

Assis de dos Pat Phil mélangeait 
Des cartes sur un tapis vert
Whisky plein le verre
J’ai un salaire à perdre, lança-t-il 
Que les chanceux se dépêchent 
L’argent, c’est volatil
Évidemment le frère voulut retenir Yuri 
Mais peut-on empêcher un scorpion de mourir Yuri 
Ne put résister à son vice 
La première mise fut de 800 billets
Il gagna le double, au lieu tailler
La vermine remise trois fois de suite
S’emmêle les pinces dans le jeux de Pat 
Coincé entre deux quintes Yuri termine
Par perdre les billets, et les clés de sa berline
Ça fait longtemps que Pat Phil attend ce moment 
Autour du Yuri, le piège se ferme doucement 
Le sourire de Pat nous renseigne
C’est là que la mallette entre en scène

Yuri s’était pris pour un félin 
Il avait assez, mais en voulait plus
Ne course pas le lapin
Aujourd’hui les chasseurs
Remplissent ton chargeur 
Avant la roulette russe

Dans la rue n’accumule les dettes auprès de personne 
Ou tu perds la vie au-dessus d’une certaine somme
Et comme vous Yuri tenait à la sienne 
Obligé de couper en deux le coup du siècle   
Écoute Pat, retiens ce mot de passe,
Mets ce chapeau, mon frère t’accompagne, prends l’adresse
Trois hommes vous attendent à l’entrepôt, oui 
Tu fais l’échange, ramène l’autre colis 

À tout de suite répondit Pat 
Si tu m’as eu, je ne te raterais pas! Fils…!

Deux silhouettes s’évaporent dans le brouillard
Un réverbère et son reflet sur le boulevard 

Enfin s’en va le vrai félin
Qui a mérité ce qu’il avait eu 
Pat le chasseur 
Avait rempli le chargeur
Yuri a joué, et il s’est tiré dessus",La Roulette Russe
Oxmo Puccino,"Tu sais lorsque les gens disent que ton destin est écrit quand t’es petit,
Ils oublient que le stylo c’est le coin où t’as grandi.
Alors il s’est retrouvé dans la rue un matin d’hiver 
Avec les meubles sa sœur et sa mère.
Des histoires comme ça ici y'en a des tas
Lui resta sur le bitume, il fit carrière. 
Gravit les échelons sans brûler aucune étape,
Trafic, prison, jusqu’aux affaires d’état.
Aujourd'hui c’est jeudi, il veut l’acheter ce bar, changer de statut, se barrer d’ici.
Depuis peu vacciné contre le sushi 
Parce que, dans la vie, il aime ce qui croustille.
En pensant à sa traductrice, il met son plus beau slip.
En se demandant où trouver de grosses tulipes.
Parce que tu sais, tout le monde, 
Tout le monde pense à se ranger, à faire des gosses.
Alors Tito se laisse glisser en ville dans son beau carrosse

Tito répondait qu’une fois sur dix
D’après lui c'est le raccourci dans les tragédies
Répondre à cet appel est mauvais signe
Le numéro c'est Barbie qui sans prévenir
« Allô Tito si tu ne m’aides pas ma vie peut se perdre
On peut plus reculer, j’attends ça depuis deux semaines
Mon chauffeur est couché, tu conduis l’aller-retour
Tu me dois bien ça j’attends en bas des tours »

Sortir pour un rancard sexy se retrouver habillé en noir mais ash !…
Trois hommes silencieux vérifient les armes
Deux sortent, Barbie attrape une enveloppe
Puis la lâcha de sitôt, démarre si je rate la négos
Ce qu'il y a dans le coffre tu laisses à mes gosses
À peine une clope allumée, des coups de feu retentissent
Tito tire sur la vitre, s’élance atterrit sur une scène hallucinante
Au sol du sang Barbie immobile à ses pieds
Une enveloppe, des bruits de pas brisent le silence
Un inconnu s’arrête, son regard en dit long
Un chapeau qui cachait mal une tête de flic
Là ça se complique
Tito réfléchit vite
Tito vise, hésite, lui fait une fleur
Ramasse l’enveloppe, quitte le secteur
Pistolet planqué dans le paquet de chips
Avant d’aller chez le fleuriste faut brûler cette jeep
Un taxi pour ne pas manquer Habibi
Passer une bonne soirée et se faire un alibi",Tito

Oxmo Puccino,"Les jeunes du hall voient des guns, boivent des heinekens
ne restent qu'une semaine sur 7, sans fumer de shit
Relations familiales enferme dehors, on reste des nuits entières sous le porche
Le derche collé au mur 
prends forme plate
Même si le froid éclate nos neurones
C'est rien car rien c'est tout ce qu'on a

As tu vu comment tu nous mate conard ?
Parce que tu rentre du taf le soir, tu te crois mieux que nous conard ?
Timbré d'être posté la, même le jour de l'an glandant comme hier
Pendant que tu tises en te faisant croire que tu t'amuses
troubles existentiels on consomme des substances illicites pour toucher le ciel
Vu le que la terre s'écroulent sous nos pieds
Juste ciel, qu'est ce qui se passe 6ème étage du bat c
Les bouts de shit s'effritent comme la matière du marchand de sable
Squat les escaliers comme si il y avait des lits, pour coucher la peine ensommeillé dans la fumée
La lumière se rallume, s'éteint, se rallume

J’écris si vite et encore, que la feuille s'est consumée
Si une fois n'est pas coutume, qu'est ce qu'est mille fois
Couché dans des spots qui puent la pisse
Les rares filles qui passent ont la chaude pisse
Parler au futur n'est qu'une triste fausse piste
Selon ta fonction....
Comme dans les films, j'ai des potes qui se font filocher
Je te parle même pas de leur soeur, qui sont des filles aussi,
Des cibles amenées à niquer avec des mecs de la cité ou autres
C’est pour ça qu'on ne déleste pas les ninjas, on se teste qu'entre nous
Des noirs et des arabes se blessent au chlasse
Pourquoi le hall est si dur les courses poursuites ne foutent
plus la frousse, plus aucune poussé d'adrénaline
Malgré ma ligne, je peux te le prouver, ma conscience assez maligne 
Chanceuse évita le fossé

Les gens croient ce qu'ils voient comme si sa suffisait
ne savent que les jeunes du hall, utilisent des canons uzi, parlent de 
Lait avant douze ans
cajoline c'est pas pour eux, la lavande c'est la came, ils veulent la vendre.
Maintenant je suis un jeune des hall des maisons de disques
y efritte mon shit cool come clean, comme jeru nique ta race

Je t'insulte pour rien car c'est l'esprit
Célèbre mc, ghetto célé-brisé

Les jeunes du hall, n'ont plus peur de la mort ni de la taule,
elle est devenue leur pote, et tes torpeurs les font sourire
Ils ne soupirent plus, quand ils vont en taule ils y sont déjà dehors
Donc ils portent de l'or pour briller
Semblant de prier Dieu
Les a mis en galère, ils jurent mille fois par jour
Sur la vie de leur mère, mais heureusement maintenant.",Les Jeunes du Hall

J'vais devoir raccrocher ou me les coller au derche

Les voisins ont vu ta photo, chaud s’ils te reconnaissent,

La laguna grise, ne bouge plus de ton adresse

Ton blaze est sorti dans une sale affaire, que tu l'ai fait ou pas

Pour eux t'es coupable

Tant que ça chauffe l'atmosphère est peu potable,

Envoie ton frère chez l'avocat pas le tocard commis d'office

Casse ton portable, jette ta puce

Chaque appel piègeable,  reprends le bus

Les gamos tombent en panne pendant les courses poursuites

Y’a pas de hasard, ou d'arrestation gratuites

Tous les moutons sont des balances

Si t'es le berger, quitte la ville vite si on veut t'héberger

J'parle des pros, pas ceux qui taffent pour les gourmettes

Tu laisses pousser la barbe quelque fois tu mets des lunettes

La main sur le métal, sous la douche ou à la buvette

Ils ont relâché ta soeur et ton père

Comme dit le maire de Toulouse la cavale c'est une double peine

le temps va tous s'en va

Jamais déçu si tous s'en vont c'est comme ça

Les solitaires se connaissent soit ton pote grave

Avion, destination chuuut !! Avant ça

Récupère tes tunes, chez ses enfoirés

Qui t'aurais pas envoyé de mandat, claque ton bif en soirée

Ancien associé nouveau ennemis t'es au courant

Devant l'argent plus de Bible de Torah ni de Coran

Il demande pas d'excuse

Pendants les chefs d'accusation

Car seul le dieu le juge

Ces choix, que seuls les grands de ce monde comprennent

Tous, fils d'ouvrier voulant ce qu'il mérite

J’ose un hommage aux gangsters

Car avant les rappeurs, footballeur

C’était eux les références majeures

Avec le peu offert, pour prendre l'envergure

Le choix, pas si mauvais juste plus dur

Contre le système, en colère

Rien lui suffit, surtout pas taffer

Subir les collègues de merde

Viser le milliard c'est un état d'esprit

Atteindre l'objectif, malgré le risque pris

Les voyous sont sur piédestal

Sorti de prison, à chez Ardisson

A ta chute ou à sa perte les paris vont doubler
Etre une star à la sueur de son coeur, le corps marqué par l'absence de la peur
Il 's'agit pas de chats miolants, juste des poids lourds dans une danse violente:
Prix Pulitzer d'espression corporelle,
Une collision de bull-dozer,
Triple accident de chars d'assaut;
Car il va falloir... Que tombe l'un de ces deux garçons, ce soir...

[Refrain]x2
L'un de nous deux doit tomber en public;
Depuis, ton visage sur mes mirroirs
Couches-toi vite, j'ai une histoire à fonder,
Cela implique que ce soir...

Les vrais fous se font pas interner.
Ils rêvent les yeux ouverts, poings fermés
D't'façon, il n'y a pas de sous-métiers, encore moins celui de Champion du Monde entier.
Tellement ne save pas, hein, quand t'es seul sur le ring
J'en ai vu dans ce cas, leur jeans sentaient l'urine.
La vie est ironique: s'échapper des ruelles pour vivre de duels.
A la fin, y'aura qu'un type à l'horizontal, le respect mutuel, mais ce soir...

[Refrain]x2

Tête haute, le corps aéroporté dans la bulle que forme la corde à sauter,
Instinct de survie prononcer, c'est le combat de l'épuisement contre la volonté.
C'est de là qu'elle partie, l'action: une science dont vous n'avez pas la notion.
Courir des milliers de kilomètres, se nourir par la force et finir honnête.
Mais l'ange douceur, le son du cuir qui cogne, il n'est pas naît d'une cité mais d'une cygogne.
Hélas... Ce soir... Hélas... Ce soir...

Oxmo Puccino,"Le bruit de la pluie sur le bitume, en panne d'essuie-glace 
Mon pare-brise pleure, mon humeur durcit la glace 
Ceux qui disent que ""le temps c'est de l'argent"" sont dans l'erreur, 
Si tu mets les euros de côté, pas les heures 
Je commande un café avant le texte pondu 
Demande mon dû, car j'ai posé avant que le sucre ait fondu 
Souvent on avance, le temps m'importe mon pote! 
Si tu ne peux être à l'heure faut que tu te téléportes 
Quand on se rate, y a pas de prochainement 
La vie est courte, et la mort a tout le temps, 
Né le matin, majeur à midi, vieux dès vingt heures 
L'histoire oublie les héros mais pas les vainqueurs 

365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à manquer tu l'espionnes 
365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à compter tu te questionnes 

La vérité dépend de celui qui écoute, 
Et peu importe ce qu'on dit le temps révèle tout, 
Le temps fait du bien à l'amour 
Contrairement à ce qu'on pense, 
Les regrets c'est quand on se goure concrètement 
Le mauvais temps n'est pas le froid ou le gris 
C'est ce qu'on s'était juré, qu'à force, on oublie, 
Quand j'arrive pas à écrire
Le mauvais temps, celui qui te ronge,
La migraine quand tu t'interroges. 
Les rêves s'éloignent tu cours à leur poursuite
En vieillissant de moins en moins de plumes pour suivre, 
La durée de ma chanson est décroissante, 
Désolé je ne sais compter que jusqu'à soixante. 

365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à manquer tu l'espionnes 
365 jours puis 700, le temps commence à compter tu te questionnes 

Vivre c'est des chiffres et des lettres des chutes et des litres 
Des chèques et des contrats, tout ce que tu pourras 
Et lorsque tu pourras plus, tout va ralentir 
Signe l'avenir devient repentir.
À chaque marche passée, l'escalier s'effondre 
Alors je saute en chantant sur chaque seconde 
La vie est un beau train avec de sales wagons. La chance vagabonde, 
J’attends pas qu'on m'approuve j'suis un grand de ce monde 
Compose avec la lumière en tant qu'homme de l'ombre

Oxmo Puccino,"Ce qui m'a sauvé c'est que je ne voulais pas faire de peine à mon père,
Qu'il dise ce gosse? non, je ne l'ai pas fait
J’ai trouvé ma voix le jour où j'ai pensé à tuer un homme
Donc j'suis bien placé pour parler de paix. J’évite de me répéter,
Alors je me tais lorsqu'il est trop tard pour bien faire
Comment apprécier la paix sans la guerre
Comme la fin et le début les deux font la paire
Je viens déclarer la paix, sans heurts
Quelques cartouches d'encre dans le chargeur.
C’est l’arme de paix

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Cette audace de parler de paix, pendant la fin des temps
Chanter contre ce futur sans précédent
Il le faut ce monde c'est le nôtre
Je pense qu'on tire bénéf du bien de l'autre inquiet car, au fond, je sais
Le malheur de l'un ne fait le bonheur de personne comprenez guérir est la seule porte
On ne peut que périr sous la loi du plus fort
La patience est plus efficace que la force 
Raison pour laquelle je ne milite pas
Qui insulte la paix ne la mérite pas
Chacun touchera sa part de l'héritage

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
And make it through the days
I'm in my corner store

Je cherche l'impossible équilibre 
Sans en tuer dix pour que mille vivent
La paix à tout prix n'est plus la paix,
Je prends la peine d'un dernier appel
Les chanteurs de vérité sont des cracheurs de flammes
Sous feux des tirs d'armistice,
Je deviens un passeur de calme.
Un jour, l'injustice en personne
Fera tomber une larme

I guess I'm in the race
I'm tryin to win the chase
I'm trying to find my place 
and make it through the days

Aucun pour me compléter

Puis tu t'es préférée seule au fond de ton panier plutôt que mal accompagnée 
Tu ne connaissais pas ce genre d'homme qui reste après t'avoir contemplé 
À perdre dans tous les sens, tu n'attendais plus 
Puis nous avons fait connaissance, 
Tu ne me connaissais pas 

J’te connaissais pas comme tant d'autres, j'étais assuré 
Qu'aucune ne m'aurait dans la durée

Que la rage arrive par la vaisselle sale 
Je ne tomberai peut-être plus amoureux 
Mais dans le coeur, la clé des hommes heureux

A force de parler, on se contredis.
Quand on aide avec maladresse,
on peut faire du mal à ceux qu'on aime.
Remplacer un souci par un problème,
tu voulais bien faire mais ce fût le contraire.
L'art et la manière, trop peu d'artistes,
le manque de tact nous traumatise.
Ceux qui doutent se font du tourment,
On ne croise pas la fortune en la contournant.
Rien ne me surprend,
ni ta mauvaise foi,
ni ta joie ne font mon désespoir.

crient au loup devant des agneaux.
Pensais-tu qu'la vie s'rait joyeuse ?
Sans la creuser jusqu'au noyau...

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

Une petite remise en question,
tu l'as pris comme une agression.
Quelle idée ? Envers et contre nous,
notre vie passera malgré tout,
à se rappelle de ce qu'on avait,
insatisfaits de c'qu'on est.
Peu le reconnaissent,
les plaisirs mesquins, les calculs bas,
conduisent à la surprise du résultat.

J'ai tailler mon cur de cristal,
car l'amour ne suffit pas.
Des familles éparpillées,
seules mais tristes par milliers.

J'ai surmonter mes erreurs,
me tromper m'a rendu meilleur.
Si on ne veut plus se décevoir,
cessons les sens uniques dés ce soir.

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...
Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

La vie n'a pas de sens, j'ai fait le deuil,
l'impression de n'avancer que sur feuille.
Devant cette distance que l'on a creuser,
on essuie les yeux comme si il pleuvait.
Je n'écris pas pour qu'on m'adore,
ni pour que l'on soit tous d'accord.
A courir tous dans le même sens,
il n'y aura qu'une conséquence.
Aussi tragique soit la destinée,
j'veux croire qu'on peut la dessiner.
Certain que les bons chemins se croisent,
les amitiés forment les branches d'une étoile.

Quils viennent vivre à mille au mètre carré

Le printemps nous transforme en sauvages
Au premier rayon on plonge sans plage
On attend lété pour sentasser chez les autres

Coincés dans dhorribles jeans

Ceux qui ont le budget, ils taillent à pat pat, 
Champagne à quatre pattes locations de 4x4. 
Les moins fortunés restent aux bois de Vincennes 
Les petites camionnettes pour 2000 cents, 
Mais ça manque d'exotisme, tu peux croiser le voisin, 
Alors 400 kilomètres, ça ne mange pas de vin

Hélas en dessous de mes capacités, 
Les plans qu'ils avaient pour nous je les ai déjoués 
Taffer nous fait chier au risque d'échouer 
De toute façon, on ne va pas se plaindre 
Nos parents se sont saignés: 
Au sommet, on sera pas plein
Car on se fout d'être conseillé 
Mon daron m'avait dit qu'exister c'est 

Tirer des traits vivre les sacrifices de si près 
Je sais à quoi tu songes en secret, 
À notre âge déjà les traits tirés 
À force de tirer des traits 

En vrai, les femmes n'aiment vraiment que leurs enfants, 
Moins tu le comprends…plus tu te morfonds. 
Tous nés pour morfler!
Mes nuits blanches ... d'un divorce de Morphée 
Une vie montagneuse, des virages, des pics 
Des chutes et des mirages ! 
Radeau cassé, on repart à la nage du rivage 
Garçon, en une décennie, j'en ai vu défiler 
Trop de frères sont difficiles, à tirer 
Je t’aurais prêté la jambe, même estropiée 
Je t’ai donné la main, tu l'as escroquée 
Atteindre l'âge des blessures sans coquards, 
Transmission de savoir, se vider 
Pour que d'autres puissent avoir, 
Pouvoir pardonner j'ai tout donné, 
Mais les gens ne savent pas recevoir

Tirer des traits vivre les sacrifices de si près 
Je sais à quoi tu songes en secret, 
À notre âge déjà les traits tirés 
À force de tirer des traits 

5 disques, de traits tirés un million 
Autant de larmes tracées entre les lignes 
Mon métier les textes durs mais polis 
C'est la réponse lors des contrôles de police 
Elles viennent de l'univers, 
Mes phrases misent bout à bout font le tour de la terre, 
Les traits c'est comme les cartes, 
Le pire est de tirer les mauvaises 
Que tu le souhaites ou pas, tu vas... tirer un trait 
Tirer deux traits ça fait… très mal mais 
La vie c'est ... 

Tirer des traits vivre les sacrifices de si près 
Je sais à quoi tu songes en secret, 
À notre âge déjà les traits tirés 
À force de tirer des traits",Tirer des Traits
Oxmo Puccino,"Comment tu veux quon face pour choisir entre lady et bey bey
Les une aiment les fleurs les autres le fleuriste
Les une assument les autres bluffs et pleurnichent disent jsuis pas ta boniche ce casse pas longle aiment largent pas les gens riches
Les une viennent presque a lheure les autres de blair witch
Les une invitées à diner les autres en sandwich
Tu mesure mal tu t trompé
Ta jeté lune a leau et promis la lune a lautre
Les une ont tord les autres nont pas raison
Lessentiel c dêtre bien dans sa maison
Les une aiment ma plume les autres casse les burnes
Les une tont a lil les autres à lusure
Hé ! Tu nauras pas la brune de la pub car on fréquente les autres pour en apprécié une !
Même lune après lautre

Quand c jolie comme sa
Mets-toi à notre place

Si les une sont bonnes c grâce aux autres
Elles sont beau être bonnes elles sont rien sans les autres
Lune en a sous les bigoudis lautre dans le soutif
Les une nous marquent les autres ont les oublis
Les autres collections les une taime comme tu es tapporte des corrections
Les autres veulent tapprivoiser et lune passe
Résultat tu as pris la voisine
Les une ont les présentent a nos mères parce que les autres c pas la peine elles en veulent a nos nerfs
Les une sont presque les autres a cotés
Les une sont cotés les autres sont suspectes
Ten a aimé aucune des deux t loin de mes opinions
Les une discutent les autres se crêpent le chinions
Car sur un bateaux ya pas 10 capitaines
Les un les autres se mêlent avec elle
Envers son prochain lhomme est un félin
A qui la faute si personne nest fait lun pour lautre
Est-ce les une ou les autres,

Oxmo Puccino,"Tu sauras jamais à quoi je pense, 
T'as pas encore décidé je suis déjà aux conséquences. 
Ma tête dans la molécule harmonique, j'écris lorsque les mots s'y percutent. Infini est mon aperçu, étrange mélange de douceur, quelque chose d'herculesque, 
Ox du prestige au burlesque, je gère avec ce que la vie me suggère. 
Si tu ne pleures pas depuis hier, c'est qu'on ne vit qu'à travers les proches et leurs prières. 
Si je me presse pour créer ce poème, aurais-je le temps d'en faire un deuxième?

Véridique

J'ai la potion le plan, mais ta notion du temps n'est pas assez importante, rien que tu te plains rien ne te plait. 
Un pote qui s'en fout quand tu t'inquiètes? 
Est ce ton pote? j'en doute: pense à ton assiette. 
Triste verdict, deux milles ans sont passés, tout pour le capital, 
De plus en plus riche et c'est le règne animal 
Maudite intelligence que l'on manie mal 
Malédiction.

Véridique 

T'as plus rien à donner, tant que t'as pas pardonné, 
Je gamberge debout sur mon balcon, je me fous de ton balconnet, 
Les souvenirs une enclume, plus d'encre dans le bâtonnet plume, 
Le regard brumeux vise prudemment, 
Souffrir, percer le secret de l'endurance. 
Laisse-moi kiffer ce pochon de weed, 
On a des potes qui ont pris perpétuité. 
Si la peine est une épée, prends cette parole comme un étui. 
C’est véridique",Véridique
Oxmo Puccino,"Ha ha ha ha
Bien fait a la fête
Enfoirés

Nous naissons tous fous avec une vie pour guérir
Tant qu'une belle vérité reste à conquérir
Trouver l'idée qui marche deux cent ans
L’impression de le faire en plaisantant
Accueillis comme des clowns pas drôles
A la profonde parole des puits de pétrole
Avant que la fortune soit subite
Tous les génies étaient stupides
Couver le feu dans la glace qu'on s'y réunisse;
Des fois; excusez nous la réussite
Ceux qui n’aiment pas n’ont qu’à le faire d’abord
Allez mettre plus de dix personnes d’accord

Artiste c'est pas difficile
On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Pour trouver ce truc qui nous la rend si belle

Artiste c'est pas difficile

Il faut plus que des qualités
Pour modestement changer l'Humanité
Devenir la première personne des singuliers
Se passe rarement de façon régulière
Et de l’œuvre, comment chiffrer la valeur
Lors qu’à table le succès devient l'avaleur?
Le suspense des prochains loyers
Peut causer des problème de loyauté
Artiste être droit dans ses bottes
Être des trois sur dix milles, et garder ses potes
Pouvoir rebondir en abondance
En gardant votre sourire et puis tant qu’on danse

On essaie de faire un pull avec dix ficelles
Tu peins des chansons à la décibel
Trouver cette chose qui nous la rend si belle

Exister grâce à quelques fans
Pas de milliers d’amis ni de centaines de femmes
Une vie de famille acrobatique
Artiste, c'est pour ça qu'elle t'aime et puis te quitte
La peur d'être archivé parce qu’on fait moins bien
Appartenir au passé d'un succès lointain
Y mettre toute son âme et si c'est nul
Comprenez que les critiques soient malvenues
Le temps guette, les nouveaux arrivent
Tant de poissons vont s’y ronger la griffe

Oxmo Puccino,"J'ai grandi sur une île sans mer, aux vagues sèches et grises
Sur les hauteurs, je flottais en visant les autres rives
Des globules métissés circulent dans les artères bouchées
Du cannibale, aux mille pattes métallique roulant dans ses bouches
Qui à l'aube crachent des gens qui baillent, et les mangent aux heures de pointe
Les titis n'ont pas le temps de leur ville, les passants viennent de loin
Nous, dès qu'on veut profiter d'elle un peu la vie se complique
Courir sans la forme olympique, vous trace le regard oblique
À force de pression constante, la tension va s'estomper
Par imprudence des gens qui s'aiment, sans gare, se laissent tomber
Je démontre un escargot à la coquille dure à pénétrer
Mais le monstre est beau, à chaque retour, vous reconnaîtrez

Une créature de bitume, sa voix ferrée te crie dessus
Chuchote au marteau piqueur, les petits coeurs sont des fissures
Le temps se divise par quatre dans son oesophage
C'est lui la bête mais c'est nous qui sommes en cage
Sans changer de taille il grossit au risque
De serrer sa ceinture jusqu'à déchirer le périphérique
À part sur l'avenue tu feras pas dix mètres sans toucher le mur
Ou, sans qu'on te bouscule face aux fourmis, tu te sens ridicule
Après tout, que serait Batman sans Gotham ?
Quand le monstre s'assombrit, que les sourires diminuent
C'est à cause des gratte-ciels que les nuages éternuent
Alors l'orage gronde et la foudre précède un...

Même dans ses rares passages, le soleil sait se faire beau
La chaleur accueillie, telle un joli fardeau
Magistrale au mois de mai, la joie devient capitale
À demi nues sur les terrasses, les fraîcheurs sont admirables
Les quais sont florissants, inondés de coulées vertes
Chaque rencontre se change en amicale découverte
Agrippés aux ailes des bateaux mouches
Dans les parcs on pique-nique en chantant

À côté Lille, Lyon d'amitié

Ce monde est dur, on le savait, de quoi te plains-tu?
La peur de l'inconnu, j'trouve ça dingue
À cheval sur deux cultures, c'est au moins être bilingue

Bon, quand on aime quelqu'un on ne lui reproche pas

Comme un smartphone qui ne raccroche pas
Ou pire, une chauve-souris qui ne s'accroche pas
Des chants on passe au chantage affectif
Ça devient politique, effectivement

Ne pas avoir misé sur la bonne personne
Perdre la chemise à la mauvaise somme

Chaque décision définitive

Oysterband,"In the middle of the journey, in the middle of the day 
I came to a city and I stopped to ask the way 
What does it matter? Said the people with a sneer 
You can't get there from here 

You may be a gallant runner, you may hobble with the lame 
There are forty crooked hedgerows and they all look just the same 
Traveling gets weary, you get funny in the head 
Stop right here instead 

Well, says I, I was only passing through 
I'd like to stop and rest a while, it's true 
Then I asked them for a job to do 
They gave me life insurance and a straw to chew 

Welcome to the flatlands 
All the maps agree 
Far as the eye can see 
It's level, dead level 
Flatlands: life meanders by 
Chew a straw and watch the grass grow high 

And it's stand we stand together, fall you fall alone 
Authority's a leash of love to bring you safely home 
Fools look out for trouble where foreign breezes blow 
Tell your children so 

They've got to keep things ticking, they must never go on strike 
They'll be standing there till Doomsday with their fingers in the dyke 
There's faith and hope and patience and patience is the best 
Turn your face from the rest 

Well, says I, I'm much obliged to you 
Everywhere I go I'm learning something new 
If I understand your point of view 
You don't believe we're dying our whole life through 

Welcome to the flatlands... 

And if they waste nothing they can keep their little pile 
And if they say nothing they will not be on file 
And if they see nothing no one will see them 
No one will take down their name 

And if they do not panic the pain will vanish soon 
And if they never sing they'll never be out of tune 
And if they are faithful they will get their reward 
And if they are meek they will be spared 

Well, says I, I was only passing through 
I'd better get a move on 'cause the days are few 
Poppies are red, cornflowers blue 
The scythe is sharp the mowing's due

Was it something worse, does anybody know?

Did she pass them by, did she dare to meet their eye? 
Did she scorn them all and did they understand? 

A grief to her father -did she really leave him? 
a lover to her brother -yes we all believe him 
temptation to her betters -no better than she should be 
unfaithful to her lover -he always new she would be

No I never had a chance to prove them wrong

Did he go to ground, was the suitcase ever found? 
Did the police come swarming round on a trail already cold? 
Did he lead them a dance, did he run away to France? 
Or did he shop himself before the day was old? 

O she was bound to loose if she set her face to choose 
They never could excuse her for stirring up their fears 
She was much to young, the earth has stopped her tongue 
You can hear the voices calling down the years

What we wanted was 8 miles high
What we wanted was free fall
And our turn to fly

What we wanted was more fireworks
Everlasting 4th of July
What we wanted was more stars
In a bluer sky

All we wanted was something worth it
Worth the labor, worth the wait
Then they take you up to the mountain
You see too late

In the middle of a good time
Truth gave me her icy kiss
Look around, you must be joking
All that way, all that for this

What we wanted was consolation
The band of strangers, help for pain
What we wanted was to be sure
No friends were lost in vain

What we wanted was aggravation
A good cause and a bigger row
What we wanted was the whole plantation
Now, now, now

What we wanted was rhyme and reason
What we wanted was another way
What we get is a tin-pot heaven
And we're too drunk to pray

What we get is the old machinery
Grinding on in the same old way
What we need is the sweet republic

it whistles through his soul 
the solitary copper 
hopes that God is on patrol

they are waving us a long long goodbye 
thousands of lightyears... goodbye

Oysterband,"I was a miner, I was a docker 
I was a railwayman between the wars 
I raised a family in time of austerity 
With sweat at the foundry, between the wars 
I paid the union and as times got harder 
I looked to the government to help the working man 
They brought prosperity, down at the armoury 
We're arming for peace, my boys, between the wars 

I kept the faith and I kept voting, 
Not for the iron fist, but for the helping hand 
Theirs is a land with a wall around it 
And mine is a faith in my fellow man 
Theirs is a land of hope and glory 
Mine is the green field and the factory floor 
Theirs are the skies all dark with bombers 
Mine is the peace we knew between the wars 

Call up the craftsmen, bring me a draughtsman 
Build me a path from cradle to grave 
And I'll give my consent to any government 
That does not deny a man a living wage 
Go find the young men, never to fight again 
Call up the banners from the days gone by 
Sweet moderation, the heart of this nation, 
Desert us not, we are between the wars

But as they slowly tried it through 
The hands remembered what they had to do

And wept, and wrote upon the wall; 

Work like you were

To dig a channel for the human heart

Unless you weed it day or night 
Don't leave your life a lifelong long vacation

Keeping us in pace
With all that has a cool way
Of handling our age in every way

Knowing that this feeling will never change
Knowing that this feeling will never change
It's changing me, cool tide

This seaside is our home , babe
A shelter from a world
That's harboring a rough trade
Of martyrs and of girls in every way

Knowing that this feeling will never change
Knowing that this feeling will never change
It's changing me, cool tide

Children's stories, little worries
You bring home from work
To spend the night with all but hurry
We take time to love in a better way

Goes a story, talk from the village
All's been said and done
Wanting more than grace and glory
Is shooting at the sun

Ozark Mountain Daredevils,"Just about a hundred years or so ago
Ten men rode their way down the mighty colorado
And as I read about their journey
I couldn't help but feel a very similar yearning
To mr. powell
 
And I wish that I could have been there with him
The way he talked about the river I could tell
The revelations he must have felt within himself
The realization of what a man's supposed to do, I feel it too
(FLUTE SOLO)
 
As they would ride over the waves
As they would glide over the waves
 
The river forged its way through the canyons
That were so high that the clouds would float within them
Cascade fountains moss surrounded
On through a gorge grand beyond description
The river rolls
 
And like a whirlpool it sets my mind to spinnin'
Can you imagine walls that went so high
The sky would be nothing more than a single thin blue line
And rocks would rainbow their way up to the sky
 
As they would ride over the waves
As they would glide over the waves
You'd hear them singing, singing
 
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh,

Under the moon's pale light
Away from home and all alone

But little they know, that it's so hard to find

Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times

lately I've felt a little crazy
like I do when that moon's gettin' full
is there a change in the air or the way that I care
how can I explain how I feel
 
wish I knew me better
and I would if I half-tried
 
but my will is strong and it just carries me on
following the way that I feel
no my love ain't dead it just got to my head
and I need a little space to feel free
(GUITAR SOLO)
 
lately, I've gone a lot of places
and seen a lot of things I didn't need to see
maybe I followed a star a little bit too far
and lost something along the way
 
or maybe I needed to lose
something I shouldn't have had
but it feels so good to take a second look

no my love ain't dead it just got to my head

like to go where I want, when I can

In the streetlight while I'm walking

I hear voices, someone talking

When I listen, no affection

Something missing, no direction



Ooooh... Every moment

We have wasted, there is nothing

Ooooh... In the distance

Through the wreckage, I hear something

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home



On the way home through the raindrops

Up the stairway, to the rooftop

There's a silence getting louder

It's just another day without her



Ooooh... I'm a stranger

Under neon, never knowing

Ooooh... In the distance

There's a river, and it's flowing

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home

In the firelight, by the fountain

In the desert, on the mountain

There's a lost one, someone reach him

There's a last one, someone teach him

Oh... Love is calling

Oh... Love is calling me home

Through raw metals, slick women, cars and sedans

Knowing it'll be, I put it in the air
And stare at the emotions of those in the commotion
Hoping it's the chaos that we grow from
Opened a cold one, build with warriors that hold gun
For the same prize, our souls run

From they window, they see no sun
I say, ""Revolution, when he gon' come?""
Yes he came, in way that may seem strange
Only through chaos will we ever see strange

You are the word

You are the word

Check it out
The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only want to sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity
MCs are meant to be controllers of mics

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

Ese habla como yo
why habla muy lindo
why no es cierto lo que dice

Now the slick text in this here context
is just far too complex too far out to be fetched
So as I sketch check my patterns, my shades and tones
Freak in the microphone is yours truly saucer
The dope rhyme flosser
I got something for all you wankers and tossers..
With dollar budget pushing low grade quality
That's like ghost face sportin some no name walabees

Now I be damned if I sit on my ass
While these MCs tresspass cross my grass
Time to landscape
Reshape the garden for growth
Spread the message overseas, via remote

We got different types of flavas but they taste the same
All biters no writers in this hip-hop game
I blame myself plus you for things we do
It's not wonder why we stay under and don't bust through because..

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing

Ozomatli,"I heard her story from across the sea,
There was never one as fair, lovely as she.
With sun soaked skin and eyes of green, 
With all kindness and grace of a queen.
I set sail into a cold, dark sky. 
I had to see this beauty with my own eyes.
I crossed the ocean in a tiny ship 
With her image in my mind and her name on my lips. I set.

I found her standing upon the shore.
She was everything I dreamed of and so much more.
I felt a love that I've never known 
And I knew I had to make her my own.
She was light of the night. She was dark as the night. 
I fell under her spell, couldn't tell wrong from right.
I set.

She breathed new life inside of me. 
A whole new world she gave to me. 
Surrendered all she had to me, 
Even silver and gold. 
All she asked was my soul.

How could I've know I'd been hypnotized. 
There was more to my queen than first met the eye. 
She had a chain of lovers who died her slaves 
With a notion of blood for every drop that she gave. 

I never thought she could break my heart 
But all her contradictions are tearing me apart.
The secret she hides. 
The beauty she flaunts
She'll stop at nothing just to get what she wants.",(Who Discovered) America?

If we believe in our hearts

Than before everything in the store cost a quarter

Got ammo to bust back--my trusty pen
The winds are rushed, the men and women of lust
And how long do we got till it breaks just depends
On whether rims the same price as gems life
Right becomes wrong, wrong becomes right
We fight for life, with the breeze blows swift
Everyday I get bigger than boxed wrap for Christmas
Some say why do I spit my story?
Tell him he saw me alone with mics talkin' bout life
And you know just shootin' the breeze

Tell me love and hope never die. 
So raise your head up and stand up, no reason to cry.

And where we had it pathetic where citizens give up their civil liberties
To officers of evil intent & devilish tendencies
While enemies join forces to endorse this mental extortion gone corporate

When will the corporate forfeit morbid acts on the helpless?
Ignoring facts 'til they selfish aristocrats who flex well in the time where sex sells
Their crime rhymes melt kids' minds like soft snails
Either you end up in jail or caught shells

But time blinds, help kids find their thoughts well, for real
The media's how they get too attached
To violent images permanent like Yakuza tattoos
They got shoes, relax the underwear
While adult messages traumatize the younger ear

Whoâ??s to blame?
Whoâ??s the one who sparked the flame?
The victim who became part of the game?
We deal in murder for money, sex and fame.
The question remains the same: who's to blame?

Rich rappers when you talk it, I hope you keep your topics
As deep as your pockets and use logic
The words kill before you have time to breathe
What the ears hear & the eyes see, the mind believes

While they hang you from your ankle and they take what falls
Citizens of this planet deserve a wake-up call
He who hides knowledge controls this grand scheme
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

Whoâ??s to blame?
Whoâ??s the one who sparked the flame?
The victim who became part of the game?
We deal in murder for money, sex and fame.
The question remains the same: who's to blame?",Who's to Blame

There's a vibe in the city I've never felt before in my life.
Let's all rush and flow, make a big time aftershow party.
If we're gonna get it right got to hold each other tight tonight

And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby 
Oye Mami 
Donde Esta La After party

You offered a ride, a pleasant surprise
Your whip was on point but it couldn't outshine your eyes
Now I really know why we had to rush the flow darling
No we gotta get it right got to hold each other tight tonight

Now your obsessed with such a pace
But slow and steady wins the race

Slow down your moving way to fast
Slow down you know you'll never last
Slow down your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race

You seem to run around and round in vain
People are saying that you've gone insane
Tell me just what you're running from
One day you're here and the next you're gone

Slow down you're moving way to fast
Slow down you know you'll never last
Slow down your haste is making waste
Slow down and join the human race",Slow Down

I know it's gonna make you cry
But you belong to another my love
And half a love that just isn't enough

I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through

I've waited all this time for you
Believed your promises were true
I keep believing that you mean what you say
You'll leave tomorrow - now tomorrow's today

And I often sit and wonder why
You're not with me tonight
I stayed at home remaining true
While you were out with you know who

I am so tired
And I just can't wait around for you
I am so tried
And I always thought we would see it through",So Tired
Ozzy Osbourne,"Waiting for darkness
Doesn't anybody see

Deafened by silence
Doesn't anybody hear.
(I'm waiting darkness)
Playing with fire
But they're screaming
When they're burned
Out of the sunlight
Hasn't anybody learned
I know what they find
Is in their mind
Its what they want to see
Spare me from the light
Here comes the light
And here I'll stay
Waiting for darkness

Promise me rebirth
And then you tear me from the womb
Give me my freedom
And then you lock me in a tomb

I'm waiting for darkness
You gotta believe, you gotta believe its true
I'm waiting for darkness
I just can't concieve why darkness is overdue.

Is it friend or is it foe
Don't ask me questions
There are things you shouldn't know",Waiting for Darkness
Ozzy Osbourne,"How many times can you put me down
Till in your heart you realize
If you choose to criticize
You choose your enemies

Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong
In a sick society

You're no different to me
You're no different
No different to me

Look at yourself instead o' looking at me
With accusation in your eyes
Do you want me crucified
For my profanity

Concealing your crimes behind a
Grandeur of lies
Tell me where do I begin
If you think you're without sin
The first to cast the stone

Living my life in a way
That I choose
You say I should apologize
Is that envy in your eyes
Reflecting jealousy

Tell me the truth and I'll admit
To my guilt
If you'll try to understand
But is that blood that's on your hand
From your democracy",You're No Different

It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

I thought about the times when I turned my back & stalled

I thought I had it down for sure,
But time went by and I was lost in what I found

I turned around, I read the writing on the wall

Ozzy Osbourne,"Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long time
Stole many a man's soul and faith

I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Oh, pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted who killed the Kennedy?
After all it was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for the troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners are saints
Heads is tails just call me Lucifer
I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

What's my name?
What's my name?
What's my name?
I am Lucifer

Alright you motherfuckers
What's my name?
What's my name?
Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, come on baby

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

Ozzy Osbourne,"I met a magic man
Who had a daughter

But still I taught her

As lambs to slaughter

And I don't walk on water

A sweet temptation
She had me hypnotized
And still I'm waiting

As wet as oceans
With sand dunes bearing seeds

There I go with my whimsical ways again

Set up for money and greed
As if it isn't enough
We have to use it all up

How could you think nothing's wrong
You won't be smiling for long

Gone into the end, at my spend

Turn your head away, ignore the fear
Watching the ice crash down

How could you screw us all over

Got us the almighty dollar

Poison the air that we breathe
Change your industrial need
Destroy the soul that you steal, the radiation is real
Beat fate, too late, you built and fueled the fire

Deceived the whole human race

No thing like ever after

A flag draped over a coffin
Another soldier is dead

How many victims have fallen
How many more have to die
People dying in masses
Ain't gonna get any by

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of the homeland
Our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In between suicides

War, killing sons and daughters
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water
'Cause people gotta wait
Until the judgment comes

Politicians confuse me
I watch the body count rise
Why are the children all marching, Into the desert to die

The human psyche is twisted
The madness rising again
Another aim by a bully
I watch them dying in vain

We've got our marching orders
Defenders of the homeland; our pride
We've crossed through many borders
In between suicides

War, sends our sons to slaughter
Another failed attack, there is no turning back
Blood, running down like water

There's only one choice to be made
With thought restricted
And heart afflicted

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the whys
Will all be crystal clear

P!nk,"I've been a girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
I see the world
As a candy store

With a cigarette smile saying things you can't ignore
Like, mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you

Love or hate, fuck you, I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

I've been a girl with her finger in the air Unaffected by rumors the truth I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
Just find a new life style,reason to smile

Look for nirvana, under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex strings
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

Take what you get and get what you give
I said don't run from yourself,man, that's no way to live( no, no)
I've got a record in my bag,you should give it a spin
Put your hands in the air so that life can begin

(If God is a D.J, if God, say if God is a dj, if God...then life is a dance floor)
Get your ass on the dance floor now!

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it

If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
love is the rhythm,you are the music
If God is a D.J, life is a dance floor
you get what you're given it's all how you use it",God Is a DJ [Robbie Rivera Main Vocal Mix] [Robby Rivera Main Vocal Mix

Why was I the last to know that you
Weren't coming to my show you could of
Called me up to say ""good luck""
You could of called me back you stupid fuck
Why was I the last to know?

First date, we ate sushi and
It went well, I was funny and
You said I was a cutie
That's the last thing I heard from you
I left tickets at the door for you
I had to tell my mom that there was
No more room
You didn't show, that was so uncool
You could of called me back

So I guess this means that we're
Not friends anymore, I heard
It's me you're askin' for, I thought
I'd see you at the show
You said you'd go

[Chorus]

After the date, I wouldn't go 
Home with you
I wouldn't put my heels in the
Air for you
You tried to get me to do things
I just won't do
Last I heard from you
Here is how I guess the story goes
You would of came if I was a ho
Fuck for parts that's just not how
I roll, move it on down the road

So I guess, we, shouldn't be 
Friends anymore, sick of hearin'
That it's me you're askin' for
Cause I thought I'd see you at the
Show, you said you'd go!

You thought you had me
I think you didn't
You thought you knew me

How it's all turned to lies
Sometimes I think that it's better,
To never ask why

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame

But just because it burns, doesn't mean your gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns, doesn't mean your gonna die

Gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me

In the 6 double O, bumping Isley
He was getting kinda close, kinda touch-ay
Cause he had a little too much Hennessey 
He told me that he wanna go home, with me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""boo, I don't really know though""
He got closer to me, it started getting deep
He had me in a zone when he started to show me things
I never saw before

Hell-of-a cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick

In the 6 now, so hot
Gotta pull all the windows down
Eyes lead and I'm thinking bout the sheets now
Wondering should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines were kinda working
I felt my knees get weak, his body was calling me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets

Said, he was too schooled to be screaming my name

With a passion that turns into pain
And each I saw love walk out the door
I swore never get caught again

But ain't it true? It takes what it takes
And sometime we get too smart to late.

Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes

With a cigarette smile saying things you can't ignore

Love or hate, fuck you, I can see everything
Here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

Unaffected by rumors the truth I don't care
So open your mouth, stick out your tongue
Might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
Just find a new life style,reason to smile
Look for nirvana, under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex strings
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

What's the point of this armor, if it keeps the love away too
I'd rather bleed with cuts of love then live without any scars

Baby can I trust this or do all things end
I need to hear that you'd die for me again and again and again

Everything's rearranged, you came
And changed it and gave me a broken heart

You want to take the easy route

When times get hard you always walk away
You get mad and say you're leavin'
Why is it so hard for you to talk to me?
When it's so easy for you to walk away

So here I am, driving down the street
Lookin' for a sign, when will I meet
The man of my dreams?
When will he come to me?
When will he come to me?
I'm sick of trying, I'm goin' home back
To PA where I come from
And you can stay here and spend your
Whole life running, But baby I'm
Gonna move on
You don't want to work it out, no
You want to take the easy route

What will you do, now all your fears
Came true
You had my heart, you had my soul
You had it all- didn't you

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

P!nk,"Dear Mr. President I
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind?
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?",Dear Mr. President

Crack of sunlight
Crack in the mirror, on your lips
It's the moment of a sunset, Friday
When our conversations twist
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
But the ice should be on our heads
We only spun a web to catch ourselves
So we weren't left for death

And I was never looking for approval from anyone but you
And though this journey is over, I'll go back if you ask me to

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight

You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts
That others come, and others go, but you always come back
I'm a winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain
And just like the change of seasons
I know you'll be back again

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink of your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right beyond the cigarette and the devilish smile

I'm not dead just yet
I'm not dead, I'm just floating
Doesn't matter where I'm going
I'll find you
I'm not scared at all

I put it on my heartbreak

Something to remind you
The joy you'll never get this close again

I'm gonna charm you

Now it's him but it could've been you
Tell me why it's him when it should've been you
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change
Here's an image you won't forget
All your life I'll tease, I'll torment
I'll be gone as soon as you turn the page

Don't you wish you could hold
The angel in the centerfold
The fantasy you couldn't control
Who walked away from you

Don't you wish that you could hold
The pretty little paper doll

Who walked away from you

You're angry
I know this
The world couldn't care less
You're lonely

I feel this
And you wish you were the best
No teachers
Or guidance

And you always walk alone
You're crying
At night when
Nobody else is home

Come over here and let me hold your hand and hug you darling
I promise you that it won't always feel this bad
There are so many things I want to say to you
You're the girl I used to be
You little heartbroken thirteen year old me

You're laughing
But you're hiding
God I know that trick too well
You forget

That I've been you
And now I'm just the shell
I promise
I love you and

Everything will work out fine
Don't try to
Grow up yet
Oh just give it some time

The pain you feel is real you're not asleep but it's a nightmare
But you can wake up anytime
Oh don't lose your passion or the fighter that's inside of you

P!nk,"I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?
What about the way you say you love me all the time
Are you liftin' me up to heaven, just to drop me down the line?

There's a ring around my finger,
But will you change your mind?
And you tell me that I'm beautiful,
But that could be a lie

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leavin' here alive
I won't be leavin' here alive, no

Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife
'Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now
Watch it all play out, see if you really stick around

But there's always this one question
That keeps me up at night
Are you my greatest love
Or disappointment in my life?

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leavin' here alive
I might as well lay down and die

I'm holding on with both hands and both feet, oh
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me

Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker
This time around I won't survive
'Cause if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker

And everything is just a lie

Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people 
And you're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions
If we can speak honestly

What do you feel when you see 
All the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night
Before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?
And tell me why?

Dear Mr. President,
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say, no child is left behind?
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your Selves
When you pave the road to hell

What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
What kind of father might hate his own daugther if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way, from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?

Let me tell you about hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you about hard work
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you about hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you about hard work
Hard work, hard work, you don't know nothing about hard work
Hard work, hard work

How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

P!nk,"Drinking wine and thinking bliss, is on the other side of this
I just need a compass and a willing accomplice
All my doubts that fill my head, are skidding up and down again
Up and down and 'round again, down and up and 'round again.

Oh, I've had my chances and I've taken 'em all.
Just to end up right back here on the floor.
To end up right back here in on the floor.

Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.
But I'm not scared at all

The cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.

Sometimes you think everything is wrapped inside a diamond ring
Love just needs a witness and a little forgiveness
And a halo of patience and a less sporadic pace and
I'm learning to be brave in my beautiful mistakes.

Oh I've felt that fire and I, I've been burned
But I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned
I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned.

Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.
But I'm not scared at all

Of the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.

Irony, irony, this hate and love, hate and love
What it does to me, what it's done to me.
What is done, done

Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.
Broken mirrors and a black cat's cold stare,
Walk under ladders on my way to hell, I'll meet you there.

But I'm not scared at all, hmm,
No I'm not scared at all.
'Bout the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.",Crystal Ball
P!nk,"I dance around this empty house
Tear us down
Throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinning all around and now we fall

Pictures framing up the past
Your taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle
Now a rash

This used to be a fun house
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down

I'm gonna burn it down

Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fun

Echoes knocking on locked doors
All the laughter from above
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory

I've called the movers
Called the maids
We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble tumble house of cards

This used to be a fun house
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down

This used to be a fun house
But now it's full of evil clowns

I'm gonna burn it down

Oh, I'm crawling through the doggy door
My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place

P!nk,"Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?
Close your eyes and trust it, just trust it
Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air?
Have you ever looked fear in the face
And said I just don't care?

And it's only half past the point of no return
The tip of the iceberg
The sun before the burn
The thunder before the lightning
Breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?
You're whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

It's only half past the point of oblivion
The hourglass on the table
The walk before the run
The breath before the kiss
And the fear before the flames
Have you ever felt this way?

La la la la la la la la

There you are, sitting in the garden
Clutching my coffee,
Calling me sugar
You called me sugar

Have you ever wished for an endless night?
Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight
Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself
Will it ever get better than tonight?

When the spark has gone and the candles are out,
When the song is done and there's no more sound,
Whispers turn to yellin' and I'm thinking

How did we get so mean?
How do we just move on?
How do you feel in the morning
When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me,
Normally I'm so strong,
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before,
Knowing that forever won't be.

Always sentimental when, I think of how it was,
When love was sweet and new and we just, couldn't get enough,
The shower it reminds me you'd undress me with your eyes,
And now you never touch me and you tell me that you're tired.

You know I get so sad when it all goes bad,
And all you think about is all the fun you had,
And all those sorries ain't never gonna mean a thing, oh

Oh we said some things that we can never take back,
It's like a train wreck tryin' to hit the right track,
We opened up the wine and we just let it breathe,
But we should of drank it down while it was still sweet,
It all goes bad eventually.

Now do we stay together cause, we're scared to be alone?
We got so used to this abuse, it kind of feels like home

But all that effort I guess
It didn't add up to very much

It hurts me when you call
I hate the way your thinkin'
I could have so easily had it all
I could've had everything,

I could've had everything
This perfect life I'm in,
Screwin' myself over
I could've had everything

I should have had everything
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over
Screwin' myself over

They say that madness is
Doing a thing the same way
You hope it's gonna turn out different
But ya doing it anyway

I guess it's what I did with you
But at least I have a reason
So my apologies, wont go to anyone
It hurts me when you say,

That all my close mates hate me
I really thought I had it all
I could've had everything
I could've had everything

It's the perfect life for men,
Screwing myself over,
Screwing myself over
I could've had everything

I should've had everything
You almost got me thinking
I'm screwing myself over

I could a, I could a, I could a
I could a, I could a, I could a had everything
I could a, I could a, I could a
I could a, I could a had everything

I came so near to thinking
I had something
I could've had everything
It's the perfect life for men

Screwing myself over
Could've had everything
I should've had everything
You almost got me thinking

I'm screwing myself over
Could've had everything
I should've had everything

There was a 5.8 earthquake today
And it kinda got me thinking
I'd still have all my hate for you in tact
Even if I lost everything

What did I say
Why are you shaking your head
You know you done me wrong
I may be crazy it's all in my head
But I want you darling gone

Why did I ever like you
What did I see
Whatever it was must have been some kind of illusion
A Magic trick on me

Eh eh eh eh [repeats for a bit]

It's hard to believe I ever laughed at anything you said
Cos you're just not funny
Who would believe I'd let you do all those things
Oh I guess the joke was on me

I tried to be zane
I've even asked all my friends
To help my let it slide
But all I see is your face
In my favourite place

I hear the trash you're talking
In your sleep
The secrets that you're keeping
A chick, that's smart
Did you really think that you could keep her in the dark?

Does she purr?
Does she make it hard?
Hard to speak
Does she dress the part?
I'm sure she'll take some getting used to
Darlin', she won't ever be me

I felt the bite
Take a spit
Suck the poison out of me
I'll make you beg
Make you come
To your senses
If you keep up the shit
Take the hit
Dig the grave
This is how it goes down

Doesn't matter cause I'm over it now
This is how it goes down
This is how it goes down

I'm gonna rage
Stay out really late
I'm gonna hang with all my friends you hate
I may try that threesome
Better late than never and
Better without you

This is your future as I see it
You will be homeless, poor, and broken
She will have left you when she finds out who you are
You're nothing but an extra, and baby I'm the star

I suppose this is how the story goes, but
Ever since that door closed, I've been going down, down, down, down
The drain and the pain got me nauseous
I should have been more cautious or clever
Whatever, you'll never find a dude with a better head game, and
You can take that both ways
You laughin' like I'm playin' wit your fingers up like oh ?
Wish you would have a threesome without me I pull a O. G.

Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood

Pretty pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me!

You're so mean, when you talk, about yourself you were wrong
Change the voices in your head, make them like you instead
So complicated, look how big, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough! I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Oh, pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool and limed and we try, try, try
But we try too hard and its a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics 'cause there everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that, why do I do that?
Why do I do that?

Oh, pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me!
You're perfect, you're perfect

Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me",F**kin' Perfect
P!nk,"Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?
Close your eyes and trust it, just trust it
Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air?
Have you ever looked fear in the face
And said I just don't care?

And it's only half past the point of no return
The tip of the iceberg
The sun before the burn
The thunder before the lightning
Breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?
You're whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

The walk before the run
The breath before the kiss
And the fear before the flames

Clutching my coffee,
Calling me sugar

I hear your voice and I, I break in two and now there's

So I guess it's up to me to find the truth about love is it comes and it goes

A strange fascination with his lips on toes
Morning breath, bedroom eyes on a smiling face
Sheet marks, rug burn, and a sugar glaze
Shocking me all, they can eat your eyes
It's the truth about love

I think it just may be perfect
The only person of my dreams
I never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh, you want the truth?

The truth about love is it's nasty and salty
It's the regret in the morning, it's the smelling of armpits
It's wings, and songs
And trees, and birds
It's all the poetry that you ever heard
(Terra) crudités, lifeline forget-me-nots
It's the hunt and the kill
The schemes and the plots
The truth about love is it's blood and it's guts
Purebreds and mutts
Sandwiches without the crust
It takes your breathe, cuts and leaves a scar
But those untouched never got never got very far
It's rage and it's hate
And a sick twist of fate
And that's the truth about love
The truth about love

I think it just may be perfect
The only person of my dreams
I never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes

Oh you can lose your breath
Oh, you can shoot a gun and
Convinced you're the only one that's ever felt this way before
It hurts inside the hell we've been in
It falls to get a pocket-thin and
It's raised before the angels' lips and
It can turn you into a son of a bitch man

Just hours before you occupied my bed
In our darkness we conjured up sunlight
In our haste, our need, our thirst we lost our sight
But I was inspired tracing the lines on your face
To the poetry the first time I heard your name
When I trip from your lips my heart was like a kick-drum
And it silenced the guilt, I wasn't raised to hurt anyone

That I'm lyin' but I can't go, can't say no

Then I wouldn't be baskin'

Where is the beat? (oh, no)

So how do I justify to the judge and the jury
The voices in my head that caused this fury
Never had to play with matches to start a fire
But it got so cold and I thought I'd forgotten desire
I was your concubine and then your Madonna
You couldn't see anything behind your baby's mama
How long is lonely supposed to last?
I was naked and waiting for you to come back

But for fun, I shoot 22 from ya shoe to ya knees
I run a record label and a crew of Gs 
So, niggas'll come and look for you if I sneeze 
Or even breathe the wrong way 
You better do what the song say 
And Be Easy, else it'll be a long day 

[Chorus]
(I'm a king) Bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans 
(I'm a king) You pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams 
(I'm a king) Top topic of all of your magazines 
(I'm a king) Head of the body, leader of the team 
(I'm a king) Remember I can get your block knocked dawg 
(I'm a king) A Bentley coupe with the top chopped off 
(I'm a king) I'm connected nationwide, but in the south 
(I'm a king) Just expect ya to keep my name out cha mouth 
(I'm a king) 

[Lil' Scrappy]
I'm a grand hot shelf, the last player left 
Nigga wanna harden up, I'm the ruler of myself (self) 
Fresh when I walk, you got manure in your steps 
The less a nigga talk, the more a boss is impressed 
It's a mess when you flex, let's take away your belt 
Leave you stretched on the whips, take your head off your neck 
Shit I feel like Sha Po', I'll roll more or less (more or less) 
45s in my slets, I ride for the set 
You ain't live as a Tekk, assault rifle of a boy 
I treat 'em like pets, solid gold bullets 
I'll kill you with finesse (shh), this is not a test 
Desert Es at your request, it's poppin' all that shit, now what do you suggest? 

[T.I.]
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Laid out like a drunk on the late late, so haters hate 
The hell with all the haters say, from Wednesday to Tuesday

I'm down with the kings, some call me the greatest 
Number 1 hustler, I keep the street blazin' 
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins 
Why y'all cherry-pickin' hustlers out here slavin'? 
That cane shit nigga run deep in my veins 
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow mayne 
That's pimpin', my game is premium like octane 
Can't tell we knowin' bout stackin' these bitches man 

[T.I.] 
I'm the king of the dirty, superseded in the throne 
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome 
With a princess so demandin' and an aura so strong 
The south ain't been represented like this is so long 
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin' on my temper 
Or otherwise I'd cock some pistols send some missiles to your temple 
Disrespect us I'ma blick up to ya, get ya, plain and simple 
Brass knuckles to your dentals, blast suckers in their dimples

While she givin' head hangin' off the edge of the bed
Thought she had a milkshake when her bang pop out her head
Pussy fat like Bone Crusher plus the ho ain't ""Never Scared""

Freaky, freaky wild things constitute for wettest dreams
A white mask and black cape tryin' to make these bitches scream
She nasty as a Luke record, mouth is a cum drain
She goin' up and down on that jeezy do that damn thang
She don't want a damn thing she do it on the face
And she do it all day cause she really love the taste
It's a waste if you tryin' to keep that action to yo damn self

Do your boy a favor when you out don't kiss her man

Ain't nobody slipping, one of my boys got a weapon
I'm headed to the park, jeans swinging left to right
Feeling alright, keep my dogs all in sight

And it's barely the beginning

Drinking White Russians and Mintory Sours
Leaning like the tower, bent to the limit
Take another shot for the block, homey clear it
I hear it in the back, I hear it in the front

The rule of the game drink it all till it's hollow
Follow my lead, take it to the brain
Whether we're swigging or hitting Mary Jane
If you can't hang or maintain me and my gang
Under control and then we let the shots ring
If you claim to be a baller let it be known

Three hour dotter, get thirty minutes of visitation

Staring at the world through my mirror,

My bag lady will make Erica Body applaud
Ah, surround rap with this shiffer baby
Grand for grand, if you tryina ship for daily
You bitch, break it down, break it down for me
Go wild, we serve em hand to hand, hit the town for me

Where the leaders live in a house of a lie like Don Chito
That's now, and still see non believers
And I hear what's great of covers affair for dying divas, what?
What kind of celebrating do you like to do?
A right to passage or the flashing lights that's blinding you
Haters you, wanna bring you down cause you trying to
Have a good day like O’Shea back in ‘92
Giving myself a minus to, bounce like the beat I'm rhyming to
If I see you got the devil up inside of you
Name another rider who, will provide you with the truth
Or keep tighter than the bodies do
That's why they try to take him out like Chinese food
Cause of the special delivery, it’s a sign of the fertility, dead like shvelry
Is it over your head? The way you feeling it?

In the middle of the night
Bottom of the world
But the view ain’t that bad
From where I stand
‘Cause I can still see the stars
Behind the smog
And I ain’t giving up just yet on finding God

Excited of simple things like dimples in my girl’s back
She told me to hold her tightly but I’m wonderin where the world’s at
Stuck in the middle of nowhere, given a chance I wouldn’t turn back
I’d rather be broke than turning on people who had it when I was hurt bad
Some real shit
So I write like it was a key to unlock the holds inside of it there
Potential of what it could be
Fight to keep this life free as the stars
Because not even we could speak of what we could become
Given a week away from harm, let’s be sure that can start
A hungry writer from his heart turned into dark like his odds not even a spark
And when he heat up in this cold
Mess light up in this alone
This hole is the only thing I can hold on
2 nowadays as they begin to blur
My dreams are being more than I fiend begin to stir
From my need to be content inside of myself
To inspire inspite of my doubt

[Chorus]

Life only a dull reflection of death
So I ride, I need to make the best of what’s left
Living fast but none the less I’m dying slowly
And my heart just an engine and my mind is only just a spark plug
And I think I need a jumpstart
No matter where I turn I’m headed for the junkyard
Don’t want my time back
Who do I need to speak to
Bout everything I’ve been through for me to be who I am
Does anyone even know whether we die? Hello
You know that we never come back, right?
Ayo, anyone get the reply? Uh
Anyone livin their mind tellin me there’s a Messiah
Send some more than sky, huh?
Something I hope that you’re right
You really believe that, you really gon read that book literally
And then I need that, you never thought that maybe it could be history
Telling me that and then tell you I disagree
I’ll tell you the truth, it all just sounds like some bullshit to me

I… I’ll never believe in no god
But I believe in the skies
And when I die, I die

Where them years go? I’m M.O.P., Jim Brown
Setting the 21 edition, I just follow tradition
I remember when snitches got stitches
Nowadays those kids don’t care, they say them shits gonna hit ‘em
Too late, you get the clap and send that kick home square
That’s a lifetime cost and that shit don’t heal
And I’m not through the bullshit, my life style is in the city rules
Coincided with innocent and blues

She got me tempted to taste it like it’s gourmet
Honey drippin slow like that Ohio playa’s album cover
Or like some sorbet in the middle of summer heat
No shelter went underneath of that fountain from her
She love me and like her back
I swear we make a perfect match
Got my hand on the bible flat

It’s time to shake it for a player, it’s time to shake it for a player
It’s time to take the cool off and shake it for a playa

Uh, I make your screen a lil bigger
She send me videos, she used to send me pictures
I’m on the boat like a UPS deliver
But every I beast so I now I really know the different law
I’m on a roll right now
This one done got me on the road right now
I wrote a song as I was thinking bout you
So if you want it I’mma think about
Here we go, can you jump?
I think I made my point
You know you miss right now
But I’ve been tryin to make her rich right now

Crispy like Popeye's chicken, grease dripping
Your breed is flee-bitten, your queen is smitting
No schemes or smittings, slim pickings, but not for pimping
My guns got extensions on 'em, there's something falling
In the hotel snorring, she's from Florence
The feelings euphoric, I caught it, and laid a guy slaughtered
I'm looking towards the Forbes list, live lawless
Diplomatic plates on the corners
The deeds was tipped off by the informants
Light a big splif from the balcony, this is alchemy
I'm high, I'm out there where the falcon be
Posers like henny red, I spread the sweaters with the Indian head
Forever get branded, switch bags, different hoes, thick legs
Post it, missed the end, you gotta give me some credit
20 000 dollars bag, the med come for a hollow head's fed
Crack the wine, the feds tapped a line around lunch time
Arrive ducking one time, flying
With something young and hard, too tight, snide
Slide into king size, fingers like visa pops
The Louis key on the sneaker box, this hustle is shit
Feat shufflers heat, rain thunderous
Them niggas don't fit the criteria, let the interior peace
Keep it under us, tally up the revenue

Bumpin Outkast, let’s take em back to the past

As a fetus I had the genes of a genius
One of a kind, hand stitched like Nemetes
No leaders, pleading that God need us
Existent was non-existent, the Lord dreamed it
In the belly of it all, I just wanted to play ball
Blow like napalm, every nigga around had the vision of Ray Charles
My best friend was best friends with er and all
Getting ready for school, watching Cartoon Network
Mama said turn the TV off and get dressed first
Navy blue uniform, pants and dress shirt
6th grade, plotting how to triple my net worth
Life’s a bitch but they never did warn us
Early mornings, going to class, see my friends on the corners
Moralists, gold chains for ornaments
Watch niggas go from part 1 to the choralists

If you’ve seen what I’ve seen you’d know how I feel
And then you’d kiss the world, we lightin on the mill
Past old reminisce, going on top
Feet to the ground, your head to the sky

If I had a dollar and a dream in the winds I’ll fly away
Me against the world, only when the life came by today
Sometimes all day I’ve been forgot, getting away
I close my eyes and see myself so far away

Now they’re feeling the destiny’s in my ball court
In there playing with my team and we all for it
Rookie of the year, dominant sophomore
I’m just tryna improve myself, evolve more
Come into contact with women of all sorts
When it come to greatness I never fall short
Picture me flying down with you in a Panamera,
That’s a Panameric, counting bread like dinero
If I could, I wouldn’t sleep on my mama coach
Lake Falls, get a crib as big as Obama house
Quick to find a route, every girl tonight dialing out
Black car, no limit to my amount, yo
Wise beyond years, like I read poems
Life changed but my mom made me do songs
Never was ashamed, couldn’t tell me I never will be ‘cause I’m still me

We know how they not and how they arms is start to swellin here
Pain don't never mind is just a sign to what they sellin here,
Never fear, never scared, my city is one alone,
Couple clowns jumping on, fuck them heavy undertones
Never float like I was from nowhere else than I'll be from
Living proof of winning courtesy, or what my life be done
Bucket load, navy blue, bottom great, daily hue
Horses on my hoodies, know my walking where it put me,
Swear to God I know this city like the pockets and the breathe
And I know the clock ain’t in my reach
But I'm gonna get mine by any means,
I've been the poster for the city, since I intervened on Christmas Eve
Born to be the logo for so they born enemy
Showed yall what the hype about, believe it like religion
Pray to God you play the odd even though the evens in your visit,

My city on fire, don't need matches to start it neither
I mean sometimes it’s cool but most of time this shit is hectic
So hectic I can't even think that shit won’t blow a record
Police harassing us, the color of my skin offend em
Not every black hit on that corner, out here drug selling,
Yeah I'll be drug selling, I'm just one more felon
Doing me to survive, it’s hell into a better heaven
Everybody aiming for your melon,
Bedrooms turn in more bedrooms,
We facing voodoo headwinds, quitting I did not blood through,
Blotch out here, drown and hit me
Winslow when I heard the gun blow

Hustlers hustling into fiends, fiending
The subway beat you there, just make sure that you know where you're going
Get caught up in the drama, 'cause this forever flowing.

And for no reason at all 
I`ve got perma grin 
Sometime I feel like a starfish 

Feeding in the sand 
An angelfish swims nearby 
With a twist of its fin 
Sometime I dream I am a whale 

Swimmin` in the deep blue sea 
My mind goes to the strangest places 
How can this be 

I`m a dandelion seed 
Float, float, float away 

Sometimes I feel like a UFO 
Flyin` in the air 
Wondering if I`m ever gonna be accepted 
Down there 

Sometimes I fell like a snowflake 
Stacking up on my friends 
Feel the warmth of Mr. Sun 
And I`m back to the earth again 

On the wings of a butterfly 
I fly over the flowers 
Into the garden of your love 
Where we melt into the colors 

It`s funny how this beautiful garden 
Gives us what we need 
I like the smell of balsa wood 
I like the smell of weed 

Sometimes I fell like a steam train 
Barreling down the tracks

For my caboose to pass

Never touching the ground 
Everyone is riding me 
But it never weighs me down

I`m a teardrop rolling down your cheek 
Familiar with your sadness 
It`s enough to make me weep

I feel like an accident 
Right now I`m a boomerang 
Like karma I come back 

Like a guard growing dreams 
Or a farmer with forever corn 
I`m a filter for the ocean 
An alphabet you don`t have to learn 

I`m spring`s first flower 
In love`s first sigh

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

Every road has a turning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summerflowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her head

When I awake and see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms,
The ache is there so deep inside me

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her fingers so softly
And then my Mary wake to love and love again

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share,
We share together

Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me

That I'd sent another Southern boy to hell

And if that rebel soldier had a wife

Oh mama, oh mam, I'm so cold

Heard me playing and singing my songs

Sent me on my way down rainbow

Pushed me till I had to take his life

I had to wear a number before they ever heard my name

P.J. Proby,"In my neighborhood where folks don't live so good now.
The rooms are small most the building made of wood.
I hear the neighbors talking 'bout you and me.
Yes I've heard most every word 
'Cause the talkin's loud and the walls are much too thin.

She don't really love him. 
Oh that's what I heard them say. 
She sure wasn't thinking of him today.
I saw her in the courtyard say that girl in room one forty nine. 
Talking to a boy I've never seen before, 
And standing there together don't you know they looked so fine.

No I don't want to hear it anymore
I don't want to hear it anymore.

'Cause the talk just never ends and the heartache soon begins 
The talk is so loud and the walls, they're much too thin.

Lord ain't it sad, said the woman cross the hall,
That when a nice boy like that falls in love 
Hey it's just too bad that he had to go 
And fall for a girl that doesn't care for him at all.

No I don't wanna hear it anymore.
I don't wanna hear it anymore.
'Cause the talk just never ends and the heartache soon begins.
Oh they talk so loud and the walls are much too thin.
Oh I wish they wouldn't talk so loud and expose my heartache to the crowd.",I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore

P.J. Proby,"Today I killed a man I didn't know
I held my rifle high and shot him low
I'd like to think he really was to blame
Well I never knew or never will his name

I guess that someone, somewhere knew him well
And they'll cry when they're told that he has fell
But it's hard for me to think of him as good
'Cause he'd done me just the same if he could

Oh mother, oh mama, I'm so cold
And I feel like I am quickly growing old
So I hope you are thinking of your son
'Cause tomorrow morning I'll be twenty-one

Oh Johnny Ray, Johnny Ray, oh, he don't worry now
He don't wonder how

Today my sergeant told me I've done well
That I'd sent another Southern boy to hell
But I can't help wondering about the lost of life
And if that rebel soldier had a wife

Oh mama, oh mam, I'm so cold
And the good book doesn't help me like you told
'Cause it don't tell me if I'm right or wrong
Or when this war will end, just how long

See as far as I can remember I was po' and broke
No money in my pocket and no weed to smoke
But now thangs changed, see it's been a little better lately

Niggas blowin' they brains out, so vicious
Fake niggas, kickin' niggas doors down

For what?
Just to brag when some hoes around
And you call yourself a gangsta, a hustla, a playa? (huh)
That ain't nothing if The Lord ain't yo Savior

And everything I say be silent, so that's that

P.M. Dawn,"Yeah!

In a quest to become colorless
I exhault my eyes with a most profound trust
Yet they are masters at deception
I wonder why... a black 4 leaf clover
Prince be sends a purple valentine again

How does it feel to be some kind of beautiful? 

Once more my feelings have succeeded in confusing me
But whats most amusing is
I like the way it looks.

Distorted isn't it? 
But its beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!
Damn.

How does it feel to be some kind of beautiful? 

I drift along in a sea of compulsion
Whether or not I'm dead
I have no idea
I'm standing on a hill that overlooks a meadow
And I'm thinking

Of absolutely nothing
My current mood must resemble electric blue
Its always tranquil, but
It makes me bleed

Question marks constantly arrest my persona
Ironic how that creates one for me
Whatever is whatever

A phenomenon that consists of life and death
Hi Mr. Experience
How was your trip to the moon
I tear my thoughts with my own sarcastically piercing blade
I love you
Because you make me sick

Distorted isn't it? 
But its beautiful!
Exceptionally beautiful!",The Beautiful
P.M. Dawn,"Pas quand jetais une femme solitaire, jai puieppe.
Oh never mind me man
I'm just rhyming here
Its an old one that no one knows anyways
That's the way it goes
Kisses directions through my mind every time
Guess he likes to collect blue hickies
I dunno
I remain the same
Comatose anyways
Whatever

Ask me that question again
Who am I what am i
Look at my face the eyes don't lie
If I was with a smooth tongue
Used for fun
I'd take a look at myself
And ask myself why I got a thread
A thread that I'm holding on for sandy
My minds taking things that are going on
Close to the soul
And actually steppin' on
These people are doing wrong
The list can go on and on
For ages
Tangled up through mazes
As lost as a meal that's pushed to a panther
I keep my eyes on those who pass by
They look to pm dawn the quest for the answer
Mercy mercy me till I see
The end of the human race is Grand Prix
Mr red knows I pose a threat
Yea I'd like to see him sweat
Dr vibe tends to get hypnotic
Reality thinks the prince be is erotic
The magic wand seems to be misplaced
I can't see it if its covered in lace
The best way to keep your word is not to give it
I don't make promises cause promises die
But those who use hate just wont participate
So that's why I choose to use my eyes
And stay comatose

A positive and negative impression on your brain
Whatever remains whatever stays the same
Results from an inside view or perspective
Other than that persona snaps under strain
But what remains to be seen
Is how you chose to use your time
And still the point blank calculations unclear
Of whether your text can catch these lines
Or toss 'em to the side
So you can't realize
Illusion only lasts until the scene is through
Approachin' this scenario
What would you do
Lose your noodle
Or try some voodoo
Accept defeat then what's the next phase
Rely on the brave
Rely on the copious
The secret of any victory lies
In the organization of the non-obvious
In a comatose

So they tell me a lie
To keep my head straight
But view sets the fronts like an unseen crime
I like to watch a watcher close
And see what they might take
A tick from a tock
A line from a rhyme
A leaf off an elm
A move might yell bold
An unseen realm
Or what that realm holds
Is nothing.. nothing that makes sense
They walk with small talk
And I watch the consequence swell up
And overflow into a large brook
Maybe its the undertow of what the tide took
The put together scenes
Make it all seem clean
A pacified pictures the life-fiend dream
Till its tried by the spies that's when they realize
The rose ain't red and the violets ain't blue
But those that are swift will pin point the trip
And everyone else'll think its de ja vu
Except the comatose",Comatose
P.M. Dawn,"A question mark's on a question mark
And insecurities connect my parts
I thought you are me and I am you
So I talk to myself 'til my face turns blue
Ask me if my feet touch the ground
I drift away and explore the profound
A morph to satisfaction is the trip
It's you isn't it?
Father tell me what you think of me
Please, tell me what you think of me
The pressure and the weight comes in with the tide
I tell you that I love you a thousand times
Someone said a silver course lands my door
Now question marks talk to me even more
I'm tired.. and I wanna come home
But all that pains me is the thought of my own
The thought of you just reeks with divinity
A spark by my heart is the symbol of the trinity
I can understand that the stakes are high
But I'd really like to know what I've done and why
I'm floating in a sea of doubt when it comes to that
It seems as though all of my thoughts are now acrobats
I am you, now that's a thought to renege
But in the thought that stops it seems to get big
I wonder why father why it is what it is
Because I am what I am? What gives?
Alphabet soup brings uncertain T's
A kiss on the cheek is more trouble for me
Is it possible that I might decompose
And reassemble with a spark and a rose
I notice that oblivion follows me around
As ode to forgetful mind is shot down
Eternity is holding a Rubix cube
And everything inside it seems to be nude
I just don't get it sometimes it's weird
It barely shakes but escalates into fear
I'm so distraught that it now makes sense
The perfect pony.. but you'll only get a glimpse
Now someone tried to hit it with a stick of bamboo
I wonder wonder wonder wonder who
I grin as the era of the selfish fades
And I'm looking at the skies through a pair of dark shades
And I'm buggin' I guess cause it makes me feel good
There's so many things that I misunderstood
I guess I'll never know.. it'd probably cut me like a knife
I swore I spent my life trying to be Christ-like
But I love you father so I can't lie
I think I'll still be scared even after I die",Even After I Die
P.M. Dawn,"If I wuz you

So surreal so surreal
So surreal that it can't be real
I'm just so afraid of banana peels
A wandering eye does not have sex appeal
I'm 99 and a half light years away
And they expect me to be okay
They see me in some other light
But who told them that I wasn't alright?
Get with it said the prince to the be
Doncha realize that they can't see
That's cool I'm in a tranquil state
But I can't see why they don't calculate

If only ya had my eyes to look through
Mellowin out is what ya need to do

Mirror mirror what'cha got for me?
Since I'm you and you're just so me
I know they've lost themselves instead
I know that destiny's face is red
I can see my rainbow's real sweet
But for that quick quiz I gotta crib sheet
So what's the matter you? why do ya look sad?
Man this world doesn't look so bad
What's the deal with the heal of a shoe
Why's an ankle such a red kangaroo
It all depends on the way I think
A watcher's point of view don'tcha think
There'd be a time where I wouldn't have a clue
But only if I wuz you

If I wuz you

Poor, poor aristocrat
Shaken down by a pussycat
Thought he was a strong believer in the now
He thought he was up so he got shook down
Deja vu, even I myself
That's why educated guesses I think might help
But a flat out reading, I don't see how
And things we gotta deal with right now
Like the fact that my complexion may offend you
Environment's protection may contend you
There's millions in the quest for synthetic dreams
It's now extreme and pullin' at the seams
I don't wait so it don't bother me
But please forgive me if I act rude
Save the bass for another part of me
But only if I wuz you

If I wuz you I think I'd find my way into the stars
If I wuz you I think I'd let me out of my jar
If I wuz you I don't think that I could ever be real

If you break off then things start to change. Then You realize that there's no time, 
No direction as you fly through the wind. you stop to ponder on a pink chateau.
The theme from ""Mohogany"" still transcends. But Quote Unqoute, that's the way it goes.
I'm looking at the picture again. I'm looking at the picture again.
I spin the sundial to expectation, twenty years ago I saw you yesterday.
You're looking at the picture. I see you looking at the picture now
And for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll.

One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll), paper doll

She used to be a pal real close to me
But she tried to hide from me what was in store
Tried to house me but a house has doors
I was insane and the picture was crazy
So the relevance here seems to be a bit hazy
But I tried to explain this in the simplest terms
But she let the cross burn and it was my turn to say,
""The roses are red, and violets are blue,j
and things are gonna stay that way, too""
And I was the nut to believe all of this
I figured life would just hand me bliss
Now I have to worry about certain doom
Or will I be here tomorrow afternoon
Now ask me about the future.

Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it

She said, ""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me""

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
So I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby, you send me
Baby, you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby, you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole

It doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
'Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on

Guess who's piece of the cake is Jack gone?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?

I feel for her, I really do
So I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby, you send me
Baby, you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby, you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby, you send me

Trying to capture at age twenty-one
? beauty's only skin deep
But love likes to sail when I exhale my lungs.
Fine wines, good times
To try to be an angel's pantomime
That's the ticket but a different definition than the soul defines
Does ""X"" mark spot on a single heart
When it's borne the billion's of Cupid's darts?
To try to spread love to the multitude...
But then there's the few that tears things apart.
Moonbeams condition my dreams
To its current shades of purple and green.
I'm convinced that my aura has the same glow,
And this produces my affection toward rainbows.
Wondering why
Why only my eyes embrace you?
As if I was blind, I persist to chase you.
Through my window I'm watching you smile at me.
And I live for the times when you profile for me.
The breeze, the wind
It fluctuates my adrenaline.
See, it's an ode to the fact you've put your colors on.
Now all I've got to do is tell you it's wrong,
And counteract my tears with a grin.
To balance your feelings in a mind that spins
Is to serenade a rainbow,
While riding on the tail of the wind.

Loving you is easy cause your beautiful.
I don't think so. I think that that's a lot of bull.
My heart and soul are completely taken over.
I'm sick from one of those love hangovers.
I watch the comedy called intellect
Which wraps the nooses around our necks.
It seems the unreal is becoming more real.
They've taken me down to strawberry fields.
Leave me at the tip of Orion's nose,
And play me a song that your heart composed.
Why you can blow me away and I can still see blue,
Agape compels me to love you.
Break me down until you see the sun.
I look at you and smile and you ask, ""How come?""
Father, I talk to you for peace of mind.

I'm so great I amaze myself
Explains, just how vain is vanity

The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because Pleasant Valley Sunday is
A grain of salt

They all show different sides of me, they're all wrapped

Shadows in the stars

And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show puzzle and stare
Singin' what it is, is what it was

'Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
Without transforming it to daily life
Is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife

And spots the mask as to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane

Po' you, watcha wanna do switch rooms?
And walk around space with your black and blue balloons
No, from what I hear, you used to dance in the face of fear
But now you're runnin' from the monkey on the moon
It's twelve o'clock, what makes a difference in the tides
Exploding paths to dismay, and if so
I'll never catch you with a runaround Sue
Playin peek-a-boo with ribbon in your fro hell no

Would you see me with a flower in my hand

No.
Would you try to love me

Caress the silk lines until it turns pink.

I'm using all that's within my reach
What conducts patterns of electricity
That leave me wandering oblivion's beach
OK, wait a minute, what's the big deal
I'm not allowed to be composed of lust.
Consider questions of a lonely man.
From clashes to ashes and greed to dust,
Okay, fine,where's the big wall,
It surpasses me, but its the cave through time.
Consider quotes from the understand what it takes.
To conditions your mind to be filthy rich.

I'm entering never, confusing the elements
Pondering all that needs to be done
Shamen life is performing an exorcism.
To rid me of all my guns
At innocence best its simply wild,
As intense as it is it can only crawl
I see my mind, its still descending,
At least for now I'm controlling its fall
OK, hold it, why the big smiles
It scrambles warnings and signals touch
Consider the passion for a thousand miles,
When the shady strides become a bit too much
OK, stop, where's the big find
I'm waiting for someone to tell me the deal
Consider yourself so wealthy
Without ever knowing how it feels to be filthy rich

It's getting dark, its time to go.

Flippin' mad styles when i prophesize the mayhems, catchin' wreck.

I'm gettin' filthy, nasty as LSD.
I'll make you insane, crazy, ill, flip, jiggle up and down.
Like House Of Pain, you'll wanna jump around.
And all that tryin' to fade me, I think you hit wrong.
PM Dawn got it goin' on.
So vacate or create a fake state of mind.
The new Czar, I'm Bizarre and too far to find.
Are you ready for the flava, I ain't your sucker, baby, don't front.
I'm hazardous like Bo, Luke and Daisy.
I'm burnin' up son, I think I got the fever.
Don't believe the hype 'cause if you do it might deceive ya.

Chins hit the floor 'cause I flaunts mad skills when

So take the reason out the spill and beam yourself to this.
Prince likes to flip so you better catch it quick.
I never slack, I'm intact, fade the quarterbacks.
Where's the new jack, the new act, the me act, the you act.
The reaction, no, I'm not the one.
Playin' ""rushin'"" roulette with all the bullets in the gun.
The ego, the frame, remain unemployed.
But they screamin' at me, they wanna be my freakazoid.
So PM Dawn, the center of envy.
'Cause who'd ya know that wasn't singing' baby you send me.
Here, there, Mr. Man you're everywhere.
The overweight lover with the dreads in his hair.
Once, twice, three times you missed it.
Prince Be's gone, either that or blissed-ed.
So they wanna know just what this flower's about.
One, two, check it out

So keep talkin' tough, you'll know soon enough.
That all that stuff leaves your soul in the dust.
So prior to my coming aloose and becoming a recluse,
I'm spreading that Nocturnal juice.
Hungry hungry hypocrites all upon my tip.
Atomic dogs with a bone and a stick.
Playin' it cool puts the fuse to the match.

So now I gotta flex in the steps of the truth,

Prince make a love song about a tech 9,
I thought Prince Be had to be Prince Be
Yet they wanna riff when they find I disagree
With that dog eat dog, I'm a get mine
Even if I'm steppin' on your frame of mind
You can ring things where the ringin' things at. 
But Prince Be thinks its widdack
So now I'm accused of spikin' the punch
And I'll be the scapegoat for fakin' the funk

You wanna picture me as you well, no way.
See I'm into innovations OK
Don't you know they itchy itchy me 
When they itchy itchy you
Passin' off the mic through the kissy kissy crew
What else can display through a mind that's foul.
Can the politics show you how, come on now
I refused to be used as an under cover clone 
Or even bad to the bone
Nocturna caps an ""Uh oh"" persona
That calculate traits that do what you wanna what
Tic toc me for the crazy fliz

Did you ever see a feather that could break a nut
They melt every time you heat 'em up

Let's pretend its true, no, facade. The vibe says seven, do I look surprised? No.
You, you're so disturbing. Anxious tears do these paint my eyes oh.
The mysterious fee no one sees. And no one tries. 
Whenever tangible,
I'll fall out of love. But for now my mind isn't mine

But exotic thoughts conclude this frenzy.

Why am I always misinterpreting my guilt? 
My happiness makes me sad sometimes,
And I'm no guardian angel but I can loan you mine,
They're tickling all my precious depressions

So melancholy's bringing me a little of what he calls paradise,
I'm bored with my elation, it humors me to tears sometimes,
But always manages to put a little hickey on everybody's mind
Why does everybody want me here, but no one here can give me reasons why.

Then it comes to you

And when you're overwhelmed by
How apathetic we are
You'll feel powerless
As you crucify your patience
Then it comes to you

They don't know that they hurt you
And when you forgive them for what they do

You get nothing

I'm trying to find you
But I don't know your ways
And baby you don't love your life

Contentions kill the days for trying it your way

All you fears and reasons in time will conquer you
But there's no further damage living in love
When asking for the answers, time will torture you
But there's no further damage living in love

Happiness hurts the sun for foolish reasons
But if you hate me so much then
Tell me why you're terrified to cry
So tell me you love me too
And finally I get to be you
But in your present state
Baby we can never unify our minds

Why can't I protect you from all the things that hatred does
It's making me feel guilty for living in love
When asking for the answers, time will torture you
But there's no further damage living in love

I saturate my anger with all the love I can muster
Which makes me rich in all hypocrisies, but to celibate to life
So you can have all the fun
And I'll tell you the reasons why
I don't find it fortunate to be loving you this much this way

Why can't I protect you from all the things that hatred does

Telling me to stay away but begging me not to go far

There's nothing wrong with your life
Yes I'm putting all the squares in the circles
Freedom's only grieving for you now
'Cause I'm not wasting no more lifetimes screaming at me

I can hear me now
Telling me I'm alright
Even when I break my heart.
No, there's nothing wrong with this life.
You can put all your worlds on this circle.
I can never kiss me goodbye.

Screaming at me.

You can't believe your whole world's on this circle very low.

P.M. Dawn,"I befriended my confusion quite some time ago
She tells me everything is gonna be alright (it's alright)
My senses make it real to me in all types of ways
But I'm so angry at my jealousy
That I hold it inside my heart like it's alright

Catapult my visions into realism's bosoms
Dreams prefer caesarian with plastic spoons and knives
That's what you get when your brain masturbates
There's no pleasure

So when I evacuate my intimate states
While screaming ""Oh how sweet it is to be loved by you""
The dirty rats you shoot me in the ass
So I don't know what happens when I free my mind

Oh, the cuts that you create let me be the martyr
If I started to love you now, there'd be no end to you
Oh, pick up my embrace. It lives without a reason.
'Cause if I killed you now there'd be no end to you.

Cure my house of cards she sends me tears from outerspace
I'm wondering can I not enjoy the pains I find (it's alright)

Mirrors give me confidence in needing myself
But I'm so terrified of being me I get so right

I'm tryin' real hard not to be exactly the way I am
The next time I come here all I'm bringing to this atmosphere
Is the will not to do it again
Understand, I got neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around broke my sacroiliac
Tryin' to keep sealed where this brother's really at
To tell the new millenium ""yo, what da dilly black""
You look cute in your stars and stripes she said are you coming out
Tonight
That's why whom ever loves me will have to be my killer
'Cause here I'm just a slave tryin to be the nigga

What's the use in pouring out my heart into
Situations I could cry thorough

Not to feel anything at all, even if it means
The most to you

Of my mind
Through the often closing doors of what's
To come, and what's in store.
Even if because you find I'm spending most
Of my love
To the often closed minds that must require
What you're living for

He who thinks, thinks for himself
A woman on trip, is a hit for the mind
A true composer's hell between tears

Megaline drops along upon a thought
A comatose nap might snatch a sandy
I'm so great I amaze myself
Explains, just how vain is vanity

The longest journey is based on a trip
But also starts with a single step
Because Pleasant Valley Sunday is
A grain of salt

But ""now or never's"" a bit hard to accept
Doncha' think?

Problems of the world, lovers, girls, and things of that nature bound
To break my heart
They all show different sides of me, they're all wrapped
Up inside of me
I feel certain awe for/but those who fall to find out they're in the
Shadows in the stars
Even from a watcher's point of view.

Yo the world doesn't pay for what a person knows
And rarely wants to pay for what a person does
But those who care show puzzle and stare
Singin' what it is, is what it was

'Cause he who learns the rules of wisdom
Without transforming it to daily life
Is a bad condition of contradiction
A rap like that can slap back afterlife

All this twists and spins in a whirlwind
And spots the mask as to where it remains
On the opposite lane of a fortress bridge
Or the thought that lives on the positive plane

Doncha' think?

Eternity and Judgement accompany death
The simplest thing to remember, really
Clog the fog of ""my forget""

Certain little mystery upon mankind lies
Certain arrogance, to the unexplained
Pure imagination is based on fact
Showing the confusion is made to contain

But the true definition of the phrase is a dream
A dream that encloses a question mark

Maybe they just wanna break my arm
Maybe they just wanna try and stop me
Maybe they just wanna do me harm
Maybe they don't want my mouth to speak this
Maybe they just wanna quiet momma

That's the minute that they don't wanna leave me alone

Children of God, Jesus' son
Gonna hit you hard, it's the hit man for Christ
Gonna steal your soul, you just might

You had no idea that Christians could be so hard core
We'll keep you flowing to the rhythm seeking more and more
Can you deal with it? 'cause this is real kid
You must be one in a mil if you can't feel it
How could you feel it boy if you don't move
How could you say you feel it if you don't groove
Just let your spirit go and keep going
Don't even try to stop this flow, it keeps coming
I see you there, you think you're really tough
But if you got soul you're rockin and ready to burst

But when I started rocking POD got the job done

One blow with the mic and the quincess is how I get 'em
Alternative thrash can you deal with it?
funk and groove with a hip hop feel to it
Giving you a style with a different kind of sound
So keep on rockin even when we bring it down

P.O.D.,"Wherefore, God had highly exalted Him and given Him a name 
Which is above every name 
And at the feet of Jesus every knee shall bow 
Of things of heaven, of things of earth and things under this earth 
And at the name of Jesus every tongue shall confess that he is King 
Under God the father 
Christ is king, He is God 
Who do you seek, you deny 
That in the beginning was the word the word was with God 
The word was God, so why do you fight 
Which were born, not of blood 
Nor of the will flesh, nor of the will of man 
But of God the word became flesh 
And dwelt among us and we beheld his glory 
Full of grace and truth 
Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue! 
Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue! 

Prophets of the past 
Claim the son of man would come with their hands lifted up 
And their eyes to the sky 
They proclaim the name of Jesus Christ 
People may ask why, who do you choose to live this life 
But they know the truth, for he is the truth, desperate is their life 
So what's the use 
Here's one for the phunky drummer 
Keep the rhythm rolling in your face 
I got the bass, without a trace he's going 
He's gone and I'm on the microphone and I'm known to get rough 
So take some time out my rhyme bro and strut your stuff 
Prophets we're four, I show you what's in store 
Give praises to my ring so now, can I get an encore? 
And keep clapping, keep clapping, keep clapping, keep clapping 
Hey, yo what's happening, brothers are getting jacked 
When you step to me with that disrespect 
I think it's time for us to put you evil butt in check 
And if you don't believe me, tell me who is next 
And somebody tell the devil, that his match is met 
From the word of God so you know it's the truth 
And I tell you with power chump, what you gonna do? 
I'll make it known again, that we're just spreading the good news 
And we'll have you crews saying your Jesus is one smooth dude 

Who's gonna bow down? Every knee! 
Who's gonna confess? Every tongue! 

Wherefore, God had highly exalted Him and given Him a name 
Which is above every name, and at the feet of Jesus every knee shall bow 
Of things of heaven, of things of earth and things under this earth 
And at the name of Jesus every tongue shall confess that he is King

Nobody unrerstands and nobody cares
Nobody listens, so who can tell my life is just a living hell!

If you could only see the pain and hurt in my soul
But you don't understand me so how could you know
Sometimes it gets so bad I think I'm losing it
Can't get my hand out of life and I'm losing my grip
And when you loose your grip you begin to slip
Death is just waiting one to trip
Heading down the path to nowhere
No one can hear me cause nobody's there
Life gets darker and there is no light at all
When the ways of this world just prepares me for the fall
What can I do what can I say
I don't know love, only hate
What would you do if you were me?
I guess you'll never know
How would it feel to walk in my shoes
A victim of this world only used and abused
Trapped in a box with the walls coming down on me
They say they know how I feel
Let's it end all right now, that's how I feel
Don't have a care in the world, life means nothing
Don't look back, don't look back, just keep running
RUN - keep running
RUN - keep running
How long o Lord? Will you forget me forever?
How long will you hide your face from me?
How long must I wrestle with my thoughts
And everyday have sorrow in my heart
How long will my enemy triumph over me?
Look at me and give me an answer o Lord my God
Give light to my eyes or I'll sleep in death
My enemy will say I overcame him
And my foes will rejoice at my fall
But I still believe in you Lord
And I know You're real, You're so real Lord
Come and take me from this place Lord
Everyday I will follow and see your face Lord
But I trust in your unfailable love
My heart rejoices Your salvation
I will sing to you my Lord
For He has been, for He has been good to me 
You're the one who rescued me
And You're the one who'll set me free

P.O.D.,"In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails

From the firefly, a red orange glow
See the face of fear running scared in the valley below

And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts where the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
You take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into a saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan
Outside is America

See the rain through a gaping wound

P.O.D.,"Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known
'Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care
Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I didn't really know this kid
He wasn't part of the class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

We are, We are, the youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of a gat

We are, We are, the youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense
Somebody's got to know

There's got to be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

We are, We are, the youth of the nation",Youth of the Nation

I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care 
Or thank my pops for all the talks 
And all the wisdom he shared 

Unaware, I just did what I always do 
Everyday, the same routine 
Before I skate off to school 

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest 
Instead of taking a test 
I took two to the chest 

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming 
Everybody was running 
But I couldn't hear nothing 

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast 
I don't really know this kid 
Even though I sit by him in class 

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love 
Or maybe for a moment 
He forgot who he was 
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged 
Whatever it was 
I know it's because 

[chorus:]
We are, We are, the youth of the nation 

Little Suzy, she was only twelve 
She was given the world 
With every chance to excel 

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell 
She might act kind of proud 
But no respect for herself 

She finds love in all the wrong places 
The same situations 
Just different faces 

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her 
Too bad he never told her 
She deserved much better 

Johnny boy always played the fool 
He broke all the rules 
So you would think he was cool 

He was never really one of the guys 
No matter how hard he tried 
Often thought of suicide 

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends 
He put his life to an end 
They might remember him then 

You cross the line and there's no turning back 
Told the world how he felt 
With the sound of a gat 

[chorus]
Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim 
No matter what you say 
It don't take away the pain 

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies 
Don't nobody know why 
It's the blind leading the blind 

I guess that's the way the story goes 
Will it ever make sense 
Somebody's got to know 

There's got to be more to life than this 
There's got to be more to everything 
I thought exists

Could take his mic around the world and flash the big S.D.

And time after time, I'm going in blind
I don't know which way I need to go

And I cry, failing to understand, I wish I can
It's alright if your missing him
In His eyes you can live again, free within

Time after time, I walk the fine line
Something keeps bringing me back
But time after time, I can't see the signs

Do all these roads lead me back to you?

I'm a killer that be murderin these tracks, so stay off.

And everybody out the box trying to cop my steezy
So my crew roll through, you know quite is kept
But my level is next, so bet it all on dread
I break bread with hustlers, conversate with kings
Conquer kingdoms with warriors and preach to the fiends
Partake communion with dealers, love the least of these
Ask forgiveness from a priest and keep my ears to the streets
Some of my people still fightin' they own demons
And some of my people still shootin' until it's even
Some kill you just because, and I'll leave it at that

I'm living this life
I'm givin' this lies
And how do I die for the name of what you think is right
And no more
Oh Lord
Is how do we know
And how do we know?",Tell Me Why
P.O.D.,"I don't belong
Too many wrongs
I'm so undeserving
I'm lost inside confusing minds 
A slave to what I'm feeling
Scared of what I'm thinking
I'm not worried about forgiving you
The simple truth

[Chorus: x3]
This ain't no ordinary love song
(This ain't no ordinary love song)

This love undone
Words left unsung
Now I have become me
The reasoning escapes my soul that leads to understanding
Loving you to death is stopping someone else from living too
Now it's killing you

[Chorus: x3]

Losing control to all my thoughts
I want to let go but I cannot
This is my love it's all I got
Don't take there in hell I'll rot

[x2]
This is my love it's all I got

[Chorus: x3]

This ain't no ordinary love",This Ain't No Ordinary Love Song
P.O.D.,"Rhythmically moving, 
Emotions are rising.
Quivering to music, 
Trembling bodies in song.
Go unsteadily sliding, devious gliding.
So beautifully sailing and floating on.

[Chorus]
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.
Life's real, When Angels & Serpents Dance.

Twistedly slipping, 
Radiance soaring.
Winding maliciously, creeping, flowing.
Righteous, moral, and just. 
Deceitful the creature is crawling.
The guardians flying, the dance is breathing,
Who's leading?

[Chorus: x2]

Who's leading? 
Leading you?
Everything you say, everything that you do!
Believe in what is true.
One must lead in the dance, 
Who's leading you?

[Chorus: x2]

Who's leading? Leading you?
Everything you say, everything that you do!
Believe in what is true.
One must lead in the dance, 
Who's leading you?",When Angels & Serpents Dance
P.O.D.,"Am I just floating around in this moment of time and space?
It makes me wonder.
A state of mind 'cause I'm just fading away
And my head is lost up in the satellites
I'm so far and gone to ever get it right
Through unseeing eyes, day dreaming again

Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time.
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever

Am I just hanging around all alone in my mindless haze?
It takes me under.
The infinite confined ready to blow you away
I'm too blind to see beyond the dead of night
But my spirit groans to see the after life
I'm so broken and small, come here and take me away

Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time.
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever

We live and we die, give in to faith and fear.
When my time is over, where do I go from here? Where do I go from here?

Eternity is seemingly an endless waiting.
Lost in forever
Eternally, a limitless time.
It's never ending
I'm lost in forever",Lost in Forever (Scream)
P.O.D.,"Tell the world 
Tell the whole world that you keep nothing back, hold nothing back 
Raise a single flag 
Raise it to tell everyone that Babylon will fall 
Her images and idols will be broken and destroyed, 
Will be broken and destroyed 

Yeah, ha ha 

Babylon is a murderer 
Crash down through the ground 
Like lightning thunder 
Pull the trigger and light you up 
In a world so ?

And her gods will be shattered 
Absolutely discredited 
Perfectly ?
For a nation will come down from the north 
With such destruction, and desolation 
And bring it all to an end 
Such death and demolition 
Such death and devastation 
That no one will ever live there again 

Yeah, ha ha 

Babylon is a murderer 
Crash down through the ground 
Like lightning thunder 
Pull the trigger and light you up 
In a world so ?

Pull the trigger 
And as we sat down, 
By the rivers of Babylon 
We wept, and we wept 
And we remembered, and we remembered Zion 
Pull the trigger 

Babylon is a murderer 
Crash down through the ground 
Like lightning thunder 
Pull the trigger and light you up 
In a world so ?",Babylon the Murderer
P.O.D.,"I like a girl with a big old a** 
'Cause I could see her body and mind harmonize 
And she's so fine, I can say love is blind 
But I know it got me shook, got me mesmerized 
The kind of girl when she steps in the room 
You know she steps to the room tune 
She's got a ? figure one of a kind gown 
Not someone else's costume! 
And this right don't come in to 
So I'm careful about who I choose 
These little ? can't dance on my tunes 
They're wasting time trying to fit your shoes 

And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls 
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma 
You know that I'm a bad boy 
I'm a bad boy! 
And I, I want a good girl to share my world 
To show you how I do it! 

And girl you know how I do, girl you know you've heard of my crew 
And girl, I'm looking for a love that's true 
Not some other hoe to do 
But when it's all set and done I need more than a hit and run 
But don't get me wrong, you could be real fun 
But it's time for me to find the one 
The one I want to spend the rest of my life with, 
The one to have too many kids with 
So I'ma ? and make you right 
Gonna turn you to a freak tonight, come on! 

And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls 
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma 
You know that I'm a bad boy 
I'm a bad boy! and I, 
I want a good girl to share my world 
To show you how I do it! 

And I love
I need a girl who's down to ride 
I need a party, I can be your card! 
I want a girl I could love to death like Romeo and Juliet 

And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls 
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma 
You know that I'm a bad boy 
I'm a bad boy! 
And I, I want a good girl to share my world 
To show you how I do it! 

? for your ? I'm gonna wait 
'Cause tomorrow I'ma take you home to meet my momma 
'Cause I, I want a good girl 
To share my world and show you how I do it!",Bad Boy
P.O.D.,"You stand with the gun in your hand
Staring at the wall with a look so sad
Thinking about who really cares
And will they even notice if I just disappeared
In one bang, blood rushed to the head
She'd rather fly through the sky than walk with the dead so
She stays high while the world goes by
Just another day here waiting to die

But life is beautiful
Share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o, why-o

And she cries but her man denies
It's funny how love comes with so many lies
He said he'd never do it again
So she puts on a smile and starts to pretend
And she hides all the pain inside
While filling up her arms with pretty little lines
She cuts with no intent to kill
This time she didn't do it
But someday she will

But life is beautiful
So share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When we sing why-o,
Why-o
And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o, why-o
And hey,
I know that you can find a way
You're beautiful to me
No matter what the people say
It's all gonna be okay
You're beautiful to me

Too weak, too weary to try
Too angry inside, well so am I
I'm all alone with nobody else
I'm so in need of help, I keep reminding myself

That life is beautiful
So share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When they sing why-o, why-o
And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing the song
When they sing why-o, why-o
And hey,
I know that you can find a way
You're beautiful to me
No matter what the people say
It's all gonna be okay
You're beautiful to me

It's all gonna end someday
It's all gonna fade away
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me",Beautiful
