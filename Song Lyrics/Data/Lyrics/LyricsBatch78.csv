Dusty Springfield,"Why am I chained to a memory?
Why does the thought of you still torture me?
When will I find someone to set me free?
So I won't be chained to a memory, mmm
 
Why am I chained to the hurt I knew?
Each day the thought of something so cruel to do
Where in this world will I escape from you?
So I won't be chained to a memory
 
Your letters threw them on the fire
Your pictures out the window
All that I could find that reminded me of you
I threw them all away
 
I get up in the morning
I'm pacing the floor
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory
 
Oh, yes I am
I get up in the morning
I'm pacing the floor
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory
Yes I am",Chained to a Memory
Dusty Springfield,"Here in this town of dirt and greed
Playground where devils play
Here where I had the bad, bad luck to be born
Here I must stay
 
Here I belong
Here I will die
Caught in the web of love
I can't escape
Won't even try
My fate is tied with the Corrupt Ones
Especially with one guy
 
He came around when I was down
Opened new worlds for me
Gave him my love
And dreamed of breaking my chains of misery
 
But I was wrong
I soon would learn
Thinking I'd leave this town
Here he found wealth
Money to burn
Not like the nowhere
Where he came from
And he would never return
 
Here I belong
Here I will die
Caught in the web of love
I can't escape
Won't even try
My fate is tied with the Corrupt Ones
Especially with one guy
 
Especially with one guy",The Corrupt Ones
Dusty Springfield,"Do re me fa so la ti
This little creature was a-passing me

And I can hear music, baby, when he talks

Forget about the dough and think about me, oh yeah

Dusty Springfield,"Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime guarantee
So, if they ask you what you mean to me
 
Don't call it love
Heavens above 
We got a better thing, mmm
Don't call it love
That ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
 
Nobody believes we got something they ain't got 
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
Burning as bright as any star
So, if they asked you what your feelings are
 
Don't call it love
Heavens above 
We got a better thing
So, don't call it love
That ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
 
Feels so good
Holding tight 
Through the night
Ah, but they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right, no, no, no
 
So, don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing
 
Don't call it love
That ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything, baby, please
 
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, yes we do, baby
 
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing
 
Don't call it love
That ain't enough

Don't call it love, ooh, ooh

Dusty Springfield,"If I lose this dream
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I lose this dream
I'm dreaming about for me and you
 
If it goes away
I might as well hang it up
'Cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind
To make it true
Or help it grow
And I only know, I only know, I only know

If I lose this dream
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes
You're the one I need
I don't want a love
That's second best
There've been all of my life
I wanted to do
That made me blue

Help me hold onto this dream
For sometimes dreams often come true
And they all come true, they all come true
For me and you
Wait a minute baby

Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me lose my dream, no
Baby, baby be strong

You say that a-you believe that what I say is true
And that I'm the one and only girl for you
Just tell me
That no matter what the people say
You're in my corner all the way
And I won't lose this dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me lose my dream, no
Baby, baby be strong

If only you might
Give me the night tonight

My heart's on ice
Come to me, care for me
Sing to me, share with me

Dusty Springfield,"(Guess who?)
Where's the girl who hurt herself last night?
(Guess who?)
Didn't kiss you and thought she was right
Everyone had told me
Be careful when he holds me
And I was

(Guess who?)
Had to listen to all that she hears
(Guess who?)
Has a pillow that's all wet with tears
You were oh, so tender
But I wouldn't surrender
Now you're gone

I told my friends, he'll never get my heart
And when I kissed you
Had to resist you
Said, better go
I hurt you so

Wished you had stayed
But I made you go away
(Guess who?)
Tried to be much too cool yesterday
(Guess who?)
Let the boy that she loves get away
I never should have listened
'Cause now your love I'm missin'
It's too late
Woah, it's too late, ah, ha

I never should have listened
'Cause now your love I'm missin'

Dusty Springfield,"He's got something
I don't know what but it's grand
I can feel it each time he touches my hand

When we walk
When we talk
Yeah
I feel so fine
He's got something
And it's mine, all mine

He's got something
I feel it each time we kiss
And he thrills me
Each time he holds me like this

When we part
Breaks my heart

Dusty Springfield,"In the land of make believe
You're mine tonight
Although you are far away
In the land of make believe
I'm holding you tight

The silver moon is shining above
And there's love in your eyes
And I'm kissing you
Like I used to do
Yesterday in paradise

I've been living in the land of make believe
Since you've been gone
I need you so much
That without your love
I must deceive myself
To go on

Your loving hand caresses my face
We embrace tenderly
Never will we part
Deep down in my heart
You are always here with me
You are always here with me
In the land of make believe
In the land of make believe
In the land of make believe

Your loving hand caresses my face
We embrace tenderly
Never will we part
Deep down in my heart

Dusty Springfield,"Ain't no miracle being born
People doin' it everyday
It ain't no miracle growing up, ah
People just grow that way
 
So it goes like it goes
Like the river flows
And time it rolls right on
And maybe what's good gets a little bit better
And maybe what's bad gets gone
 
Ah, bless the child of a working man
She knows too soon who she is
And bless the hands of a working man
Oh, he knows his soul is his
 
So it goes like it goes
Like the river flows
And time it rolls right on
And maybe what's good gets a little bit better
And maybe what's bad gets gone

And maybe what's bad gets gone",It Goes Like It Goes
Dusty Springfield,"It's like looking in the window of a fine boutique
Knowing there is nothing that I could ever buy
Still I want your love so much that I could die
But I just can't lead a double life
Being one man's lover, one man's wife

But you can start a fire raging
Just by touching me
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch, no
Oh, I never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first
Don't you see my heart's about to burst?

Let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and you will see
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door
Open up all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Sweet baby, please come over here

Let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me
So don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and you will see
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me

Dusty Springfield,"There is a garden
Something like the shadow of a butterfly
And lies beyond the gates of dark and light
And darling, it belongs to me

And when you go there
There will be such laughter in the dimpled sky
The songs you sing
Will drive away the night
The magic garden
Has a way of making you feel free

It's the place I've made for you
From match-boxes and cards and dominoes
And it won't fall down
And when your dreaming vanishes
Like snowflakes in the summer sky
Melts away in darkness
And you don't know why the magic garden
Waits without the gates wide open
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

And when your dreaming vanishes
Like snowflakes in the summer sky
Melts away in darkness
And you don't know why the magic garden
Waits without the gates wide open
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

It's so soft and warm
Behind those hedges
No hard edges
No hard edges

There is a garden
Vanishes like snowflakes in the summer sky
Melts away in darkness
And you don't know why the magic garden
Waits without the gates wide open
And darlin', I'll be standin' just inside",Magic Garden

Dusty Springfield,"You brush by me and my whole facade just melts
You seem a bit twisted but that makes me more intrigued
You drag yourself through a maze of alcohol and neon lies
Can't seem to hold on to your love
 
I'm sick of being submissive when I really want to scream
I know this is just a psychopathic dream
You leave me lying with my head in my hands
You've got blood in your eyes
Can't seem to understand your love
 
I'm not the vindictive kind, you bring that out in me
I've been inflicted with a lot of pain, you see
 
I'm so frustrated, want to tear my hair out
Can't seem to get a grip on your love
 
You deny me and my self-esteem just dies
You like to lash out when I dare to criticize
You drag yourself through a maze of drugs and alibis
Can't seem to understand your love
I want to shout it, want to shout it
Tear my hair out
I want to swear up and down

When everything is gettin' kinda groovy

And say: ""Alright""

Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you

I get confused I never know where I stand
And then you smile

If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dying to be sayin'

Dusty Springfield,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (the cotton was growin' fine)
But that was another place and another time",Willie and Laura Mae Jones
Dusty Springfield,"Spoken : Somehow, it seems the love I knew was always the most destructive kind

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
As rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease the candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the time ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah

Oh, yesterday when I was young
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
When I was young

Dusty Springfield,"Oh, I'm loving what I see
Each time you smile at me
I love the look of what you're thinking
I know how it feels to fly
I'm glowing like the sky that's on fire
As the sun is sinking

Oh, you set my dreams to music
As you spend the whole night making them come true
And in my whole life
I have never had a dream as sweet as you

No-one else I ever knew
Touch me quite like you
Or say as much
Without a word now
Love, I'm hoping you can see a song's inside of me
That holds more love
Than any song you've heard, now

As you spend the whole night making them come true
And in my whole life

Dusty Springfield,"I couldn't see paradise right before my eyes
When I had you here by my side
I didn't know that no one else
Could ever take your place

But, now I know
I know that I should have stayed
And seeing you tonight
I only wonder why I ever said, goodbye

Any other fool would never walk away
Even a fool would still be there holding you
Any other fool would know I never
Should have let you go

I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me, oh, ahh, oh

Anyone else never would have let the feeling die
Anyone else would have fought to keep it alive
If they were in my shoes, they'd know the love we had
Was love too good to lose

Any other fool would never walk away
Even a fool would still be there holding you
Oh, any other fool would know
I never should have let you go

I had it all when you were loving me
I had it all as any fool could see
Any other fool but me, oh, oh, oh

Dusty Springfield,"When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had faith in you
I, just kept on sayin'

Oh no, not my baby
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I, kept right on sayin'

Oh no, not my baby 
Oh no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""

Well, you might have had a last-minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you gave me your ring

Dusty Springfield,"Dearest, darlin'
I had to write to say that I won't be home anymore
For something happened to me
As I was driving home
And I'm not the same anymore

Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
I saw the welcoming light
And stopped to rest for the night

And that is when I saw him
As I pulled in outside of a small hotel
He was there
And so I walked up to him
Asked where I could get something to eat
And he showed me where

Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
He took me to the cafe
And he asked me if I would stay
I said ""okay""

Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play
And nighttime turned into day
As we were dancing closely
All of a sudden I lost control as he held me tight
And then he kissed me, caressed me
Told me he would die before he would let me out of his arms

Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
I hate to do this to you
But I've found somebody new
What can I do?
And I could never, never, never go home again",Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa
Dusty Springfield,"Riding on a big, white butterfly
I turned my [Incomprehensible] towards the sky
Closed my eyes to look for something
Saw myself as really nothing

Then I realized my butterfly
Wasn't really up there with me

Would you like to ride my butterfly?

Riding on a long blue paper plane
Getting seasick, sorry once again
Landing strip is getting nearer
Hope the fog lifts makes it clearer

Would you like to ride my paper plane?

All the heartache that he left behind
Will fade from my mind

How can I be sure where I stand with you?

How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

Dusty Springfield,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again

A coups de pourquoi

If you go away, if you go away, if you go away

If you go away, as I know you must

There's nobody to notice it
Can't I cry if I want to?
No one cares

Why can't I pretend
That you'll love me again?
All I had has been taken from me
Now I cry tears that never become me

Just one smile means forgiving
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my life worth living
A little dream to build my world upon

How I wish I could say
All the things I want to say
If some way, you could see what's in my heart
Oh, baby

I don't ask for much
A look, a smile, a touch
Try to forget
Lord knows, I'm trying
It's so hard to forget
When your whole world you know is dying

A little dream to build my world upon

Just one smile please forgiving
Just one kiss, hurt's all gone

Dusty Springfield,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground

Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Here she comes

That she is me
I can't disguise
See all her faces
Ah, ha, see all her faces

I'm looking for someone
Of the gentle kind
Knowing that looks can lie
Looking for someone
Is he there to find? 
Or should I run on by, ah, ha

Here she comes
Here she comes
Shadows sadly chasing
Every step she takes
Look at her now
She needs love so much more somehow
See all her faces
See all her faces

Look at my life
The wasted years
Each a knife
See all her faces, ah-ha
See all her faces

Who will set me free
Passing the time too fast

But, darling, can't you see
There's no one more important to me?
Oh, baby, can't you, please, see through me?
'Cause we're alone now, and
I'm singing this song for you
 
You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth, withholding nothing
You came out in front, I was hiding
Oh, but now I'm so much better
If the words don't come together
Just listen to the melody
'Cause my love's in there hiding

Oh, I love you in a place 
Where there's no space or time

Dusty Springfield,"Make sense of the world when it’s upside down

Was it something that I could prevent?
Oh I miss you like a piece is gone

Petals fall from her glance
Flowers sparkle with a dew of morning
Feathers float from her dance

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

Like a ray of sunshine

And leave their footprints in the sand

Just the fingers of your hand?

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Remain to love until they droop and die

Dutch Swing College Band,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Era el día más bonito si estabas conmigo

Son tus amigas, tu familia, tu hermana

Que alguien le ha dicho que han oído, que se habla
Siempre de todo menos bien de mí
Pero yo sé que tú te mueres de ganas
Que al fin y al cabo es lo que importa aquí

¿Por qué se meten en nuestro espacio?
Somos rebeldes, descontrolados

Quiero ver si el ritmo de tu corazón
Suena igual cuando sientas esta canción
Quiero ser aquel error que te marcó
Por saber que nunca podrá ser mejor

Quedan dos horas para verte en mi cuarto
Y hacer todo este sueño realidad
Todo mi cuerpo contigo lo comparto
Ya tú decides por dónde empezar

Ve poco a poco, que esta noche no hay prisa
Por fin llegó la hora de la verdad
En la mañana te pones mi camisa
Comerte a besos pa' desayunar

After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love

I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow

To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love

Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that
Can't we just slow down a minute and talk it out?

I've been through my share of love since then
Don't know about what you've been through
But nothin' compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back and I know that you need me back

To inc
Thoughts instead

This can't be love

Produced a shorty
Hard times would still be visual

And that's the bare-naked truth
And you need to
Take that as the truth

We probably still wouldn't have love
But we would love what we had
But we don't
Reality is we like
Now you and I must say goodbye
Can't you see the

I shoulda' been
Straight with you from the beginning
You probably wasn't even lookin' for a man

Too feel the groove and move your booty

Lets get down
Show me your step (step)
And don't hold back baby
Ill will show you mines
But mines is a little shady
This groove might make me
Learn how to dance maybe
If you promise me to step with me
But hold on, gotta let it breathe

[Chorus]
I know (I know)
Feel so (feel so) 
Feel so (feel so)
Good baby
Got to (got to)

Move your (move your)
Body baby
You know I 
Need you (need you)
By my side baby
Just move with me
From left to 
Right baby

Its a lot goin' on but you lookin' fly baby
That drink you holdin' keep it in the sky, please!
I paid way to much for you to be lettin it fly
Just hold on tighter the next one could be water
Or maybe juice cause you got me crazy on the floor
This I ain't used to, but im not ashamed to ask for more
Its almost deuces, before long they'll be closing doors
But I feel so good I might have to take you home

We go from the crib alone
To give up all body and soul
When it feels good baby
And when its time to dance
We can all hold hands and let go!

Feels so good I know

Dwele,"Aah ooh 

I'm better as a man and it's all because of you baby.
And now I understand when they say 'Behind a strong man there's you'
Some can't comprehend the words I speak on track 10 baby
But there's a new meaning for the truth
If the truth is in a pudding, you're jello pops are Cosby
If the truth is bare naked, then the truth, it look good on you
Simplified baby, we make it do what it do
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you.

I'm so glad you're mine, you're mine
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes.
Head toe, you're so fine, so defined.

Head toe, you're so fine, you're mine.
A few reasons why you're mine.

This song is my ode to you, for the twice time baby.
I learned a few things since the last time I told you the truth,
Got me outside with no umbrella and it's rainin'
But I don't mind your wetness, it's cool.
If we had computer love, I would let you hack my Myspace.
If your love was a dance, you could Youtube me and watch me.
You, you, you, you bring out the youth in an old soul baby.
And that's a few reasons why I'm with you

I'm so glad you're mine, so defined
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes.
Head toe you're so fine, so fine.
A few reasons why you're mine.

I'm so glad you're mine, my define
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes.
Head toe, you're so fine, so defined.
A few reasons why you're mine

It's true you got me trying to find things about you to not be so wrapped up in you,
But obvi-ously it's hopeless, that's why I wrote this.
I can't help but to focus on your ass, your smile, your eyes
Just gotta keep it truthful with myself cause in the end
I'ma want you for more than a friend.
If you ain't heard me, I'ma say it again.

I'm so, I'm so glad you're mine, you're mine
On a scale 1 to 10, you're about a couple of dimes.
Head toe, you're so fine, so fine.

You can reach me by trail-way

And painful scars are all that's left of me

And when I die, dear Lord, in heaven
Please take my soul from 'neath that cold, dark ground

When late that night they came and told her
He'd lost his life down in the Big Shoal Mine

Yet I still see the truth in the teachings of my youth
And I know that the Lord ain't turned away

The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie as he died

He said way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street
Then he drew a dying breath
And laid his head against my chest
Please Lord take his soul back home to Dixie

He said listen to me son while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see what life here has done to me?

And fell limp against my side

This window seat proved a poor choice
It shows the dream that's been destroyed

A little baby starts to cry
Hey, I would too, if not for pride
I owe so much to pride, it's true
It brought an end to me and you

But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery

I hear the engines, watch the clouds
The whole damn world looks distant now
But I can't seem to put no space
Between my cold heart and your sweet face

Across the aisle they're holding hands
Revealing brand new wedding bands
But our sweet gold, it's gone to rust
Now my life has turned to dust

But if I could, I'd turn around
Set my feet back on the ground
'Cause all this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery
All this plane ride holds for me
Is a thousand miles of misery

Like no other had before
Now his heart was just a token
Of all the pain it had endured

He might just as well been dead

And some people claim they still hear him call her name

Swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night or sometimes right at dawn
See his body died some years ago
But around here Mr. Johnson's love lives on

He seemed far away and distant
With that cold and silent stare
Never moving, never speaking
And just barely breathing air

And who can judge her right or wrong
The only true and solemn fact is
The man we'd known was all but gone

Dwight Yoakam,"I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
I sang Dixie as he died

He said way down yonder in the land of cotton
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street
he drew a dying breath
laid his head against my chest
Please Lord take his soul back home to Dixie

I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie as he died

He said listen to me son while you still can
Run back home to that Southern land
Don't you see what life here has done to me
Then he closed those old blue eyes
And fell limp against my side
No more pain, now he's safe back home in Dixie

I sang Dixie as he died
The people just walked on by as I cried
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride
So I sang Dixie as he died
I sang Dixie as he died",I Sang Dixie

One more name, one more name you call out in your sleep
One more name and I'll know it's not a lie
One more name, one more name that from your lips does creep
One more name and our love will surely die

Haunted and tortured by the rumours about you
Listening in silence to whispers of truth
Deceived by the soft kiss you forge every day
While each night those same lips give your secret away

One more name and I'll know it's not a lie

And measure with your hand

Across all of the land
Write it down add it up
And you might understand
About the distance between you and me
The distance between you and me

I lie awake and hear you breathing
Only inches from me in this bed
Not much space but it's all that we needed
To live alone now that our love is dead

I lie awake and hear you breathing

Winter hills are black
I'm all alone
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Headlights shine
Highway fades to black
It's my last ride
Sitting in the back
Of a long white Cadillac

Sometimes I blame it on a woman
The one that made my poor heart bleed
Sometimes I blame it on the money
Sometimes I blame it all on me

Train whistle cries
Lost on its own track
I close my eyes
I ain't never coming back

Clear plain truth about how
Deeply cruel it is to
Live a lie here with each other
And mourn a love that
Won't recover
As I recall those were the very
Words I heard you use

Wasn't it me who asked so

That our love would survive

This heart of stone sure is missing you
Sure is wishing you were back where love belongs
This heart of stone has not forgotten you
But broke while trying to pretend that it was strong

Memories have made its will grow tired and weak
Silently it turned from being bold to meek
'Til finally it gave into a sad defeat
Aching more and more with every fragile beat

[Chorus]

Loneliness has slowly stripped it of its pride

Dwight Yoakam,"Everywhere you go each day
I will be near you
Oh and dear you
Don't even have to say much
For me to hear you
Because it's clear you
Have a very simple way
To keep me near you

Oh yeah dear
Through the power of love
Through the power of love

Every morning, night and noon
I will be near you
Oh and dear you
Won't even have to do much
For me to feel you
Are sincere you
Like a magnet pulls so strong
It keeps me near you

Oh yeah dear
Through the power of love
Through the power of love

I could try to just lie
And tell people I'm free
Live a wave tellin' sand 
It won't go back to the sea
But what I say doesn't do no good
Like I ever thought I would

Everywhere you go each day
I will be near you

Dwight Yoakam,"I've seen 'em watch you and
Make plans what they'll do when
Someday you are no longer mine

I've heard 'em carry on about
How when I'm finally gone they're
Gonna treat you oh so fine

But I could have told them that
They'd never hold you if they tried

I could have told them
You bend and fold men who
Thought they would have you
As a prize
I could have told them
Those foolish soul'd men that
They'd never hold you if they tried

I've been made real aware of
Pleasure that they'll share with
You soon as I slip your mind

I've listened to 'em boast how
I'll just be a ghost once
They start takin' up your time

But I could have told them that
They'd never hold you if they tried",Never Hold You
Dwight Yoakam,"One more night and I know
That'll be over you
One more night and I know
That the worst is through
And if I can make this heart
Just believe it too
Then one more night and I know
That I'll be over you

One more night and I know
That I'll forget your voice
One more night and I know
That I can make that choice
And ignore the awful sounds
That come when love's destroyed
One more night and I know
That I'll forget your voice

I'll escape it 
If I learn to take it
And just survive two or three
Of the next million thoughts 
That I have about you and me (Bridge)

Dwight Yoakam,"This much I know
She'll never come back to me
This much I know
She meant what she said
This much I know
It's taught me all about misery
I just learn kinda slow
This much I know

This much I feel
I should have reached out to her
This much I feel
I tried it too late
This much I feel
How empty the world can be
And so painfully real
This much I feel

I've had second thoughts about
Every reason
We let love slip away
From our lives
And there's no place left to look
That I don't see some
Small reminder
Of all the chances
I just let go by

This much I need
To wake up once and find she's not gone
This much I need
But I'll never have
This much I need
Words to speak without missing her
Or just some new way to breathe
This much I need
",This Much I Know
Dwight Yoakam,"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
The little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
I love Thee Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

Beneath me Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
By me forever and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care

As he turns into the night and walks away
Lucille runs outside
Just to see if there might be a sleigh

At the plate where cookies still lay

Why momma said Santa can't stay

[Chorus]
Momma said Santa can't stay
Said she told him that twice yesterday
Then a car just like Dad's 
Pulled out and drove away
After mom said Santa couldn't stay

They both heard him coming
Saw Mom run down the hall and holler wait
Doug you're drunk don't come inside
I'm not joking I've had all this I can take
He threw a present really hard
That almost hit Mom's new boyfriend Ray
And yelled ho-ho lucky for you she's here
And said that Santa can't stay

As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild

Said Sam you're lookin' at a lonely lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time

For however long it is

A little lately

Changing man

You don't seem worried

This won't discourage

Drowning in them's just as well as
Drifting on this lonely sea of pain
Could have used another
Night or so to be recovered
Believe the lies I told myself
But just as long as you know

That's okay
It's alright
No, really everything is cool
This is just
The way I look
When I'm feeling like a fool

Voice about us softly mumbling
Words that trip my heart
is stumbling
To the ground and crawls there
on its knees
I'll embrace small shards of silence
To avoid a loss this violent
And survive love's darkest fears
Just as long as you know

Dwight Yoakam,"If deep in the night
You hear a voice calling
Lost and alone
Barely able to speak

With each weary step
Through cold shadows
they stumble
Blindly along
Frail, hopeless and weak

Chorus:

Won't you set out
a traveler's lantern
Just a small light
that they might see
To guide them back home
Before they wander
Into the dark billows
That crash on the sea

At dawn's rise you may find
The footprints of angels
Brought to fellowship there
By your mercy lamp's flame

Walking beside
The weary soul life's forgotten
Bringing comfort and love
And gently leading their way

I'll be fine
In time
But right now
I'm just trying to forget you
And clearly I have yet to
Succeed

I think I'll just leave now

Are useless arms with nothing left to do
Since these arms
Stopped holding you

These arms are worthless now to me
They let you go so how good could they be
Just foolish arms for which I have no need
A pair of arms that grew weak 
And set love free

Reaching out to embrace
A vacant memory
Finding just the empty space
Around what's left of me

Two arms that failed completely 
Arms both scarred so deeply
Keep paying love's costs with each tragic sway

Trying meekly to assist
My struggle with the truth
Unable to resist
What tears still make us view

Two arms that failed completely 
Arms both scarred so deeply
Keep paying love's costs with each tragic sway

Make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth

And you know how you think it'll work itself out

That she's not here with me tonight
And I know you were probably just acting polite

That we were drifting apart
But I was in what I guess you'd call denial
And I always heard they say that you're the last one to know
Well buddy I was last by a long, long while

You'll be sorry you asked me the reason
That she's not here with me tonight
And I know you were probably just acting polite
But you'll be sorry you ever asked why

Okay we both have the tendency to overreact
So I can't really tell you who's at fault
But there were certain third parties, well her sister for one
Who helped bring our reconciling to a drop-dead halt

You'll be sorry you asked me the reason
That she's not here with me tonight
And I know you were probably just acting polite
But you'll be sorry you ever asked why

Aren't you sorry you ever asked why
I'm sure sorry you ever asked why

Did I tell you how she tried to have me locked out of the house
I had to go hire a lawyer and all

The soft rope meant to tie me down

Long enough to change my mind

Lyin' here beside you
I can feel it start to pull me away
The thought I'll have again tomorrow
That just came back from yesterday
But your embrace makes any reason
For those memories hard to find
And I've been thinking about leaving

Sometimes I miss the warm, bright lights
Sometimes I miss the crowds
Sometimes I miss the women
I wrapped each song around
Sometimes I miss that world out there
So empty, hard and unkind

Sometimes I miss the noise
Sometimes I miss the fading sounds

Of trying to break free from the sadness
That I can't lay to rest

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From her memories driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me to forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose

Now if a tear should fall if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin'
while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owen's song
I know she won't mind she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own

No matter how hard I tried
Was foolish to have begun
To believe I'd ever outrun

And honey I had no call
To try and escape at all

Love caught up to me

Baby, I used to have ways
To avoid anyplace
That even had half the chance
To cut in on my dance

Yeah, my cool heart hung around
Only if it couldn't be found
But showed up permanently
When love caught up to me

The fascinations of each lie
I told myself were reasons why
The feeble boast I made alone
Sound faded worn and all outgrown

Hey, I could never afford
Honey, all it would cost
To replace what you do
If it ever got lost

But baby, I'd beg and steal
Just to keep how I feel
A way I never did need
Till love caught up to me

The fascinations of each lie
I told myself were reasons why
The feeble boast I made alone
Sound faded worn and all outgrown

Baby, I couldn't hide
No matter how hard I tried
Was foolish to have begun
To believe I'd ever outrun

And honey,I had no call
To try and escape at all
'Cause by the time I got free
Love caught up to me

Yeah, by the time I got free

Or else all night I'll be up again alright
What I straight up need to score is a place to cry.

This ain't over until once it's through
But once more's twice as much as I can use
Or care to try for my eyes to get dry
'Cause man the fix I need right now is a place to cry.

I don't need a lot just some quiet spot
That won't stain from tears
Please, I'd rather not see us both get caught
With cleaning up that could take years.

What starts hurting worst is not as strong as 
The aches that happen next, 
Then before long it passes by but not until I want to die
'Cause what I'm strung out for is a place to cry.

Dwight Yoakam,"I heard you swear your love this morning
And it caught me almost wanting to believe
The three little words that serve as warning
And say it's just a promise you can't keep

A statement that's been so used
I felt compelled to tell you
But knew there wasn't much to say
I could have threatened leavin'
Or listed hopeless reasons
If I didn't have this need to stay

Three little words should be my warning

There's always hope, but we don't ever let it show
'Cause hopes start out real small, but how they just grow
And, just like dreams, are better left alone
Is what we've found
When you're living on the sad side of town

Please never bring up how she used to laugh at night
Would smell so sweet and giggle when I squeezed her tight
If you can put a stop to that, there's a chance you might
Fit in here well enough to try this style of life

Dwight Yoakam,"The nighttime gets longer each morning I wake up
With sunlight that's long overdue
I start making plans for having thoughts that might take up
Some of the time that I'll spend missing you

Winters come a crawling after fall left me calling
For an end to what spring put me through
Summers only blessing had been the warm breeze caressing
All the time that I spent missing you

Minutes of misery drag through hours of memories
Past a voice that swears they're not true
It keeps avoiding, denying though but mostly just lying
About the time that I'll spend missing you

Winters come a crawling after fall left me calling
For an end to what spring put me through
Summers only blessing had been the warm breeze caressing

Baby what do you know about what that means

to be through
With everything I can't

So even if this worn-out heart was new
And all it's foolish hopes were true
This one lifetime just won't do
'Cause I cried enough tears for two

Dreamin' only served
To take my restless sleep

Leaving me with nothing more
Than endless years to weep

On the Las Vegas strip,
Where the preacher looks like Elvis;
We could even strike it rich.
Life is a gamble,
But our love's a sure bet.

How we got this far, God only knows.
Sold everything, don't need luxury.

Dwight Yoakam,"When I was a boy, my family would travel
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born
To a lost little town there that's all but remembered
So many times that my memories are worn.

[Chorus]
And, ""Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay?""
He said, ""I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mr. Peabody?s coal train has hauled it away.""

Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Aidrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot our pistols
Oh, but empty pop bottles is all we would kill.

[Chorus]

Well, the coal company came with the, world's largest shovel,
They tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Lord, they dug for their coal till the ground was forsaken
And wrote it all down as the, ""Progress of man.""

[Chorus]

When I die, let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just 5 miles away from wherever I am",Paradise
Dwight Yoakam,"I blame the vain for what we wear
And I blame the blind when we can't see
I blame it all on somebody else

I blame her mind for the thoughts we share
Whoa, and I blame her heart for the time we cared
I blame it all on how we used to be
'Til she's finally gone, then I'll just blame me

So go ahead and blame anything that you want
'Cause it all end up the same
When everything that you've been claiming is wrong

Oh and don't you know that blame
Is always never enough
It just keeps you in the game
'Til you've only got yourself left to bluff

I blame the vain for what we wear
And I blame the blind when we can't see

Dwight Yoakam,"Does it show as I watch her walking by?
Does it show that I'm trying not to cry?
Does it show that he's the reason why?
Does it show that every smile is a lie?

Does it show even when I am discreet?
Does it show I fall right down at her feet?
All on its own, my heart lets me know I'm love's biggest clown
Do you think that shows even when no one is around?

Please, tell me honestly
Am I fooling anyone
Or is the truth kinda hard not to see?

In ways that I'll never know, does it show?

Please, say it's not too late
So I can stop while there's still time
An' avoid me some small bit of ache

Does it show with each flickering memories final glow?
As night's cold shadows wrap around where hope let go
An' I sit there in the dark, does it show?

",Does It Show
Dwight Yoakam,"I wanna love again, feel young again
The way we did when it was true
Go back before I cried, or ever tried
To understand life without you

I wanna hold your hand and thus pretend
We're starting out brand new
I wanna love again, feel young again
The way we did when it was true

I wanna love again and softly mend
Any ache we ever knew
Then kiss till there's no place, not one small space
That our lips leave unused

I wanna have what takes my breath away
Be just the slightest touch from you
I wanna love again, feel young again
The way we did when it was true

Baby, there are countless reasons why
This is something only fools would try
But life sure gets lonely with just pride
So if you'll risk yours, I'll risk mine

I wanna love again, feel young again
The way we did when it was true
Go back before I cried, or ever tried
To understand life without you

I wanna hold your hand and just pretend
We're starting out brand new
I wanna love again, feel young again
The way we did when it was true

",I Wanna Love Again
Dwight Yoakam,"I'll make believe
That the sight of her in my head's seldom seen
And then insist
That I can't still taste the inside of her kiss

With luck in time
I might even fool myself with both those lies
Till there's no need
I'll make believe

I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long
Swear right up and down round here, there's nothin' wrong

With work my mind
Could cause the truth to get lost or hard to find
But until then
I'll just pretend

Oh, how I wish you could've seen her
Come crawlin' back a beggin' me
'Cause if you had, I wouldn't need her
Like I do so desperately

I'll just pretend
That she really never left me in the end
And all night long
Swear right up and down 'round here, there's nothing wrong

Dwight Yoakam,"She drove South I-95 straight through Carolina 
She didn't use no damn map to find her way 
She pulled off on a state route just north of Charlotte

That'll hurt a lot worse than the one he left in me 
Would you all step back? so a girl might to get started. 
And then he won't have to look twice to see.

She drove up across the yard and though his momma's garden 
Didn't touch the brakes, she slammed right into his Chevrolet 
Tossed out his clothes, boots, Bud cap, and signed Dale Jr. poster 
Then shot the whole mess neon green, a can of DuPont spray

Then she sprayed that Bud cap bright green, 
Said ""Connie put that can of spray paint down!"" 
Just watch this, 

Then she pulled them Nakona boots out, sprayed them neon too 
Put the can down Connie!
She give it hell with that can of spray paint 
He kept yelling at her

Put the can down 
And she sprayed to him ,
Then she did a little dance on top of that Dale Jr. poster, 
Just kind of a hoochie coochie 

""Alright! Connie,""
He said ""I saw ya Connie, now put it down"" 
Said ""watch this,"" run over to the passenger side of that Monte Carlo 
And she sprayed tramp 

On the hood, on the back of the house 
They tried to call her sister 
What was that girl's name? 
Said ""you gotta come get this girl!""

Nancy, I think. Said watch this,
Said look here,
Look here. Watch this!

She run that girl back up on the porch. 
She was screaming Tramp this and Tramp that

Dwight Yoakam,"Just passin' time with everyone I meet
I'm just passin' time as I wander through the streets
Just passin' time, wrestlin' with thoughts that fight my sleep
She left behind, just passin' time

I'm just passin' time inside these empty rooms
I'm just passin' time where small lost hopes still loom
Just passin' time appears unlikely to heal any wounds
Love is kind, I'm just passin' time

And time hangs around more every day
Why I keep searching
For a place that old thoughts might stay
And not just end up right back in my heart's way?

Time don't ever answer nothin' new
Least not here lately
In any way that I could use
For figurin' out what's left to lose

Dwight Yoakam,"Take her away
But don't let me see
Who the last heart in line
Turns out to be

I'll never know
There won't be any sign
How close it came
For the last heart in line

And though for awhile
I'll still be 
Waiting around for my chance
Patiently

The fact that she's gone
Is bound to finally dawn
On me, eventually

Though for awhile
I'll still be
Just waiting around for my chance

While What's Left Of It's Life 
Slip's Away
Well any tears that get shed
Ain't worth cryin
Cause I've Seen Plenty
I'm Lucky That Way

Have You Ever Heard a voice
Start to moanin'
After Despair's choked its
Last words away
Well any worse sound defies your ears even knowin'
And Lord I've Heard plenty
I'm Lucky That Way

So Wrap Your warm arms around me
And let our weak hands deal out love's sad fate

Then Press Your Soft Lips against me
And Let the first bets on new Love Be made

Have You ever watched a couple 
Where one stands crying
While begging the other
To please stay

It ain't worth the tryin'

Dwight Yoakam,"Another day
I spend alone
Here lately
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Early mornin's
I just suffer through Since feelin' empty's
What I'm bound to do
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

When every choice filled with regret Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember

Late afternoon
I curl up tight To fight back tears I'll shed all night
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Be no debatin' right or wrong
It's just a matter of how long
Those lies degend her
Then she'll remember

She'll try she'll try
But there won't be
No more escape
From her own lonely memories

Mine may be
The only scars that show
From every break
One heart could know 
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

Once all that's left is what's been used
And any chance to hide from the truth
Keeps gettin' slimmer
Then she'll remember

So, one more day
I'll spend alone
Like every other 
I cry and moan
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

The early mornin's
Late afternoons
Each empty night
I'm still sufferin' through
But she'll remember
Yea she'll remember

When every choice filled with regret
Even though they haven't yet
Make her thoughts surrender
Then she'll remember

Dwight Yoakam,"Well, I'll give you three good reasons for leavin'
Number one is that I've forgotten number two
Number three is in a place that's been kept hidden
For so long I can't remember but it's true

Then I'll give you three more reasons for leavin'
Where the first no, weren't so bad as the next two
But rest assured that the third will leave you grieving
From a tale that's as sad as it is true

Every night, all night long
I sit and count alone
But every day, nothin's new
I can't find one and two

Every night, all night long
I sit right there and count alone
But every day, nothin's new
I can't find one and two

Dwight Yoakam,"Watch how she tore me all apart
Watch how she ripped up my heart
Watch how she cut that thing clean through
Watch out she'll do the same to you

Watch how she wrecked love's hope filled train
Watch how she reveled in my shame
Watch how she learned me who was boss

It was gone before it ever went away
Got up and left before it even, really tried to stay
And any doubt that hung around, sure ain't here now
She's the best dirty trick, love's ever played

Watch how she tossed my affections 'round
Watch how she drug'em cross the ground
Watch how she claimed they're hers to use
Watch out or she'll drag yours for you

Watch out I never felt such pain
Watch out I've never been the same
Watch she don't need no excuse
Watch out she'll do the same to you

When I first came here
I was empty, lost and weak
When I first came here
In your arms I found relief
When I first came here
I was empty lost and weak
When I first came here
In your arms I found relief

When I first came here
I was searching for a friend
When I first came here
It was your heart that took me in
When I first came here
I was searching for a friend
When I first came here
It was your heart that took me in.

Though I wasn't wrong to long for your beauty
And my eyes were not blind to trust your smile
What they once never showed
Were the endless moments alone
That you'd leave behind

No, they once never showed
There ceaseless moments alone
Are that you'd leave behind

When I first came here
Your lips were where each thought began
When I first came here
My craving for you knew no end
When I first came here
Your lips were where each thought began
When I first came here
My craving for you wouldn't end

When I first came here
Each morning we woke spent and weak
When I first came here
We seldom used our bed for sleep
When I first came here
We woke each morning spent and weak
When I first came here
Our bed was seldom used for sleep

When I first came here
I fell victim to your touch
When I first came here
I sought and craved its constant clutch
When I first came here
I fell victim to your touch
When I first came here
I sought and craved its constant clutch

When I first came here
If my memory serves me right
When I first came here
You shared each breath I drew all night
When I first came here
If my memory serves me right
When I first came here
We shared each breath through every night

And that tears are only rain to make love grow,

Dwight Yoakam,"Baby now I understand 
How time can alter any plan then gently lead you to know 
Truth hopes lies will never show
Oh that love only pauses for a while and is always free to go

Honey I learned not to seek 
Any promise hearts must keep after mine had come to know 
And disappointedly so
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go

At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance

And though all those distant dreams 
Seldom turn out what they seem in the rush to let them grow 
Their loss had taught me to know
That love only pauses for a while and is always free to go

At every fading glance I reach to take it in my hands
As if that touch might be the one last chance

Two doors down there's a barstool
That knows me by name
And we sit there together
And wait for you
Two doors down there's a bottle
Where I take out my shame
And hold it up
For the whole world to view
Two doors down there's a pay phone
But no calls come in
Two doors down there's a memory
That won't ever end

From the hotel to the barroom
It's just a stumble and a fall
And sometimes when it gets bad
I've been known to crawl
Freedom from sorrow
Is just two doors away
I'll escape for a short time 
But I know I can't stay

Two doors down is where they'll find me
When you're finally through
Taking what's left of my life
Two doors down is where they'll leave me
When payment comes due

Two doors down I'll be forgotten

As a life filled with heartache over you
So if you're a playin' those dirty little games

El Profeta, con ?Mentes Criminales?
Para mi gente ilegal

¿Que es lo que te hare a ti según mejor que yo?
Una tarjeta verde ¿???
Sigo siendo ilegal, mente de criminal
why seguiré siendo un azteca siempre original
Porque yo represento a mi cultura why mis raíces
Es mi color oscuro es el orgullo de el que dices
Cruzando líneas absurdas llegado a otros países
Personas que quedan en el intento historias tristes
Ellos lo arriesgan todo por cambiar su situación
why a veces no hay salida solo desesperación
Entre la confusión why con la emigración
Una amnistía se convierte en su única ilusión
Nunca te dejes que nadie te humille why abajo te mires
Pues todos venimos del mismo lugar
No puedes juzgar, no puedes parar
Lo que mi destino me tiene no puede cambiar
Ni puede salvar
Las vidas de aquellos que tratan cruzar desiertos
why infiernos para aquellos llegar
why así continuar, sus sueños lograr
why así comenzar con una nueva vida
Por que tu sabes que la muerte siempre se termina
Por eso vivo yo la vida, why día a día
Le pido a Dios que me proteja why que me bendiga

(Chorus) X2
La sangre se derrama cuando el sueño no se alcanza
Poniéndonos barreras discriminando a la raza
La situación o presión why las leyes sin razón
Es pura depresión que nos lleva a la perdición

(¿?)
Discriminación habido siempre en el país
why esta gente no a cambiado siempre son así
La gente dice que nosotros estamos invadiendo
Este terreno es el terrero siempre a sido nuestro
Te hacen menos porque piensan que no eres nada
why para trabajo pesado son una cagada
Te discriminan nada más porque eres piel morena
El que trabajes horas extra esa es tu condena
Te ago música cabrones sigo de ilegal
why el desmadre con mi raza nunca va a parar
why una amnistía tampoco no la quieren dar
why es que no pueden con nosotros ni nos detendrán

(?Flaco?)
Encabronado aquí estoy
Muchos han hablado criticado, discriminado why humillado al mexicano
Ya no aguanto
Estoy arto, ¿?? aquí en mi cuarto
Veo retrato de mis ancestros
Me respaldo vivo luchando
Como Hidalgo pago un pacto why me destaco
why como malandro paro why salgo
Quieres ensayo yo te atrapo
Para que veas,  para que aprendas
why no te caiga de sorpresa
Ilegales o legales representan con firmeza
La sangre es sagrada why mas la mexicana
No importa lo que hagas
La vida se te acaba
La sangre se derrama
Día con día se van las almas
La muerte no me escama
Porque amenazas no me faltan
Pase lo que pase
Yo no paro en este jale
Ese, ya lo sabes porque a ?Flaco? le vale madre

(Chorus) X2
La sangre se derrama cuando el sueño no se alcanza
Poniéndonos barreras discriminando a la raza

La situación o presión why las leyes sin razón
Es pura depresión que nos lleva a la perdición

(¿?)
Derramo sangre 'fuckers' sentimientos
Guachando lo que me castiga
Yo nunca estoy contento
Si ve' la lágrimas caer goteando en el concreto
Yo 'toy una vida sin temor, Ese, why no me arrepiento
Por eso atento a las letras del abecedario
Soy criticado por la gente
Por que escribí un diario
Hablo de sangre, porque sangre corre por mis venas
En las escenas, las docenas, la envidia te quema
Por eso fumo why quemo mota, marihuana a diario
Para matar todo el dolor que me castiga a diario
Sin mi morrita, mi niñita que es mi corazón
Eso es mi inspiración para sobrevir' en esta prisión
Con la pasión agarro un cuete se la cerrajeo
La necesidad el más cabron
Aquí todo lo que debo
Ahí que pagar las deudas caras a mis camaradas
'I'd appreciate' todos los paros que me hicieron falta
I thank my homies for the back up in this
Cus they're involved in my shit
Now if it wasn't for my 'perros'
Then I wouldn't be shit
I want to let them busters know we 'locotes' for ever
Trying to come up in this game by slang'n the sticky 'loquera'
So if you're looking for 'la guerra'
Don't get to close I'm out to clog this shit
Just watch out for ???
I'm rappin guns, you're rappin color pens
Here to represent again
So fuck the ones who copy
You never even choke or smoke
But ???? It's a hobby
Reconoces de lo que pasa
Simón, 'homie' pura raza

Something about that pretty face that pretty smile.
You couldn't help but to get lost in those pretty eyes.
Yeah this girl she had it all,
The type of woman you take to mother
Saying look what I found, love and companionship.
Someone to talk through these rough times who ain't afraid to handle it.
And understand that my life is different and accepts it.
This isn't what I expected.
Yeah she's beautiful inside and out.
Something hard to find in the world these days.
Even on my worst day,
She's got me happy like a kid waking up on his birthday.
Yeah this love was different it was based on friendship.
I'm letting you know I'm ready to ride out with you.

Your the hottest looking honey that I seen in this town.
Come on lets conversate, take a walk get together.
Just wanna know you a little bit better.
Beauty incomparable eyes drove me crazy.
She that type I wanna have for my lady.
Something about you don't know what it is.
I know we just met but can I give you a kiss.
Grabbed her hand and she hugged me, acting kinda shy.
Dimples on your face got you looking pretty fly.
Baby this is real talk I wanna be with you.
Little did I know, you were digging me too.
Now I'm down on my knees got you saying I do.
So I had to write a song dedicated to you.

Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame
Esa mujer, esa mujer se fue, esa mujer
Esa mujer que ame, esa mujer

El eco de tu voz y tus palabras
Aun sigue aquí
Las huellas de tu paso por la casa
Las llevo en mí

Y el aire tan sutil de tu perfume
Que vive entre los pliegues de mi cama
Me embriaga amor
Me arrastra amor, me mata

Ah, desde que no estás aquí
Desde el principio del fin
Voy recorriendo las calles rodando
Y rodando buscando tu luz

Desde que no estás aquí
Desde que no se vivir
Parece que el tiempo vuela
Y nada consuela mi llanto por ti

Una mañana sin sol
Un día sin minutos
Una verdad sin razón
Así fue nuestro amor

Y estoy sufriendo porque
Esa mujer, esa mujer que ame, esa mujer
Esa mujer se fue, esa mujer
Esa mujer que ame, esa mujer

La luna no entrara por la ventana
Si tú no estás, seré como una estrella
Que se apaga, sí tu no estas

Ya nunca sonreirá la madurada
Si tu no estas no hay nada amor, no hay nada

Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda
Y tus caderas al andar
Y me gusta la infantil locura
Que te envuelve tu vida y tu verdad

Me gusta cuando me seduces
Y como te rindes a mí
Entregándote sin condiciones
Sin pedirme nada para ti

Me gusta que me pierdas el respeto
Y te vuelvas salvaje como yo
Contigo me siento un hombre completo
Y sin ti soy como un barco
A la deriva y sin timón

Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda
Me gusta cuando me seduce
Me gusta ver tu piel desnuda

Dyango,"Recordando me puse a soñar
Con lo que hemos vivido
Sin quererlo me puse a llorar
Al saber que te has ido

Es inútil que quieras
Buscar otro amor como el mío
Porque soy y seré sin igual
El que más te ha querido

Es en vano que quiera olvidar
Por más que lo he fingido
Si de nuevo te vengo a implorar
Que regreses conmigo

De rodillas le pido al señor
Que me quite el castigo
Y que te deje saber que yo soy el
Que más te ha querido

Si el destino nos vuelve
A juntar te prometo bien mío
Que mi vida te voy
A entregar como tanto lo ansío

Y te voy a adorar esta vez
Como nunca has sentido
Porque soy y por siempre
Seré el que más te ha querido

De rodillas le pido al señor
Que me quite el castigo
Y que te deje saber que yo soy el
Que más te ha querido

Jugar con fuego y rayos de sol
Y hacer con ellos una mujer

Y de caricias hizo su piel
De isla y volcán su corazón

Cuerpo de dunas cerca del mar
Alma de madre primeriza en placer
La voz de la guitarra
Al cantar suspira sin querer

¡Ay, Señor! ¡Dime quién es!
Mujer que vuelve loco al amor
Mujer de la cabeza a los pies

¡Ay, Señor! ¿Quién serás tú?
Dorada y reina en el interior
¡Roja y olé!, por el norte y el sur

¡Tierra del trigo! ¡Sierra de peñas!
Sueño contigo y aunque no se con
Qué sueñas, sé que quieres navegar

Esa mirada aventurera
Guarda entre lluvias de primavera
Penas de estatua
Que con lágrimas de cera
Aprendió a llorar

Y yo puedo ver en cuanto te miro
Pasar toda tu historia de mujer
Tan solo en un suspiro

¡Ay, Señor! ¡Dime quién es!

Mujer de la cabeza a los pies

Stumbled to find it end with a kiss
Brought home with all the days that we've missed staring into the night
The stars brightly shown, but slowly they faded
But that's all she wrote, and I can't even read it
Never let go; I'll be there just to hold you

And while we're all here; going to face our fears tonight

Hang out with all of our friends
On the hood of our cars
In a Walmart parking lot
Everybody in the town knew
That was our spot

But what they didn't know
Is where we would go
And kill the headlights
On a back road
And turn the radio to something real slow

And that was our song all summer long
And to this day, every time it comes on

In that midnight bliss

And the way you'd laugh
And the way you'd sit there in my lap

Didn't see what's going on
But now I know,
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on 
To somethin', you should go and love yourself

And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job,
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on 
To somethin', you should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all
And never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Love yourself
You should go and love yourself, yeah baby
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself",Love Yourself

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

Dylan Thomas Vance,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Dyland y Lenny,"Dicen que el amor tiene cosa de tontos
Que dar amor solo huele a problemas
Que si lo dejas se cuela de pronto
Pero que a veces no vale la pena
Porque le da comerse poco a poco
Cuando se aleja poco a poco duele
Y si duele, es mejor que vuele.

Tu déjalo ir
Ay ponlo a volar
Déjalo que se guille de comenta
Si está pa' ti, él volverá
Sea en una avión o en una bicicleta
El amor viene y va sin fundamento
Pero no siempre el amor tiene un cuento, feliz.

Dicen que el amor se va y si vuelve
Es porque quiere hacer su casa
En tu corazón y para siempre
Buscando ser feliz y amar de nuevo.

Y andar por las calles juntos
Como antes, solo déjalo que abra sus alas
Y que vuele, que si es tuyo volverá.

Tú solo dale tiempo al tiempo
Que haya brisa y viento
Y paciencia en este proceso tan lento
Bebé, todo pasa por una razón
Y más si se trata del corazón
Deja que vuele y si vuelve tu-tu-tuyo es.
Al contrario, hay que hacerlo, es necesario
Para olvidarte de esa relación
Que te sigue consumiendo a diario.

Deja espacio al corazón
Y si no me quieres escuchar
Deja que Lenny te diga que

El amor tiene fama
De poder volar (de poder volar)
De hacer feliz cuando es libre
Como el aire (como el aire)
El amor no reclama cuando tú no estás
Y simplemente se va
En busca de otro hogar
Y se va, se va

Tu déjalo ir
Ay ponlo a volar
Déjalo que se guille de comenta

The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin

And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS

Wastin time doing nothing

In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat

Pulled to the house get her out of the pad

Where the referee's son started way in advance
But still you living the American Dream
Silk PJ's, sheets and down pillows
Who the fuck would want to wake up?
You got it good like hot sex after the break up
Your four car garage it's just more space to take up
You even bought your mom a new whip scrap the jalopy
Thousand dollar habit, million dollar hobby
You a success story everybody want to copy
But few work for it, most get jerked for it
If you think that you could ignore it, you're ignorant
A fat wallet still never made a man free
They say to eat good, yo, you gotta swallow your pride
But dead that game plan, I'm not satisfied

[Chorus]
The poor get worked, the rich get richer
The world gets worse, do you get the picture?
The poor gets dead, the rich get depressed
The ugly get mad, the pretty get stressed
The ugly get violent, the pretty get gone
The old get stiff, the young get stepped on
Whoever told you that it was all good lied
So throw your fists up if you not satisfied

Are you satisfied?
I'm not satisfied

Hey yo, the air's still stale
The anthrax got my Ole Earth wearing a mask and gloves to get a meal 
I know a older guy that lost twelve close peeps on 9-1-1
While you kicking up punchlines and puns
Man fuck that shit, this is serious biz
By the time Bush is done, you won't know what time it is
If it's war time or jail time, time for promises
And time to figure out where the enemy is
The same devils that you used to love to hate
They got you so gassed and shook now, you scared to debate
The same ones that traded books for guns
Smuggled drugs for funds
And had fun letting off forty-one
But now it's all about NYPD caps 
And Pentagon bumper stickers
But yo, you still a nigga
It ain't right them cops and them firemen died
The shit is real tragic, but it damn sure ain't magic
It won't make the brutality disappear
It won't pull equality from behind your ear
It won't make a difference in a two-party country
If the president cheats, to win another four years
Now don't get me wrong, there's no place I'd rather be
The grass ain't greener on the other genocide
But tell Huey Freeman don't forget to cut the lawn
And uproot the weeds
'cause I'm not satisfied

[Chorus]
All this genocide
Is not justified
Are you satisfied?
I'm not satisfied

Yo, poison pushers making paper off of pipe dreams
They turned hip-hop to a get-rich-quick scheme
The rich minorities control the government
But they would have you believe we on the same team
So where you stand, huh?
What do you stand for?
Sit your ass down if you don't know the answer
Serious as cancer, this jam demands your undivided attention
Even on the dance floor
Grab the bull by the horns, the bucks by the antlers
Get yours, what're you sweating the next man for?
Get down, feel good to this, let it ride
But until we all free, I'll never be satisfied

[Chorus: x 2]

Are you satisfied? 
Whoever told you that it was all good lied
I'm not satisfied 
Throw your fists up if you not satisfied
Are you satisfied?
Whoever told you that it was all good lied
I'm not satisfied 
So throw your fists up
So throw your fists up
Throw your fists up",Satisfied

Your little girl is really
growing up now

And you will see
That my life will be so fine
And I'm gonna need you
even more now
It's hard to be
a woman sometimes

Needing you is natural

And when you're down and low
then I will be there
'Cause you can trust in me
I'll be there for you

E,"Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'mma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eating
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

See honey: there's a place called ""heaven"" and a place called ""hell""
A place called ""prison"" and a place called ""jail""
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nahhh)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

Wake up, sweepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!",Just the Two of Us

Has hit me in the mouth again
As we explore the carnal score
Of sacred and profane
Sulky boy won't drink his milk 
Mothers breast beneath the silk
Remains untouched it's way too much
Reject all of that ilk
I have to say it makes me wonder
If you are holding me
To the same blue flame that you are under
I feel you scolding me
Your virgin Mary's in the way
Hallucinate her face by day
Obscure the view in front of you
It's me here made of clay
You're playing near that line so thin,
Austerity? or just give in
To endless appetite,
Embrace that white oblivion?
I have to say it makes me wonder
If you are holding me
To the same blue flame that you are under
I feel you scolding me
And why so high the expectation?
Who could live up to this?
Well, there's no time now for explanation
Cold as an angel's kiss

The cat's out the bag and it's the end of your career
Don't spit it out, let it persevere
I like to see my dick snot disappear
I got inch out the edge, Lawnge Don can't compare
So, ho, come here!
Now some say they get live but the Sugar Dick is live-er
In and out of any situation like MacGuyver
If it's not Boopie's then it's Lady Godiva's
When it comes to hitting ass I'm a striver
I'll use my dick to fight a war so there won't be no survivor
Call me the Nine Point Fiver!
Cause I'm the sugar dick, the Sugar Dick Daddy Mr Lawnge
Of the Black Sheep here to point out what's wrong
With emcees like these popping that bullshit, please!?
Hang it up, black
If it's a God-given talent then take that shit back
Analyze the style, go home and re-write
I know you want to be down, I know you want to be like
ME! The Sugar Dick Daddy Lawnge
If you think that you can play me, nah, you're dead wrong
Cause I write lines and wreck minds
Being that I'm the DJ I can flip at any time
I'll diss you on the rhyme, diss you on the cut
Have you on the dick so much there's no room for my nuts
Forget rapping, you nerds are herbs
Just get a job and ride my dick to work
Respect the Lawnge one cause fly shit I mail out
Yo, you got the wrong one if you think I'll sell out
Used to have a ho and I'm damn glad we fell out
I would keep on rapping but it's time to break the hell out

Yo bust it, I be a fly nigga as far as niggas go
I be a choice brother but only a brother would know
Chilling Eskimo as the general rule
If you can't say Dres, you can call me cool
Styles unlimited, you can't get with it
But you can get this if you straddled and it fitted
I wondered and I pondered if your family were Roman
Cause you're snuggly and you're cuddly, play me closely like a Trojan
Ah-ah, it busted, aww shit, don't act dumb
You opened your mouth, black, so yo here I come
It's a catastrophic state but let it begin
If my dick's on your minds then my balls are on your chin
Now here it's kind rough, so kids stay on your toes
If my balls or on your chin then pubic hair is up your nose
If pubic hair is up your nose then I suppose
I'm the nigga that gets and you're the nigga that blows
My style is immeasurable so put away your ruler
Think of the coolest kid you know, Dres is cooler
Smoother, slicker, quicker roll-flicker
Honey came bloody so I hit her in the shitter
Went to a first stone caster cum a master blaster
Tell you cause I know, black, get off the slim faster
I know you want to emcee and be down with the rest
But stay on the head now cause that's what you do best
Your duck down sound compound no interest
Get down with the flock, motherfucker, invest
In the rhyming you're designing, I can see your shit climbing
To the bottom from the mid where it hid, bad timing?
What do you want to know, I still gotta go
You're a tic out of tac but I'm busy getting doe
Move over just a bit for the sight taking flight
Still eager as the Beaver and I'm leading with my right
I'll coin one more then step, daggonit

Mas não tenha pena se ele é matador

Eu quero um beijo de lascar o cano
Pois eu sou baiano

Chega pra perto, me dá um arrocho
Que eu já tô roxo de tato roer
Acende o fogo da minha fogueira

Que a noite inteira eu só faltei morrer

Vou traduzir

Na cabeça, no joelho, no peitinho
No bumbum, barriguinha, cinturinha
Essa Índia ainda mata um
Cacique quer ver bumbum mexer

E o pajé quer samba no pé
E o curandeiro tá de olho
No pandeiro

Do Brasil a Portugal sambando
Foi Cabral
Do Brasil a Potugal sambando
Foi Cabral

E'lissa Jones,"Embrace your darkness
Let her veil soothe your soul

Embrace your darkness
Let her magic free your mind

Embrace the night
Let her darkness seep your vein

Embrace the night, my child
Let her twilight hide your pain

No one is going to love, no how
Only the darkness
Only the nighttime
You can’t run away from your shadow

No one is going to save you, no how
Only the darkness
Only the nighttime
You can rut away in your sorrow

Embrace yourself
Thank the sun for its burning rays

Embrace yourself
Thank the sky for its glorious grace

Embrace the night
Let her darkness be your light

Check this out you been listenin' for awhile
Why don't you tell these niggas
What they really thinkin' about
When be wrappin' this mail

[Verse 1]
Turn my mail, I talk to rappers when I touch down
I'ma go by me a check with my bitches welfare check
And if I hurt her feelings who gives a fuck
I'm out for myself, bout to make me a smooth cover
I keep it on the under in a closet on the hush hush
On my way to victories downtown surplus
To get a blend aqua windbreaker
To match blue latchin' vendeta
Scadalism, that's what I'm majorin' in
Yeah, murderism I'm doin' niggas in
So give up the ghost my nigga
Remember me, I used to be your main nigga
But fuck ya, I'm jealous and I hate ya fuckin' guts
I got it in me cause ya clockin' do-do bucks
Break yourself, makin' quarters, ladies rings, chains
I'll take that cartridge out and set it on the range
Prepare for the jack if ya sellin' coke
As long as I got me a strap nigga, I'm never broke

As long as I got me a strap, I'm never broke

Got the nigga car at the mall on bricks
Beat strip, beat tip fucked him like a bitch
I'm that nigga to hate playas
A playa hater starvin' like Somalia
You got some yo-yo
Cause I'm right back chokin' again
Chokin' mo' now before I did when I went in
Tomorrow I got to go take a piss test for real
I'm tryin' to clean out my system with stay clean and golden seals
But I'm gon' be late, I'm on vacation
Because it's too early for me to go back on a violation
Fuck my P.O. I need some M-O
N-E-Y so I can get high and kick in this nigga's door
It's four in the morning I'm on a mission peep
The best time to catch a nigga in his sleep
Wake ya ass motherfucker I know ya rich
Tell me where the fuck is yours, I'ma bust ya bitch
Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
And made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke

Do dick in ya greasel I tie him up
Then I made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke

[Verse 3]
Baby crevice was tight like a pair of vice grips
I looked at pop and said ""You must got a lil' dick""
Havin' shame he was cryin' like a toddler
Nigga couldn't stand here baby scream and holler
I said ""You got one mo' time nigga where is the minl""
He said ""It's in the den right corner, top vent""
Folks remember that I'm scandalous and anti-fuckless
I carry diseases such as herpes and nut pluckers
Nutted in the bitch, kissed her on her lips
Made her get up and suck a little dick
The bitch had her some play though
Ya know she deep throat my big ol'
I dropped my strap like a sucker would
She said ""How does it feel"" I said ""Good""
She said ""You know this ain't the way to mix business with pleasure""
I said ""I know this ain't the weather to make miserable pleasure""
You know this ain't the weather to mix business and pleasure
Shit, she tried to bite off my pecker
Helped rex loose, I hangin' juice
And after juice you beggin' for this shit
Like you gon' knock it out better
Picked up my tech up off the ground
Pistol whipped, tied up sittin' down
I need a black screwdriver but a butter knife will do
To the vent I went to collect all my due
Struck out the side of boss game steward
Hopped in my hoo-ride made a left on Newark
Through the dark alleys black this black that
As long as I got me a strap look I'm never broke, yeah

I'm never broke

[Talking]
Oh I see
So what you're saying is a girl
Is something like an investment
Keep your revenues up to par
And all you need is a strap

Precisely that's how motherfuckers make them fat lick-backs
See I'm way respected in the rap industry
Cause I skip, spit that real-life type shit
Feel it, so let's hustle up the true motherfuckers

Where's the party at 

[Verse 1] 
Forget it man, I can't lie 
I'm drunk as a skunk but I'm nothin' funk 
I shoots the game, the gift I spit 
The gift of gab boy, the gift is ripped 
Deal with the skill that makes ya feel it 
Those that don't wanna feel it need to kill it 
Knows that I can giddy go 
When it's time to get on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E 
It's me the hustler 40 
With them raggedy seperaters as if it was funky 
A brother like me don't hang around no suckers that be faulty 
I be puttin' the group up in the boot 
Be puttin' the peas up in the pod 
Left the cookies in the jar, now I'm a rap star 
The rapologist, I pull a 40 out of my ball cap 
Then I bust ya down side of this 
Cause partner ain't never been no punk in this 
I'm so serious brother, I got meals, wheels 
And about seven thousand dollars worth of bills 
Givin' up deals, hills let em' go for a lil' nothin' 
As I showcase my skills for real 

[Hook x2] 
There's a party over here, a party over there 
A party everywhere...put ya hands up 
There's a party over here, a party over there 
A party everywhere 

[Verse 2] 
Pullin' up in the club about eleven 
I plays my feet and hit the beat and kept it revvin' 
I got a lil' doja that I'm fixin' to break down 
Roll em' up in a zag, lick em' stick em' and clown 
I'm fully dig with a dick, my game is on hit 
I got tipped so I tip cause I'm livin' with this 
Game tight with the knack, I'm pullin' in scratch 
They better have a tight grip on they stuff cause I'm bout to snatch 
Your batch if she wants it she'll be mine in the Cutlass 
Puffin' on some of this chronic while I'm gettin' straight laced 
Heard about the drought season, they be lookin' for a reason 
It's like Thanksgiving without the feastin' 

Extra manish how I'm livin' and my name is groupie 
It's Mr. 30-30 givin' up game to all you hoochies 
Bitches always splittin' stick the wood but sometimes wouldn't 
Suckin' and grabbin' my little pecker 
Talkin' about sick on my gold better 

I remember when carts was Barbie cut before I was in junior high 
All they wanted to do is kiss and let me play with they vagina 
I got my freshen up, I put on my chucks, also down with pluck 
Th finest watch on the playground, the one with the big ass butt 
40 I love you, I miss you, I need you 
And retrospect to who 
Bitch come anew, bitch come anew 

[Hook x2] 

[Verse 3] 
Cause we made like thugs 
Get juiced in the parking lot before we go up in the clubs 
Hugs and kisses, gotta make sure we got our gloves 
Hugs and kisses, E-40 can't be on any more 
Hugs and kisses, straight to the bar no time to waste 
Kickin' em' back while they take the place 
Order me a shot of that liquor to taste 
Thinkin' they about to beat my face 
Oh no, I'm nothin' but a professional 
Oh no, we're nothin' but professionals 

Hoochies all in my face with some of that dope water 
Brothers already purple off some of that soap water 
So I'ma make a toast to the most 
Mobbish lookin' brothers in this by midnight 
Cause brothers gotta get the shit that's really in man 
Batches on our jock, batches on our jock 
Mind teachin' things to these brothers 
Cause that's us, Captain Save a botch 
They wanna be like big boys and sport big loot 
They wanna be like big boys and sport fresh suits 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me 
I got love for D-Boys cause D-Boys got love from me

Bloody murder, crime, drugs, folks smokin' 
Man I remember when it used to be cool to leave ya screen door open 
And let the mosquitos and the flies sneak in 
Look mama and them play whistle 
So I'ma play tackle football with my friends 
I guess them times is gone cause like a wishbone 
I wish I had em' back instead of watchin' brothers fiz-all 
Catch em' out on every track, bar, street, boulevards 
Sweet avenues with dead ends, neighborhoods with antens 
Whatever happened to the days of Little League 
Pop Warner and Boy Scouts, the Old Singing Boys Club 
Voodoo to go to school not thinkin' 
Too busy smokin' weed, sellin' dope and drinkin' 
I guess we're livin' in the last days 
Cause in the last days the Bible speaksof AIDS 
Plagues, brothers killin' brothers, earthquakes 
Youngsters tryin' to earn stripes as a work face 
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card 
I used to be soft but now I'm hard 
Fuckin' nigga, I practice lookin' hard 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Mirror, mirror make the call 
Who's the hardest of them all 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 

[Verse 2] 
Take yo mean face off partner why ya muggin' me 
Fools say shit, I can't help that shit's in me 
It's automatic cause what's mine ain't even took 
It's my mad at the world look 
I said I feel ya man, sometimes I catch myself too 
Mean muggin' folks that did no harm to me or my crew 
But now it shouldn't have to be this way 
Fools say, I don't care what nobody say 
The other man got me this way 
I'm fresh out the pen and out the system for years 
Been fillin' out all kinds of applications to make a grip 
But I don't know nothin' about no computer chip 
It takes that to make a J-O-B in the 93 
But a J-O-B in 93 consists of paper rarely 
Jobs like the oil refinery 
I'd rather work in Napa at the winery 
And then ya wonder why I'm stubborn 
Forever lookin' hard, I been scarred

I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard

[Verse 3] 
Can't tell me shit, I come from a broken up home 
Every since I was a youth I thought that I was grown 
Meet me after school nigga and we can get it on 
Ya talked about my mammy now I'm goin' upside ya dome 
I got a complex problem, my guard stay up 
I'm always on the offense side, don't test my nuts 
I'm not a Charles nor a Larry but I'm scary 
Scared that I might lose it and chop you with my piece berry 
I deep into my shit and it's straight like that 
I be quick to clobber a motherfucker with my Flintstone bat 
Nobody likes me on my father's side of the family 
They can't stand me cause they think that I'm sellin' that candy 
I kid you not, all bullshit to the side 
I got 20,000 niggas in my organization 
Now which one of y'all niggas down to ride 
I gets juiced off the underground doja 
You know that Click shit, that independent shit 
It makes me feel like I want to 
Got me a baggy full of broccoli and a crooked eye 22 
I feel crafty, I mean that but I feel great

I got my cousin Kaveo on the muthafuckin side of me
We fin to spit some of this old flamboyant shit, check game-
It`s another one of them drought spots, a ha-bin cost is like fuck it 
Niggaz taken loses that they can`t make up
Gettin gaffled for some of that shit call cake-up
Strechin the crap, making a bad batch
The screen from a trweekers pipe turns black 
So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin` a fool yellin`
But ya`ll know there ain`t no refunds in the shit that I`m sellin
'cause during the drought season niggaz be lookin` for a reason to rush ya 
So I suggest you put up your bootsees man and pull out your buckets
(kaveo)
Here`s another part of this shit that a niggaz up lift about the game
The drought season main, 'cause this shit here never remains the same
And a brother ain`t about to let his muthafuckin capital go mein
So instead he gots to get scandlous 
'cause he can`t keep up and handle hisbuisness
Like he use to and he ain`t really wit being through, get to it dude
Gotta pull a straight come-up, lick
Catchin` muthafuckas outta bounds swerv, 
Breakin they punk ass leavin scared
'cause this is the type of shit that occur 
So don`t get caught loose on perv

I gots meals, wheels, and about 5 thousand dollars worth of bills
Bank account way on the red, fuckin with the highest overhead
Jackin off my money yo ass is out boy and I promise you that
I`m a money hungry muthafucka and I`m so serious about my scratch
So you`re best bet is 
To check yourself before you wreck yourself punk botch
I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth and I put that on the Gooch 
Droppin muthafuckas just like a bad habit, Dag nab it
Tricks want to get outta line I let `em have it
Now bag it, I gots Ice Cream Candy 
And all kinds of things of that flavor 
And maybe later I might be willing to go low as long as you buyer before
'cause I`m the only muthafucka with A-1 Yola, 
None of that ol caken with baking soda
It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast 
Those who gots leftovers will become obese, 
Triplin` my mail off the triple beam scale
I even got enemies with envy askin` me for yayo

The Drought Season niggaz lookin` for a reason 
It`s like Thanksgiving without the feast -n (2 x)

A niggaz tryin to work hard on a meal ticket so I can`t stand to be dry
'cause after the stronger man supply 
But in the drought season it`s too hard to get by
Niggaz be runnin` off with D gafflin muthafuckas, startin at chances
'cause a niggaz mail ain`t to muthafucka fancy, 
Rollin around with a duece and a quarter 
Can`t get caught lose on the border, sittin on them thangs like 40
Stay fuckin with a bitches brain
(40)
Can`t be affected by the great depression 
This country is in a recession, I reckon
So let me give yo ass a funky lesson-
Never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin
It`s dem bootsee muthafuckas in your town that`s always dyin`
Stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush mate
Hit it hard one time and then hibernate 
(Kaveo)
Now check game I`m tryin to do my own muthafuckin` thang 
But shit just ain`t right
For heaters that just got way to tight, Jackin muthafucka`s on sight
But I`m a nigga that don`t give a fuck 
When I`m tryin to get my cashflow up
And render them seasons what ever the reason may be, niggaz comin up
Short tye, Gag, Watch em short out from sea, 
For sale signs on a nigga`s shit 
'cause he ain`t got no muthafuckin` D,

 What`s your definition of a lick?
Takin` a niggas shit
 Hey, put that on sumptin
I put that on the click,
If you consider yourself a hustla can`t be no busta brown
Stackin mail, straight come upin`, when funk come around be down
(Kaveo) 
A nigga`s gotta have some type of hustle 
Whether it be sellin` Dank or robbin banks
Snitches can`t go to the pen 'cause they fuck around and wind up shanked
In the presence of drought season shit gets hectic 
Niggaz losin they lives when they least expect it
(E-40)
It`s E-40 and my cousin Kaveo lettin` muthafuckas know main
Spittin that ol shit that muthafuckas don`t understand an
Tardy to the crazy ass game, never gotta be clever
Specially in this type of weather, Ya Know?
The Drought Season

E-40,"I'm a little mannish muthafucka
I take after my older brother
Started off selling marijuana but now I'm selling yola
Shit was gettin' hella funky at first 
When a nigga was stealin' a bitches purse
Ended up gettin' kicked out of every Vallejo school 
They clocked me like a circus
I was the little mannish motherfucker showing off in the back of the church
My momma was quick to hit me with a switch and I say ""that hurts""
Get to the house, go to my room and talk some trash
I never believed a hard head made a soft ass
Cause I be moving fast and I'd be tryin' to stash
Beat up the pizza man and then I straight dashed
Disobedient sport cut my days short
My momma got tired of takin' my ass back and forth ta court
I said ""momma I'ma straighten up for you and I promise I won't warrant""
Got me a job as a paper boy 
Twenty one dollars a month
Five o'clock in the morning 
Damn I'm slavin' for the fucking white man
Twenty one dollars might buy me some ??(poor carpet chicken george)
I'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin' over me
How can I find a way to make some real money?
But you don't feel me 
I was tired of being broke lookin' coked down
Came up off a twenty dollar put me down
Next thing you know I was up to about a quarter of a ki' rollin'
Niggaz was trippin' off me 'cause I was a young muthafucka ballin'
Gettin' my fetti on but when there was funk I had to starve 
Time to fetch the choppers and bring out the you-hauls
Extra mannish 
I make you vanish
I play for keep
Investigate that ass till they find out where you sleep
Muthafucka it's commakausi
Don't even try me ahh
I bars none you best believe that I'ma bring me ah
Fully automatic Tommy with the infared say I'm sorry
Before I pump your ass full of lead and dump the body
Extra mannish, that's what people be calling me
Oh we can be cool until you get to threatening me
I loose my temper and shit my eyes turn red 
Blow my top and get real hot at the head
I guess I'm a failure, I gots no future in my front
All I'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
Don't ask me why Sometimes I go to church and testify
The preacher preaches and I be dang near ready to cry
Repute the devil
I got to get out of the ghetto freak
Sometimes I wonder if mommy and daddy really payin' me
Who would ever thought that a nigga like me 
Would become such a bad ass youngster
My mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
Why couldn't I wait till I was bigger 
Before I started drinking malt liquor 
I guess I was a nappy headed stubborn little mannish ass nigga

Guess who comes through, comes through
It's me the why-O-you-N-G
M-you-G-Z
I'm just as mannish as I wanna be I pack a 30-30
Niggas wanna blast me because I'm down and dirty
Extra mannish how I'm livin' and I'm fuckin' my neighbors bitch an
She lovin' every minute of the dick that I be givin'
Bitches on my jock , Bitches on my jock
Suckas on the block know I got a glock
Bini caps, be-coats and all of that
I'm beatin' niggas down with a baseball bat
I'm havin' revenues I'm gettin' paid fool

1979 I been a hustler on the go
Pop-pos want to harass
Me and my Keesh I needed cash
Rocks wasn't groovin' at the time

I'm in some deep shit, I got some niggas from another click
On that ass trying to run me off a fuckin cliff
What should I do? Where should go?
How could I fake 'em?
Bust a bitch on that ass and try and shake em and bake em
Full speed ahead, I know they want my ass dead
Still on my bumper, makes a motherfucker wonder
All the dirt that I did, should just let them get me
Maybe its because I killed Rodney and his whole family
Revenge, I see my life flashing, niggas blasting
Brothas passing, trying to make me stay crashing
Into the rocks beside me, fucking up the traffic
17th in a Malibu Chevy classic
But I'm nothing humble, just call me Yapeez Pasano
Full tank of petro, mobbin through the fucking tunnel
Shit it's bright, I think I see some daylight
Over the night, you should have seen a brothas sides right
Fit the corners on two shoes, I'm holly G
Wrapping my shit around a fifty foot oak tree
Got out the car, seeing stars, I wasn't lagging
Ran out and hid behind a beat up station wagon
[Hook]
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast
[E-40]
Bouncing, sneaking, and peaking, hitting bushes and shit
Never saw, like you did in that movie clip
Steady busting, these motherfuckers ain't bluffing
I'm hauling ass and renting bullets, constantly cussing
Scared as fuck, I wasn't trying to act hard
Thumbs up, and ran in a back yard
Just as I was hoping the sliding door was wide open
Out of breath, I locked the door and started talking
I need some help, I gotta bounce, someone's after me
Please don't panic, I need your help drasticly
I'm not a G, a killer, or a rapist
I'm just a ordinary black man trying to make this
Busting my bubble, the couple didn't even freak
They said relax, I'll make some coffee, have a seat
The man said, what's your name bro
Shit I don't know, you might decide to call the po-po
He said that ain't my thang, I used to be a leader of a gang
Shot twice in my chest
I got wounds, where I've been stabbed
He took off his shirt and showed my his scab
I said damn partner, how the fuck you survive some shit like that
Like that there without going into a coma
He said the Lord spared my life
So I could talk to people like you and teach them right
I was a dope pusher, big time drug abuser
Alcoholic, dog blumer, but a shooter
All together working from the floor
I said I better twist so I can call her
Now I'm reached from coast to coast
Said to saved from the holy ghost
I know you think your trapping
But let me pray for you junior and see what happens",Hide 'N' Seek
E-40,"I never stayed my ass home I always thought that I was grown
In the traffic I was gone you see my head was made of stone
Got a problem with me?
Then feel free motherfucker 
Don't be talkin' under yo breath
'cause that might be the cause of your death
'cause I'm a quick to stop a nigga in his tracks main
So lets get this shit out in the open
I used to like to go from the shoulders get em up, one on ones
Now it's a whole different ball game niggas that carry guns
A sucka will kill you first, and you will be layin' in the hurst
Takin' a deep ass sleep knowin' it wasn't worth
Provin' you wasn't a punk
Niggas don't want to thump
Niggas just want to funk and shot up a niggas trunk
I met a bitch last week at the Orgen Room
Bought her a drink and said ""what's up on the telly room?""
Just then I felt some trouble kickin' in
Spotted her X-boyfriend who had just got out the pen
Motherfuckers get to baulkin' when the liquors talkin'
Drunk motherfucka' step on my toe and kept on walkin'
I said ""what's up with ya potna, say excuse me or somethin'""
He turned around looked at me and started mean muggin'
I guess he thought he pumped fear until I said 
""Nigga don't you know I'll have you touchin' everything in here""
He went for his pistol and didn't know I was strapin'
Dag nab it, I had to let him have it

What type of nigga did he think you was E? 
I know he didn't think that you were some kind of peanut or somethin'. 
He must of been retarded to the fact that you get a thrill out of killin'
Now tell me somethin' why do motherfuckers wait till that nigga commits
Himself to realize that a hillside hillbilly is the wrong type of
Nigga to Fuck with? E do you feel me?
Yeah I feel ya sahob
Well lets take it to the next page then
Oh you mean that part about the dungeon?
You know!

The next morning, I'm sittin' in the dungeon-wonderin'
Should I be dissed nope I did it in self defense
I wasn't twisted, I hadn't even started yet
It happened to fast before someone could stop me
I wish I had some dank weed
While I wait out these 24 more hours before I plead
Freedom I'm gonna miss ya (I wish I had some dice)
Made me some dice out of some water and toilet tissue
Now this the part that's fucked up
I walks into the day room manner room what the fuck
I never thought that I would straight make ah
The front page of the newspaper
Shut up a do wop, shut up a do wop
Man they bout to send me up state ah
Talking that shit about makin' me a motheruckin' faggot 
I make a shank outta plastic and let a nigga have it

That's what's really goin' down
'cause when a motherfuckers down for the count
You gotta be about it or be without it
'cause what a motherfucker once told me see a mark sleep
Leave him sleep in the middle of the street
If you can't stand the heat stay up out the kitchen

Now I'm still in the county's face
Fighting this funky ass 187 case
Shoot me a kite that's a good way to mingle
I'll be in this bitch eatin' shit on the fuckin' shingle 
Gettin' big as a house, bulkin' up
400 club waiting for the Mercedes deep roll it up
My dream came true after almost 2 years of incarceration 
Now I'm out drinkin' brew havin' fun with my folks
Lovin' everybody gettin' twisted and crackin jokes
Huggin' anybody cryin' 
I missed every nigga in my click and I ain't lyin'
We bones out to a party 
I'm on P-role but what can I say
I can't let em know I'm stuck
I roast bitches but I'm not a damn peanut
Now I'm at the party thought I wasn't
Dancin' with the dead niggas fine ass cousin
I wonder if she thinkin' my my my
The bitch been lovin' me ever since Hogan High

Three damn strikes no chances left
Let me tell ya lil bout me
E-40 and the C-L-I-C we used to have to use
sheets for curtains, socks for washtowels
I was happy as hell when my cousin gave me his hand-me-downs
This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap
This here is serious more Realistic than Radio Shack
Observe as I strike a nerve, reach out and touch my kind
Open up your photo album man, and I bet you find
Folks that passed away, potnahs that been blasted away
I miss you steal some liquor main, who got some tissue

One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love

ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)

Erybody wanna shoot em up bang bang
Way I was raised we had to knuckle up and throw them thangs
We got em up and you know I had to check em swell
Cuz if I ran home and didn't fight back my mom'd beat that tail
Just received word from my folks upstate
They said uh, they tryin ta, they tryin ta take away our weights
And uh, no more beef and pork just muslim books and fish fork
and laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin this
Now I'm bouts ta get married, is it clever
Thought it was, till I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten bucks and got a eight year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry
Man ya out there ballin main can you drop a twenty up in my commisary
Uhh, my family thinks that I'm a thug homie
When you see my momma man give her a hug for me
And tell her

One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)
One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)

Huh, thinkin back, you gotta watch your back and play it well
Enjoyed myself when I was out there tryin ta get in that mail
We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo
Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
That's what we did up under the bridge fools posted up
Choppin game conversatin gettin toast up
Leanin against my seamless convertible tops and boosted cleaners
Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts, actin meanest
The good times, they gone, here in the can is my new phone
Guess in order to do some right I had to do some wrong
Picked up a package yesterday and I was HAPPY
It was a box and full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out ain't seen or heard from Poppa Duke in years
Sent me a picture and some fetti dang they sheadin tears
See first you born then you live then you die
One day soon I'll get another try, one love

One love (one love)                     One love
ohhhh (one love)
One love (one love) well well           One love
well wellll (there's only one love)
One love (one love)                     One love

What a nigga really need to do is sit back and straight stack man
'Cause I've been on this Earth for 3 and some odd months man

Fuck what you talkin' about, throw me that childproof lighter
Oh youse a smoker huh? Then go on and flame
I heard you got some shit and heard it come from Spain

Naw, Amsterdam, I got it from the hemp man
Bought the weed 'cause I love what it do to me
Five o'clock in the traffic and I be fiendin'
Without the bomb nigga life has no meanin'

Okay, see I be krunkin' to profession in American-oh
Cristal Brothers Brandy all down the throat
Steady dippin' call me Funk Master Flex

Got yo' nigga daydreamin', smebbin' in a check-you
Floatin' in a cloud, music up hella loud
Proud to be in the land of the lights and the beer
Got me where I ain't carin'

Because I like what you doin' to me
Because I like what you doin' to me

It's like this and that to fuckin' with your dick on hard
And nigga ain't no Pebble Beach in my backyard
Rackateerin', smearin', no foreseein'

We break bread with the [Incomprehensible], thick ass bitch with the tits
And the anus, off the English, how her body speak her own language
And it's cool when she speakin' to me
I let the hoochie run through me

I seen him walkin' in the rain
I guess the nigga owe too much to the game
They say the nigga used to drive a Mustang
I'm thinkin' potnah musta went against the grain like a lane

Don't trip, a bitch can't do in me
But I be likin' what she doin' to me

Because I like what you doin' to me
Because I like what you doin' to me

Just think, I used to have to flip cabbage
And now I ride in a nine-seven whip Caddy
Meal game, they call me by my stage name
Hella G's when I spit this game

But just think, I used to sell them weights
But now I'm all off into real estates, huh
We put our city on the map, raise clientele
Made it so niggaz can be proud to say they from Vallel'

[Incomprehensible] side, man I went to school with them
Had him in my class, never thought the fool'd pass
But now I took advantage of the opportunity
And I love what it do to me

They say that I got cousins, I ain't never met
Think I'm big-headed, think I'm all that
They say that I don't give to my community
But I be likin' what they doin' to me

Dice game, craps, puffin on Taylors drinkin' Boilermakers
M.D. 20/20 mixed with Boone's, Farm's, and Olde English
Around the clock, deuce-four-seven, three-sixty-fifth
Cause your bass rock butter, that's right twerkin' over shifts
Business boomin off the buzzer, and I'm a happy camper 
Til the homey beat his bootch down for no reason with the Zenith hammer
Thangs started gettin' sloppy, dude started rollin' over
Niggas started steppin on dope and stretchin the crack synthetic yola

Laced down with Trump tight, taught by the best
Some of them still livin', some of them done been put to rest
But I was blessed, and luckily I made it out
But I must confess, I wouldn'ta made it without
The big timers, the top-hats, the tycoons
The street hustlers, the pistol packin' Daniel Boone's
That put it down and paved the way, for me to say
The things I say, and I'm proud to be straight from the Yay
To U.K. I spits this big time talkin' shit all day
Nationwide, from where I stay to where you stay
B like the Savage beast, keep yo' game creased
Stick to the rules and don't be sellin' out to no police
I always paid attention when the game was preached
Had all the street slang and the latest speech
And now I'm makin' more mail than a oil well
Up all night tryin' to get my money orders right

Without a pot to piss in
Used to drive through the turf in them candy paint Benz's

Away for free mayne, whatchu gon' do?

It's like dis, just point out the target
And I'll bet some cash I can't miss
This nigga done started 'cause I got some ass
From his bitch, more broken than hearted
Fool on the hill over this but I'm just as retarded
I act a fool up in this bitch, the reason why she departed
'Cause she was tired of gettin dissed

Dotted and darted all in her eyes like this
But that ain't my business, I keep my game universal
And leave that ol' [unverified] around shit up to them
Squares like Urkel, it's too many lobsters up in the ocean
Big pimps but not enough mobsters breakin' them in
Big pimps tellin' forty, done taught us how to begin
Pull a bitch off the streets and reel her in

To my sable, but everybody ain't able

Took all I can, but I can't take no mo', enough

Got me lookin' like a rainbow

Black eyes, aches and pains, bruises purple and yellow
But I forgive and forget 'cause it's all gravy

I used to fuck for free but now I'm gettin' money lately

Big-ass dookie mayne, big-ass breasts
But the bitch got more miles on her, than SouthWest
You can have that hoe, mayne, but, nigga, please
Is that any kind of broad you want to make yo' main squeeze?
The mental, be timin' and thinkin' hairy

All kind of cracks and crevice

Put 'em on the hoe stroll and make 'em work for mine
Take a mud duck, turn her into gold
Make her sell her ass up in the North Pole
From Lebanon, to Yugoslavia, from Petersberg, to Nova Scotia

I got niggaz in 'Sace suits, trickin' big
Timers in 'gator boots, givin' in justice, corporate executives

And whooped with extension cords?
Did you forget that i was your creation,
And all i wanted from you all was love, hope, and motivation?

Son, you're disrespectful and you're talking back,
Get out my face, kicked me out the house
And wouldn't even let me plead my case.

I'll get the nine

I guess that's the way it is in the life of sin
Where you'll probably end up dead, or in the pen
But my family ain't no better than the next

My auntie brenda turned her own sister in
For writing bad checks
And save folks try to hit you where it hurts

Niggas ain`t smellin this shit

We do this shit
Last night I slapped a bitch upside her dome
With my faulty phone 
That heifer`s tired

She tried to slash my tire
Caught me in the bed with her cousin Tanji
From the track 
She use to hold my sack

I use to dick her down way back in 86
She use to look just like a skank
But now that bitch got a ass, tits, body and boy that bitch is bad
For what it`s worth, the pussy smelled like Certs

Victoria`s Secret
Now folks just remember I never said I thought about lickin pussy 
I said I never thought about eatin
Keepin it and treatin it nice

Fuck that I`m a hog
I put it down, I`m from the hood
Where I live, on the outskirts
And down on the tuck in the cut

In Clemente Apartments man
I`m a baller so you know I ain`t got shit in my name
I`m strictly ghetto celebrity, niggaz get buried
Ready for combat if you plottin and plannin

Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough
Let the buzzer be the bail
But my suggestion is to stay within your envelope
I`m block to block, swingin on vines
Community service, put up stop signs

[Hook]

[Kaveo]
Uhh! Hold the fuck on!!
Did you or did you not tell these niggaz to stay within they envelope?
Shit..., these timers are green to the game
They ain`t know nothin about these tramps

Six bedroom flats and gettin dealt and held a hand across the mat
You see we from the Yay where we control they minds
And put these hoes on the grind

[E-40] 
Ain`t got to but I still touch it
Went to the Seven Eleven picked up a traders book and bought a bucket
Use to have a perm bigger than the Charlotte Hornets
But I had to cut that bitch off cause see your patna had warrant

That I ain`t even handled yet although I`m havin cake
The little homie from the hood want me to put out his tape
He kinda tight too, remind me of The Click crew
'Cause they was spittin that old high powered

Godzilla ballin guru ass type shit you
Can relate to, wake to, `scape to when it`s sunny
Ride by, slide by, get at a honey
I know these streets like I know my dick

I can tell you who the nigga is that`s about to get jacked
And the nigga that pulled the lick
I got this bitch on lock
999,999 plus a dollar in a safe deposit box

Marijuana crops still in this roster
Kilogram, coca leaf and morphien
What about my niggas in the 4-1-5
Look what they made

My niggas in the city 
They call it made
Top grade regeneration, uncut
Designer weed, straight hempilation, what the fuck

Sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit, sheit sheit, sheit...
Hell yeah, sheit!
999,999 plus a dollar, plus a dollar man

Oh! (C'mon, ooh)
Y'all feel that? (I feel it playboy, I smell you)
It's real out here 40 (It's real Pee!)

[E-40]
I'm out here in the slums where thugs be using, ghetto tactics
Like, chopping up candy canes
Sitting on top of a dried up JC Penney day mattress
Whatever it takes to survive, see that's what I supply
Like slipping and sliding in the grocery store
And settling out of court
Soft white coke a black turn into hard solidses
Thirty-eight snub nosed pistol grip lay ninjas on they 
The saga continues, the struggle's just beginning
And it's hard to look up to snotty folks, cause THEY be sinning
'Pac gone, Biggie gone, Seagram gone and we also lost Eazy-E 
One of the first gangster rappers of all time
To the most vicious and deadliest disease in history since cancer
To Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, tombstone
From the graveyard shift, RBL's Mister see
One love, to Rapping Ron and Plan B	
Victims of the trigger 
Po' out a little liquor

[Chorus: x2]
It's not the same, this world is crazy
We out here going through it all
Everything must change, it's getting shady
Got our backs against the wall

[Master P]
I shed tears for pain 40, some for anger
Seen bloodshed by crooked cops, and gang bangers
Feel my pain only time'll change it
And fast money, cars, and bitches got me trapped in this game
And my lil' homies balling, picture me falling
And momma in the funeral screaming and crawling
Is there a heaven or hell?
To ghetto kids in the anky only time will tell
And jealousy, and envy, come with money
While crooked, politicians, run the country
And it's a, damn shame to see my, weeples vanish
Now they teach us ebonics, what about English and spanish
I couldn't, live my life behind bars and gates
While the government play a game called process to eliminate

[Chorus]

[E-40]
Case #246, shooting in an inhabited area
They was steady complaining about the dope selling
But they ain't never been evicted, or convicted
They ain't never been subpoenaed to court, or arrested
Shackled like an animal for pushing rocks
Dang near choked to death by motorcycle cops
Pepper sprayed and laughed at like that shit was funny
Pregnant breezy threw down on her tummy
Do you ever think I'll ever be able to get
A chance to repent and ask the lord for forgiveness
Before he close the casket, will my son end up growing up
Without a father will he end up being a bastard?
A bastard, that's a good question
I don't know, I don't know

A little past ten, roughly about
eleven years old dropped in the good location
My scratch is smellin sour and it's stinkin
got a nigga seriously thinkin
""How can I kill this odor, and purchase me a Lincoln?""
Minimum wage flippin patties - nope
I'd rather fuck around with Coca-Cola, yola
Ice cream, candy, granola, huh
Slave for men - that's what they told me
and I'll break you off somethin suitable
Brought you a key of crack quicker than ?

Why should I wait on a muthafucka to come and get me
When a muthafucka like me can whip back
If so step back, tax a muthafucka hella quickly

Tryin' to hit that patna, dude in the passenger seat
LeSabre, bitch played us, he hate us, bitch made us
It's heinous, he hate us, disobeyed us, hiatus
Underrate us, underpaid us, tried to spray us and erase us
And is on, wonder if it's good or bad karma
So don't try to figure out, try to find out, it's a drought
Maybe that's why everybody walking here 
around with they lips poked out
So if you rook me
From enhancing growl, come and hook me
Buying yellow clusters instead of counterfiet dope
Alexander the Great, macadamia nut, chief rockin' soap
No rebate, no refunds

Money back guarantee my ass
This is the future, that was the past
Sqare ain't nothin' ?bout this game we playa style
Able to smoke weed but you keep on laughin' and smilin
Set your ass up executional style

Two of them ultra-light machine bombers, AR fifteen and Tommy guns
Ready to run into bumbles
Rushin', all I need is a shooter with a Rueger ticket
See the definition of the element of surprise 
is when a nigga least expect it
Retrospect it, It get's hectic (mind's hectic)

he would've saw it comin'
But he didn't, so he's in it, nigga should've went against the grain
See that's the perfect example of the kind of shit

Mannish little knucklehead hard head heathen
Meanin' give a fuck about life I seen my momma
Stab my daddy in the stomach with a knife
When I was three years old, finally figured it out
That's why a nigga sold coke, clientele and clout
Without a motherfuckin' doubt, take a nigga out
For trying to go between my motherfuckin' paper route
Wet his ass up, that nigga see and go

Nigga twerkin', go to several Russian car
Click-ers come esouped with VCR's
Microwave ovens and credit cards
Pullin'' all kind of heavy metal straps
Beatin' nijjas down with bumper jacks
LIP's bitches overseas shoot crap
Try to have more paper than a factory
Motherfuckers gettin' to showin out when the yard flexes
Liable, blow a whole on a psycho
Vital, lookin' out for the rival tribal dead on arrival
Psycho, it's all about survival
Quarter ounce zippers is on
Run up in his home white sock or bone
With the chrome pist-al, pistol whip a nigga
With a zap force, seen this hammer, Arm and Hammer
Bakin soda, listening to the scanner, scared man
Can't win, especially when a nigga packin''
Fetti stackin'', mashin', flashin'

Put the whammy on the whoop, be on the lookout
For the state troop, might shoot, durin the drug deal

Big Willie cashed my hawkin money water so I took it to Scottie's
To keep myself from flashin'
Bought $250 worth of liquor and they tried to charge me

Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop
or a beauty saloon, since he come to be the biggest tycoon
with methamphetamine laughs and heroin balloons

Six po-lice pulled me over laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dopefiend beats
Two white boy groupies, mad as hell
Black men makin mail, couldn't take him to jail

It makes you feel good, like when you bust a nut
Now I'm a millionaire, and can't get enough
Forty tell em how it is (way too tough Short Dawg)

When I first started rappin motherfuckers would cap!
""That nigga fake he sound like Woody Pecker on crack (ha ha ha HA ha)""
Niggaz would laugh and say I rap too fast way back then
But now I be catchin all kind of motherfuckers
tryin to sneak my little old style in

I read an article on you while I was up under the dryin` net

I heard that, okay what`s crackaleezie what`s the heezie deezie?

Why you try to act like you was God`s gift to the world 
A few minutes of a keezie leezie?
All my dentures gathered around to take a look 
At this bankded beauty Dolly Parton gluteus maximus 

Ass big enough to fit a cup on her booty (booty), 
Straight Centerfold Suzette
I`m in the mix (I`m in the mix) check it out
I`m in the mix like a blender

Stay right down the street from Paul from the Diamond Center
I used to cut grass for a livin`
But now I count cash for a livin` (beotch, BEOTCH!) 

[Chorus]

Now, there was a cool little old fuck
Smoked a little broccelius then we stopped by the burrito truck
Stuck, man this shit here`s crazy
I`m in a Ford, Fix Or Repair Daily

Old school antique lifters tickin` 
With a gas leak radiator off the heater reads
I`m in a desperate need of some antifreeze
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit what the fuck`s wrong with this car?

Shit, shit, shit, shit I should`ve drove my Northstar
Dependable, new school get you where you need to be when you need to be
Enemies aimin` at me with they darts
While I`m footin` it, walkin` to Kragens Auto Parts

[Chorus]

A week later, everything was fo` sho`
My album was about to drop so I went on a promotional to`
Bus driver why you cruisin` dude? Where we headed?
Houston Texas, one mo` mile, two mo` exits

Quarter to three me and the Mossie checkin` in at the Doubletree
Lemme call my dudes, who? 8-ball and MJG
Ball where da hoes?
All the hoes be at Poppago`s

Later on that day
Say you know a motherfucker can`t come to Houston 
Without visitin` Little J

I'm in my Fubu drawers, she in her gown
'Cause if some cats tryin' to have at me
I sick the canine in the background
I'm plannin' on splittin' my crown but it ain't gon' be too simple

See I'm a baller, I got bars around the window
Rottweilers, pits, aikietas, doberman pischers tanked up in the yard
With a sign on the fence that reads, ""Warning: Beware Of Dog""
You play the frog if you feel froggish nigga leap

I neglect my dogs, starvin', sometimes they don't eat

I don't give a fuck, how much courage juice you had
Nigga yo' mug don't mean like mine

I bring the noise like a cymbal
I fuck with 40 dem, make you stick your pistol out the window
Bitch, y'all oughta see me at the state fair
Showin' off in front of my broad, tryin' to win my lil' nieces

One of the biggest stuffed animal prizes there
Nicknamed Charlie but my street name is Earl
Ballaholic like Felix Mitchell nephew Lil' Darrell
I know these streets like the Task Force know dope

I am the streets, my ghetto pass can't be revoked
Ten percent, I paid my tithes, forgive me for my sins
Smoke an ounce of weed a day
Maybe that's why I ain't go no ends

You see, you niggaz real truant mayne
Runnin' around here puttin' a black eye in the game
When we tryin' to feed y'all somethin' nutritional for the brain
And nourish yo' game

You see there's two type of niggaz in this world
Those that eat and those that don't
What type of nigga is you, you know? You see we got the tycoon status
Big hogs, tryin to pile the money up out your trash, you dig?

You can call me, Lawry's 'cause I'm seasoned
I eat crevice, but not when it's bleeding
Don't get me wrong, I love sex but I don't play that part
I love Virginia, but not when the Virginia's tart

Toss me good, and I might Dolce and Gabbana it
Gave yo' ass some bread, and let you go buy up some shit

Be on the lookout for the Hillside managler, 40-Water the Ballaholic

I'd rather fly than ride Amtrak
When I'm in Dallas I fuck with [Incomprehensible], and go hard black
Make an opera singer wanna write some raps
Papered up, like who? Like a fax, bitch

I know you didn't say papered up like a fats
Yeah, 'cause we do this shit
Up off the ground on a pitcher's mound
Slidin', to the bad catcher, able to snatch ya

Bat yo' G out the pocket
Run it again with a nigga that's in the socket

Like to fuck a lot mix the business wit' the pleasure
What's up you timer when you gone resign 
Put a soul food restaurant in yo' mamas name and own your own clothing line
Ain't no tellin' 
That's what Harold told Melvin back in the days of penny loafs
When Teddy Pendegrass was in the blue notes
A big lip street nigga was in the makin' a ferocious dangerous dude
A little microscopic seed maranatin' in the fallopian tube
Ready to face the world ready to say my speech
Ready to come out early feet first nigga breeched
Uno uno dos tres quattro
Drinkin' malt liquor out the baby bottle
Five five six six seven eight
Move from the crest side to the hillside
Go ahead ask the vpd
Betcha they tell you about me
Betcha they tell you they been investigatin' my ass since '83
Betcha they say dude real, 
Betcha they say I don't know how that nigga did it 
But he sittin' on a few mill
All I gotta say is nemesis 
Bet I know one thing betch you they know 
Who shot my mommas house up that night on magazine 
Should I say I want to take a face nah
'cause if the district attorney get this tape they might build a case
I'm high as fuck man inhalin' it beatin' on my chest like Tarzan
Hold it fo' ten
Five lucky to be alive
I only got one mo' album to do on jive, an' I'm gone

I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I got mouthpiece
I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I got mouthpiece

Let's go half on a forty an' a twamp sack of broccoli
I got a car deville coupty
So what if it's primer colored so what it's a hooptie
So what if the lifters tick I know I'm forty water 
So what if I gotta get up under the engine an' tap the starter
In the mourning eatin' cereal
Strapped with the 223 infrared material
Who come from nothin' who run the thirteen hundred block
Who used to top have to walk the streets floodin' wit' holes in they socks
Who really real, how many know the deal
Who got they church clothed from the good will
Click shit makes a muthafuckas night
Niggas listen to it 'cause it's right
Money don't make me, I make money
What I look like fuckin' over a broad, playboy I'm a macaroni
I mean that bitch got miles on her she's a ho
I mean that bitch can teach the wind how to blow
She's a pro groupie though
Zulu jocka binaca 
The hood head knocka'

I don't need no iron I'm already creased
I don't need no money I got mouthpiece

Sometimes I'm suited up sometimes I don't care
When I'm grindin' I don't brush my teeth or comb my hair
When I'm timin' I like to buy drinks 
When I'm timin' it's louie the thirteenth
Ballers you know how we livin' 
You know how we meet 'em in the parking lot at Popeye's chicken
I can mesmerize a hoe by jowsin
Can you make a g look like ten thousand
Where all my ghetto tycoon, beanie caps, and kangols
Where all my niggas wit' them federal beepers on they ankles
Where all the hood-hoe dick teasers
Where all my beautiful black intelligent divas

The projects, and the beat down, renovated apartment complexes

Custom painted candy apricot butter
I'm in an antique old school four do'
Muffler draggin beat up duster
With scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars
Y'all get to drink out of wine glasses
We gotta drink out of jelly jars
Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer
Just a pillowcase sack and a bunch of clothes wrapped
In a sheet on our way to the laundrymat
Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cents?
Y'alls got it made, we broke and starvin' barely payin' the rent

Pops tryna beat her down and make her have a miscarriage
My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days
She on that da-ah-diesel, she gone end up wit' AIDS
I told her I love her I swear I just told her

Today my son birthday and I can't even buy a cake
I'm so damn through-a-through, I had a JOB
You want me to cut my perm, oh y'all gone ave to fire me
My fellow just got out da joint, thought he might be okay
But my fellow got out and got stapled 26 times the same damn day
Who wanna get dunked on? In the the flatlands it ain't never too late
Patna all we need is a piece of plywood and a milk carton crate
What about dat shopping basket, you know I'm smart
We can gone take the wheels off that and ma-a-make a go cart

Money tall player, papered up, ghettofabulous
You can ball too pimpin just be about your cabbage

Pistol-whip a bitch with my mouthpiece, paid for hoe
On my car, fuckin lease

I seen hoes capitalize, and hit licks
I wonder what the fuck be wrong with these tricks
So me and 40 singing this song for these tricks
You know them niggas who call them hoes all day
At the hoe job all in the hoe face
As soon as the hoe tip off and get tipsy
She got dick on her lips, up in the Embassy
And be home before four, snuggled up with you 
Wake up and pretend to make love with you

Well I'm at a park, at a club after dark
At a football game, your date in the parking lot
Them hoochies know my name, I'm not a popsicle 
But a fool, can you do the other side of the pimp

Stick and move, all about my uh paper route
When I'm drunk, that's when my true feelings come out
I ain't no punk, you got your easmic stuff
Plus some funk, in real life I'll fuck you up

Raised in the heart of the ghetto, dipping and dodging the metro
Pitching the ? and coke that's what I use to pedal
Heavy metal, a j-jack of all trays
Then you pimp, that's a hustler in many ways

Acting bad in the traffic, the hustler with the package
Serving that cha-cha, that yell, they all tragic magic
Plastic baggage, jelly jars in microwaves
Got to have it, backwoods and purple hayes

Mess around in my side of town, get clowned down
John, Jane Doe, lost and found
Everybody know this young player's about his business
Riches, chickens I pimp, but lickeness

My L.I.P.I folks be digging this

In this occupation you can't be generous

Get your scrilla, be a pimp about it when you on your hustle
Have heart, have money, have muscle
Make sure your L-I-P's be on a rumble

It's like A-B-C's when I spit it
Don't even spot me on the map, 40 did it
When you dead nigga shitted in they bridges
You got a house that's sold out full of bitches

I be the proudest old son of Sick Wid It
Know I'm coming cause I walk with a limp and
Step to the ladder like a playa now I'm pimping
Never gabbles in a hoe and come up with it

Navi cars and a home there's no limit
And I could rock a Prada suit and I feel it
You know I'm bout to buy a bentley in a minute
Fresh off the showroom floor when I spend it

Them playas got more paper than ?keegles? and than some

Talking to they fans drinking Purken and playing Roulette and
Hold up, sweet heart, I'm not done

A be the same dude that cross you and try to get you hit
Cause misery loves company and company loves misery
And money causes jealousy and envy

Well is no one going? No step flowing
With real king news now we all stop joking
Money in my pocket, come try take it
He run up and don't want but if ya want them come get

So lift up ya foot and put it iny ya dancing shoes

(Rich) It's on! (R.R)
(E-40) It's like knick-knack, paddy-whack give a dog a bone

I got a flow so sick it runs a temperature of hundred and one
On the daily, that's why it pays me
And over three billion served, yeah, I'm runnin' this like Mickey D
So drive through
If I let you slide through
Could you funk wit'a nigga wit' a resume
Rich'll never play
And every rapper can't come this way
So when I come bow down
100% I represent the east side of the Oaktown
I throw a boss type of flossy flow
But can you catch it
'Cause when it gets hectic
I'm well respected
And I'm that nigga serverin' tit for tat
Twamp for twamp
From the hills and the valleys into the deep swamps
I leave no stones untouched when I bust
It's strictly mental
As I load all your dope into my rental
And kick yo' ass to the curb
And when you get served
I let you know, Eastside's what I swerve
No I'm comin' up cheap(?), beat after beat
Makin' mail off a known to fluke(??)

[Chorus:]

I'm from the old school, yes indeed
I give my right arm for some good gold(?) weed
I went through a whole lot just to feed the tummy
And I refuse to lose the value money
My shit is real, blunts and phillies
Ain't nuttin' fake like them silicone titties
I'd rather make big bread instead
Regulate, get off in the bitches head
Just like all you toe-up hoes
Niggas want to test my testicles
Nigga you my nigga
If you don't get no damn bigga
Niggas don't want to see me when I'm off that damn liquor
Fo' scheezy, what's wrong wit' yo' pimpin', I gets busy
Bitches love when I'm limpin', 40 watch your roll
That's what they tell me back home, when I be gone, but it be on

You punk, fake inside the paint
In fact I know you can't
Do half of the shit you was claimin' in the county
Suckas on yo' jock
You claim you run the block
Polyurethane busta you cracked in half
Claim you foldin' bank
But I know yo' bank stank
I lived around the corner
I seen you fully smoked
Must I say some moe
You ate a buck `o` four
You sold your TV for a (??) cause it was way too late
And when they sent you up state I heard you gained some weight
So youse a baller, lyin to them youngsters quick
Got 'em thinkin' you sick and representin' yo' click
But youse a old school thinkin too much hype
Yo' bicentenial bike(?) it got ugghh... rally stripes

You'd probably be the victim of a stickin'
You ain't got to lie to kick it

I said bitch, and everybody read my lips 
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O 
And even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow 
I survived 'cause I got mo', game than them 
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps 
It was my destiny, I came the same every time 
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes 

I'm not a freestyler, don't rap for free main

Smack it up flip it, rub it down
Feel so good when you go down town
I like it when you moan and groan and make that sound
I love to see your face when you do that frown
Don't hold back just do yo job
Lick it up and down like corn on the cob
Slob on my knob while yo pussy throb
Gimme head till I'm deader than a fuckin Doorknob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana pealin'
Her throat game platinum worth a million
Put her on a track we can make a killin'
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring big lips and breasts
Extasy, Hennesy
Broccoli, the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
I'm hard like I'm out the penetentary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my niggs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deepthroat contest you and your friends
Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak
Pull it out your mouth now its time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face in your hair all over the sheets

Up and down, in and out,

Slow, dome head, that's the type of shit I'm talkin bout'
Gimme dat, Gimme dat, I'm so glad you into that
If chewin's, what your doin, then you best believe I'm comin back
Black, White, Asian, and Latino don't discriminate
Take it out, take it to the face, then ejaculate
Freaky bitch, nasty bitch my nigg I swear she love this shit
Don't trip pimpin she gon' swallow it if you bust in it
Look into her eyes, she gon' cum, in the process
Have her panties soakin' wet, try to make her choke on it
Deep-throat action hard, dick is what I'm packin'
When she coughin, when she gaggin' she get pimp satisfaction....
Got a nigga weak, in the knees uh
Speakin in another toungue, thank you mama cita

Hustlers, hustlers are us, look out, look out, pimp
",Gouda
E-40,"[female singer - repeat in background]
I'm just happy to be here!

[E-40 over singer]
Hard times, the struggle
The ups and downs, the highs and the lows
You know just goin through it man, ghetto politics
Tryin to make a way out of no way
I was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family
Momma had to work three jobs, oooh

Feet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers
Garage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls
No dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain
Colored folks think that castor oil cures everythang
Pork chops and chicken, we like our food fried
Hypertension, Prenavil pills and hydro-chlorizide
Some of my family still living, some of my family died
Health complications, natural causes and homicide
Just tryin to survive, nothin to lose but plenty to gain
Started hustlin, flea flickin and servin that candy cane
Put all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should
She had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood
While I was in the hood, up to no good
With a hoodie over my head, tryin to outslick the feds
Or should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks
Went from a little a jelly jar up to a soup pot
The fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel
I done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle
I done seen hella people relapse
I done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack
How sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures
Pray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures
Oooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead
God got my back but the devil he want my head

[Chorus: D.D. Artis]
I'm just happy to be here right now
Lot of my folks been locked up or laid down
See I'm sayin I ain't shed no tears, no
But I'm just happy to be here

[E-40]
Listen to this, oooooh
The devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it
Somebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement
Wrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime
Mistaken identity, bullets start flyin
In every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed
But her baby live through a see-section
I know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool
But it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin down a move
We heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same
Our parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang
I be high like an airplane
I be smokin and perkin, takin out anger and stress on the wrong person
Re-uppin and coppin turf an' just servin the soil block
Grittin tryin to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'
Ooooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear
For the homies that never made it and family that ain't here

[Chorus]

[D.D. Artis]
So happy
You know I'm happy to be
Said I'm happy, so happy just to be here
To beeeeeee, to beeeeeeeeeeee
To beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee (I'm so happy)
(Oh I'm so happy)
I'm so happy to be, to beeeeeeee-heeeeeeeeee
To beeeeeeeee (to be here)
",Happy to Be Here

Drank in my cup, blunt in my hand
Hoes on my dick cause they know I'm the man
I'm in the V.I.P. cause I'm very im-por-tant 
Unfortunately I see some niggaz I can't stand (I can't staind)
So I stepped to them suckers and confronted 'em like I should
We can settle this now or we can settle this in the hood

Uhh, so what y'all wanna do? I got a hundred dudes
We got a hundred tools, tryin' to get on somethin' new
You married to the ave and still datin'
I'm loyal to my soil, I don't need no ultimatum
Stop hatin', I ride with my crimeys in crime
I grind with the gritty and grime, let's go!

I'm buyin my yola, you gettin' chronic
I'm tryin' to go out the park, you tryin' to bunt it
So you know if I drop it then it's a hit
The game got it in my grip like a catcher's mitt

My big bills so swoll that I can't even fold 'em up
Big bills so swoll that I can't even fold 'em up
Hold 'em up, who dat is representin' the South
With them diamonds in his mouth, know what I'm talkin' 'bout

Mike Jones, nigga in the streets I'm a king
April 18th I'm droppin' ""The American Dream""
I'm 'bout to shut down the game, my car shut down the lane
E-40, Mike Jones and Ice Age Entertain
Gettin' change, we grippin' grain in the turnin' lane
with a cup full of mud, and a pocket full of change

Mike Jones, I'm sittin' sideways in my dropper
Lookin' out for coppers, checkin' these boppers
Mike Jones, 2-8-1, 3-3-oh
8-zero-zero-fo', holla at me, I got that

[Chorus]

[E-40 - echoes each phrase]
Uhhhh, actin' bad, showin' my ass
Havin' my cash, rappin' fast
Duke of the ave, slangin' them sacks
Like a sack, smokin' grass
Blazin' the block, sellin' that hot
Slickin' the cops, pushin' that rock
Totin' them chops, open up shop
Punchin' the clock, pistols cocked
Havin' my change, drivin' a Range
Switchin' the lanes, hyphy train
Claim to fame, makin' a name
Deep in the game, what set you claim
Doin' it movin, hoes be choosin'
Cause we winnin', and y'all losin'
Big tycoon, drinkin' pukin'
Niggaz' feudin', fightin', shootin'

We're not in love but we pretennnnd

The situation's a win-win (it's a win-win)
We both know we're just fu-ckin (we're fuckin)

[E-40]
Oooh; thick like a big bowl of grits, big tits good looks
I knew you had some good gush gush
Cause you look like you did and I can tell it was bomb (what type)
The type of broad to squirt when she bust a nut and she cum
You said you know I got a man but he ain't treatin me fair
He always gone plus he never take me nowhere
I said what'chu tryin to tell me, he act like you don't exist?
Yup and when he come home he smell like liquor and fish
Fool don't know what he missin, he tardy and lame
But that's his loss, and it's my game
You got a mean throat game and your coochie is serious
Pussy so good I fuck you on your peroid
Naw we ain't in love but we can damn sho' pretend to be
Get a sack of that broccoli and a bottle of Hennessy
Check into a room at the Fairfield Inn (and then what)
Fire up some purple, let the beatings begin (oooh)

[Chorus w/ different ad libs]

[E-40]
Your girlfriends is jealous and sexually frustrated
So of course they hated after you told 'em how I ate it
And you know what they say about fellas with big feet
So why you wanna put my business out in the street?
They already give me extra long hugs and shit (what else)
They want your position, they tryin to scoot you up out of it
Take your foot of the gas, I thought we had an arrangement
You missin the point, it ain't gon' be no engagement
You need to play your position, or you out of the game
You testin my mackin, you out of yo' range
We just fuck-buddies, I'm just stickin and bonin ya
Get somewhere with that dumb shit, stick to the formula
I'll come over later when your kids asleep
And so some nasty things that they gon' have to bleep
Give it to you good, while he out there trickin
Make your man say, ""Girl yo' coo-coo feel different!""

[Chorus w/ different ad libs]

I come through the turf the other day
Why'knahmean they scream out - here for the hemp list

How to spend this dope money, buy some houses and some land
Tryin to teach you niggaz somethin, tryin to lace you like a shoe
Buy a couple of big Celebrities pimpin it ain't gotta be brand new
I'm a boss about my shit, about the way I carry it
The way I wear my glasses low, the way I sport my toothpick
The way I pop it at a hoe, the way I utilize my mouth
The way I keep my fuckin blowover over at a relative's house

Sippin on 40, drink cloud nine, try to get it while it's good
In the heart of the soil, in the middle of the paint, where it ain't
Where we park our cars on the grass, sell hop and push crank
Where the dopefiends dig in our tracks and siphon gas from our tanks
Where the biggest hypocrites in the church call themselves saints
I don't gossip like bitches I mind my own fuckin business
Dig yaper good money cause that sucker shit ain't nutritious
I don't be burnin no bridges I'm a loyalist 'bout my riches

Steady long like a female weave, cooler than antifreeze

But soon as you get mad, she make you cash
That white girl, but she ain't always that light
She ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white

Momma cain't stand her, tellin me to switch

[First verse (E-40)]
Smack it up flip it, rub it down
Feel so good when you go down town
I like it when you moan and groan and make that sound
I love to see your face when you do that frown
Don't hold back just do yo job
Lick it up and down like corn on the cob
Slob on my knob while yo pussy throb
Gimme head till I'm deader than a fuckin Doorknob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana pealin'
Her throat game platinum worth a million
Put her on a track we can make a killin'
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring big lips and breasts
Extasy, Hennesy
Broccoli, the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
I'm hard like I'm out the penetentary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my niggs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deepthroat contest you and your friends
Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak
Pull it out your mouth now its time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face in your hair all over the sheets

[Chorus x2]

[2nd Verse (Al Kapone)]
Up and down, in and out, 
Let me fuck you in yo mouth
Slow, dome head, that's the type of shit I'm talkin bout'
Gimme dat, Gimme dat, I'm so glad you into that
If chewin's, what your doin, then you best believe I'm comin back
Black, White, Asian, and Latino don't discriminate
Take it out, take it to the face, then ejaculate
Freaky bitch, nasty bitch my nigg I swear she love this shit
Don't trip pimpin she gon' swallow it if you bust in it
Look into her eyes, she gon' cum, in the process
Have her panties soakin' wet, try to make her choke on it
Deep-throat action hard, dick is what I'm packin'
When she coughin, when she gaggin' she get pimp satisfaction....
Got a nigga weak, in the knees uh
Speakin in another toungue, thank you mama cita
That's the way you freak her, Papita in her beak uh

If you got the turf crackin' and ya money's stackin', ya
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Leader of the squad and your the team captain
Quaterbackin', Quarterbackin'
Gotta little change and ya drivin' a range
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'
If ya sound system bangs, and ya pushin' them thangs
Quarterbackin', Quarterbackin'

Might not know what I'm talkin' about
If you ain't never lived it, or seen it, or done it
Seen fiends vomit, green stuff I had to clean it up wit' comet
Mean stuff, so many deaths my streets is haunted

Believe us, you shoulda seen us, like Wile E. Coyote, man super genius
Against all odds like Serena and Venus
I only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown
Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone

And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome
It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a lord Jesus perm
When my name was earl before the rap game
Runnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang
Raised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls

[Chorus]

I play the field like Vick, from endzone to endzone
Serve that ish like snowcones in the hood
Entrenched in the gutter, I was lost in the good
'Cause I make the gat stutta like a old G should

Mamas lookin, so much snookin'
Nights in the kitchen thought I'd never finish cookin'
Way before pay for this that I'm mouthin'
19 years young, upward of 80 thousand

Trust me young'n Pusha was never browsin' for nothin' section 8 housin'
I'm stompin' through like King Kong claimin' his home, his jungle
Mumblers beware the hood hates singers
I connect, block the corner like Jenga, fall never, you seen 'em

Posted in the hood leanin' fiends like the Tower of Pisa
Damn he's good..

[Chorus: x2]

Now of course you know I ain't talkin' about sports
I'm talkin' about runnin some shit
I'm talkin' about workestratin' and illustratin'
Glorifyin' ya paper route

Whether it serve it to, uh..
Gettin' out there hustlin', grittin' and grindin'
Doin' ya thug-thizzlemajiggadale

Got a special place in my heart
She knows how to play her part
Every time I look at you darling
I get a hard on
You sexy without your make up on
I wanna bone
Move you out the hood
I told you I would
I'm not phony
We both from the same place
Grew up on fried bologna
They say the opposites attract

Imam fiend when it come to our cooking

Throw down like Paula Dean

We was meant to be
We got chemistry

Been around each other so long

Starting to think a like

From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, ""40 Water, I just wanna be on""

I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

Being teeded in your chest get you stinging and itching
Got to have the right ingredients before you can start
Like 1 part gangsterism 1 part heart
2 parts of keeping it G and add you 100 milligrams of a killer man and you'd had done it
Put it all inside a Cadillac with them 3's and them 4's
Swing wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues
Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity
Now you done made you a trill nigga
Now that's the recipe

They she her brain is in her ass but she really smart
All about her cash never been a mark
Raise in the trap seen a whole lot
Gluteus maximums shape like a heart
Legs spread apart
Trying to go to Clark
Looking for the light
But always find dark
Some of my folks like tricking
Some of my folks like pimping
Some of my folks spit rap
Some of my folks pitch crack
Give you a tycoon shower
Without the shower cap
I got the money and the power
Sprinkle you a stack
There she go sliding down the pole
One dollar bills coming out her asshole

[Too Short]
There she go
Down the pole

If he finds out she'll be in trouble
But if he don't her money doubles
Everyday she goes to work
Put her on stage they go berserk
I'm way in the back blowing purp
You throwing cash in the air
You suppose to flirt
She come out them draws ass everywhere
Don't keep her all night
Pass her player
Cause she's my favorite yes she is
I wanna see her dance naked
She the best in the biz
Bitch!

Bigger than all outdoors
She got booty galore
Ass like I?ve never seen before

She picking up her money off the floor
Its crazy all the ballers in the club know
I called the crib told my broad I ain't coming back home
I den found another chick I wanna bone

[Too Short]
They call me short
I'm nothing nice
Been hanging out in clubs all my life
Seen a wild ass stripper
Hair was bushy
Upside down with a bear in her pussy
Lay up on the pole she can sit on a roof
Slid back down she was getting it loose

What can I do for ya
Looking for that China white
Girl that's soft

If I ain't got it
I know where to find it
If I can get it for you
Boss

How much you got in your budget
The more you buy the less it costs
I could front you a few off the side
As long as your ass don't double cross

You crossed a lot of raccoons
Get your cranium sawed off
I got mouths to feed my nigga
I can't afford to take no loss

I can give your ass a number
It's up to you to keep it quite
You can't be a punk about nothing
You gotta keep the money coming

I'm out here
Dealing with these suckers
Stopping the fake ass
Busters

They stab your ass in the back
These brothers turn on you
I know when it's gonna get short
How long this sureness suppose to last
I ain't got the weather channel
To predict the forecast

The plan is hustling
?cause there ain't no work there ain't no job
So they stuck in playing this game
And the next thing they gonna rob

Two faced little ol' heathen
Working with the law

Man no matter what you do for nigga
They ain't never gonna be satisfied
Tell it like it is
My whole thing is like
Why dudes be letting cats get in their ear though
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't know what the fuck happened between '96 up into now
Nigga is hoes
I'ma tell it like it is
Man nigga is going out backwards man
Kill all this snitching my nigg what's up with that
Tell it like it is

If there was a snake it would've bite ya
See you've been fallowing so many nigga you wouldn't even know what hit ya
Now you don't know which way to look
You don't really know which way to turn

Got you trying to protect yourself
With all the bridges you done burned

You nigga cry to us nowadays
Nigga feelings get hurt too easily
Might as well wear a tampon
Might as well be a breezy

A closed mouth don't get fed
And a lazy hustler don't get bread
Pimping I can't read minds
I don't know what's in your head

Everybody think they know it all
Wanna hear nobody speak
Shut the fuck up and listen sometime
Even if you an O.G.

Personally I'm a grinder
Let no grass grow under my feet
Don't nothing come to a sleeper
But a dream

A vision without a plan
Is just a hallucination

I gotta lotta folks in the pen
Programming
I'm gonna give it to you straight
I ain't gonna give it to you late
I'ma tell your ass what's real
I ain't gonna tell ya nothing fake

Man I got my own dreams
Everybody wants me to finance theirs
Tell it like it is
You know who I like I like that boy 40 man
He's 20 years in the game and he consistent
Just telling it like it is
Not all of them but allot of these new dudes is
Ring tone rappers man
I'ma tell it like it is
Fools just have one album out
And act like they just it
Tell it like it is

Same song third verse
It's from the heart it ain't rehearsed
The world is full of associates
But very few friends
That wanna contribute nothing
But wanna help spend your ends

Think before you rock yo mouth
Park your tongue and lip
Watching who you talking round
Never know who you?re having dinner with

Ain't got nothing good to say
Don?t say nothing at all
That's what I was told
That's what I was taught when I was small

A lot of theses so called artists got too much
Talent
You should be getting? your money on
Instead of hating on the next man

It's lonely at the top
But it's next to crowed at the bottom
That's why I always keep my pistol cocked
In case I gotta stop 'em

Trunk full of slap
Hollering at em? back

Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks

I'm old school
Acting a fool making my presence known
I look at business face to face
Don't like to talk on phones

When I'm at a stop sign or a red light
I leave one car space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so I could have enough room to get outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
That's how I was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby
I'ma tell it like it is
Man I was hollering at my grand partner
He said 40 return phone calls and you'll keep your friends
Tell it like it is

I'm trying to wake it up, I'm on your line like Vonage
I'm a real one, Ma!
Get rid of that clown, Get with a factor
Patna don't count, he a lame he don't matter
Shining like a big dipper, glowing like a star
Looking up a paw, pulling up in my car
Walked right up to the front where the bosses park at
I got a cold mouth piece can talk a chick out her check
Security loves me, let me in with no sweat
I see Asian persuasion, Caucasian, all kinds of chicks
Milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and Haitians
Tryna take me something home and have some relation

What you holding? Girl you a banger!
You ain't off the back porch, you're off the hanger!
You working with something, you gotta personal trainer?
Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind
You a ten piece, shawty you a dime
Back that thing up, baby press rewind
I'm a Scorpio, Shawty what's your sign?
I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation
Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin'
Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up
I'm a show you how a tycoon wake that thing up

[Bridge: Akon]
Don't stop get it get it, Bout' to jump up all the way up in it
Love the way you drop low and bend it
Girl you're killing me, wait a minute
Love the way that you shake it up
Too natural to make it up
Won't be long till we wake it up

'Cause I'm so serious, 
You get it in the morning
'Cause I'm so serious

You gonna bounce back if you got get back skills
Fuck all that weeping and whining and crying piss on a bitch
I'ma make it do what it do get out and get my grits
I'm on that graveyard shift my water feel pass me
Hustlin' tryin' to stay focused got a twenty four hour notice on my door
Business is slow, I speak the truth will pressure out the roof
A long way from being recession proof
I'm going through
I ain't trying to be a deadbeat dad 
I want my kids to have a better life than I had
My cellular off, need some more minutes over my limit
Had the money but bought ounce of weed thought I could flip it
Man I'm niggorant 'cause that's what some of us black folks do
Instead of payin' a bill we gonna buy the new Jordan shoe
Milk and diapers and baby wipes cost an arm and a leg
A breast of wing and a thigh
Hustle trying to get by

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back

Don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me

I'm sick of this sequel
Man I swear I hate reportin' to them people bra' I'm down on my luck
Ain't got a buck to my name, dirty testing pissing in a cup, what the fuck
They found weed in my system, I told my girl I was quitting
They sent me back to San Quentin for ninety days
Did my time and got out, 
Now I'm in the unemployment line trying to figure shit out
But the penal system got me by the necks haha
With my troubled past I can't even get me a job
My partner rap he got his own record label they doing their thang
If I holler at him maybe he can shoot me some change
Plus I'm a loyal nigger man, I learn quick bro I ain't stupid
All you gotta do is show me one time and I can do it
My fellow put a hustle under his wang, show me the game
Now I'm doing my thang

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that

I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple 
This little change that I got
By throwing a few concerts
But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this mill' 
The reason why is rap shows don't always go that well
Uh, and the chances are that I probably won't recoup
So I'ma take this loot and book some old school R'n'B soul groups
That way the value insurance won't be that high
And plus I'm minimizing the chances of somebody dying, that's right
I got a homie that work at the toll bridge
He make good money, plus he get benefits
He been hollering at me never the lesson
Trying to get a nigger a job there which is a blessing
But I don't think the homie really understand
I am an entrepreneur man I ain't working for no white man
Attitude of a hood boy, all my life I've been running from the Elorys I'm serious

Hey don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that
I drop it off and it come right back
I get it in the morning
Don't underestimate me,
A couple of days is all is gonna take me
'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that

Top convertibles, Benzs and Jags
Smoking me herbal, sipping me wine,
Or should I say turbo 'cause it's green and it's lime

When he took his first step, he walked with a limp
Man this nigga hard headed damn fool
His teacher sucked his dick in high school
Supercalifragilistic ex be ala hooligan
Breakin down the diesel mixing cookies with the headband
Went to jail on a Friday, didn't get out till Tuesday
Got a DUI for drinking too much lou, bitch

Insurance, is going up, and when I go to court I know I'm fucked
All this shit, just for drinking
Need a designated driver, I'm to drunk for thinking
Two hands on the steering wheel
Don't let a friend drink and drive if you being real
Might crash the whip, might lose your life
If I get too high tonight just make sure
I making home safe and you do the same
Now let's get fucked up and lose it man, bitch

And ever meal got a waiter with it
And I'm all about pour drank up
While I'm rolling the stank up
Sweat my wife out her make up,
Blow a pound when I wake up,
See the cars they don't wanna race us
I do it big niggas do it A Cup
Walk up in the club then gonna bring some champagne
I'm a blow a lot of drugs, I put money on it,
Spendin all this bank let a fuck nigga hate

And it don't stop, and it don't quit
And it don't stop, hell yeah
And it don't quit, and it don't stop
Fool we don't quit
You've entered the wild wild west
Side, high noon clock strikes twelve that's high
I see haters trespassin' in my town
They must be sick in the head
They better be quick like Sharon Stone
And quicken their dead and quick on the draw
Western winds make the dirt gust
I still see you when you hear strikes I'ma bust
It's on, I've been holdin it down for years
Don't follow nobodies shadow (none)
A true desperado
21 guns salute when I come through
Why you sell a million copies sounds like your crew
I roll like no man, follow no man
Spittin wicked over tracks, me and see programmed
Hard, I keep comin raw, 'cause I'm hungry 
Don't sweat the industry 'cause no company are gonna own me 
That's why I stand my own ground 
and square off who ever want's to throw it down 
I bring it to the showdown

Chorus [Montell Jordan]
Follow me into the world of Mr Ski (Yeah)
Ain't gonna be no mystery 
Who's gonna win this show's showdown (You know)
Run inside Ski's goin on a lyrical ride (Yeah)
It's gonna take a miracle why ask why 
Ski's gonna win this show's showdown

Verse 2 [E A Ski]
I'm a producer so they thought I would drop a compilation
Makin hard tracks spittin no conversation 
Look here, ain't no rapper feelin conversate for me 
And take it away from catitalles compersatin me 
Only my true dogs call me E A Ski punk
So when you acknowledge me put the mister in the front 
Spell it right, M-I-S-T-E-are Ski 
Composin gangsta tracks with mister see since eighty-three
You proberly heard me on Friday with Cube and Chris Tucker
Blast, I break a slow dog runnin for cover
How would I sound makin tracks if I couldn't rap
Bompin them so hard, my dogs give me def wounds
I'm wanted in four cities, Miami, New York, L.A. and Oakland 
With leavin the mic court smokin
Kick open the door, at the saloon 
Don't nobody move unless they want to throw down, here at the showdown

Chorus [Montell Jordan]
Follow mw into the world of Mr Ski
Ain't gonna be no mystery
Who's gonna win this show
You can run inside side, Ski goin on a lyrical ride
It's gonna take a miracle, why ask why 
Ski's gonna win this show's showdown

Verse 3 [E A Ski]
I told ya I'm gonna keep squeezin until they quit
Distribution heard quick got the whole ghetto lootin
The moms and pops and retails hear Ski puttin in work
Pull up on the block bompin it hurts (Why)
Makin ya whole hood feel me like grill
And have your whole city high ride like George Steel
Fool you want the funk, we can bring it to the stage 
Face off like John Travltra and Nicolas Cage 
A lot of rappers calm east Oakland ain't frontin
Put them lyrically toe to toe to me and see who really run it 
And we haven't even gotta talk about the production tip 'cause on the real
None of them gonna quit
To handle my calibre this next level style combined me rhyme 
Groups want to need a click why don't they come to mine 
You can escape the infra red but it's on ya 
You best best hit a couple of corners 
Bring it to the, showdown

Cause I know that you miss me

I dreamed of you
In so many lonely nights
With my body and soul
And I know you were
Out there in the city lights
Just out of control

Hey I walked around and all I found
Was me myself just losing ground
I missed you, but I walked on thin ice
Like a clown in disguise
All the time there was your face
You only you can end the race
Love me, in the heat of the night

And search for the honey pot

E-Rotic,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All
