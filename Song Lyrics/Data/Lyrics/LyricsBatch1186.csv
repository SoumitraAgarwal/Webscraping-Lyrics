Steve Goodman,"Oh, grandpa wore his suit to dinner
Nearly every day
No particular reason
He just dressed that way

Brown necktie and a matching vest
Both his wingtip shoes
He built a closet on our back porch
And put a penny in a burned-out fuse

Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses, stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower 'cause Lincoln won the war

Well, he used to sing me ""Blood On The Saddle""
And rock me on his knee
And let me listen to the radio
Before we got T.V.

Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday
And he'd take me with him too!
Stained glass in every window
Hearing aids in every pew

Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses, stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
He voted for Eisenhower 'cause Lincoln won the war

Now my grandma was a teacher
Went to school in Bowling Green
Traded in a milking cow
For a Singer sewing machine

Well, she called her husband ""Mister""
And walked real tall and proud
And used to buy me comic books
After grandpa died

Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses, stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower 'cause Lincoln won the war",Grandpa Was a Carpenter
Steve Grand,"Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Carve you out a hollow bed of quiet
Let me knead your heart back to healthy blindness
Where it used to be
Baby, it was you and me

Be my shield, I will be your soldier
Waging war for love
It's an art just staying sober
While piece by piece
This swollen heart just swallows me

Maybe we just give it some time?
Oh, oh you gotta let me give it a try
And now my friends keep telling me to get help
I hardly recognize myself

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

And have no doubt, I never meant to hurt you
Babe, it's over now
You know I didn't mean to undermine our trust
Leave us in a cloud of dust

Maybe we just give it some time?
Oh, oh you gotta let me give it a try
And, yeah, I know I really need to get help
Cause, babe, I can't control myself

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Tell me that you want it
I already got it
Tell me that you want it
Mmm mmm mmm

Tell me that you want it
I already got it
Tell me that you, that you, that you

I'm all red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

I said red, white and blue
My heart's a mess, I'm busted up for you
You twist the knife so deep
The pleasure and the pain cuts me 'til I bleed

This brand new man I will become
I am born again, right out this skin
I only live to start again
So I run

24, I’m not so sure

I mean no disrespect, I just don’t give a shit

I’ve shuddered at the pain I’ve caused
I crossed that line, no good at lies
I looked the devil in the eyes

Steve Green,"All creation has a language
Words to say what must be said
All day long the heavens whisper
Signing word in scarlet red
Amber rays and crimson rainbows
Twinkling stars and flashing light
Punctuate the heavens' statement:
""God is glorious, perfect, right
God is glorious, perfect, right""

All day long the sun proclaims it
Like a Bridegroom dressed in white
Coming from His tent to greet them
All His guests feel His delight
Words of love and warmth He whispers
Warning all who hear His voice
""Oh, be glad and share My table
Dance and celebrate, rejoice!
Dance and celebrate, rejoice!""

All creation sings His praises
Earth and heaven praise His name
All who live come join the chorus
Find the words His love proclaim

Steve Herberman,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Steve Herberman,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Steve Hill,"JUNGLE
(Steve Hill)
 
I'm lost in the jungle...not really minding at all.
Just one thing bothers me, how did I get here?
When you're in the jungle, what do you do for fun?
Dance with an antelope ...I doubt it.
 
Sleepless creatures and their families...look at me with thought-filled eyes
Plants and reptiles knowing things I'll never know.
 
Bridge:
Just who is that beast? Tell us what he wants!
Doesn't have much hair...neither back nor front,
Could he be a tree? Not without some bark.
Maybe he's a friend, friend of the aardvark.
 
[Instrumental  Break]
 
Just who is that beast? What was that he said?
Not what you'd expect... from a quadruped.
Doesn't trill his tongue...like a jungle fowl.
Doesn't have the smell...of the wolf that howls.
 
When I think about it...crocodiles aren't all that crude
Even though they don't know how I got here.
I'm trapped in delusion, lost in a kingdom of dreams.
Could this be serious? ...I doubt it.

Diridiri, dirididi Daddy 
Go 

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote 
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY) 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome 
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh) 

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah) 

Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

Steve Hillage,"It's all too much, It's all too much

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much...It's too much

Too much too much too much (fade to end)",It's All Too Much
Steve Hillage,"I'm walking on the land
But my mind is under the sea
The fish in the sky just swim on by
And the birds in my brain keep on singing
The trees keep growing
And the seeds are sowing beneath the ether
It's time for my soul to go

Swimming inside Nature
Diving through the flowers
Popping out at the bottom of the sea
In minutes that seem like hours

I want you to come with me
Journeying with your mind

We'll learn to feel the divas
And feed them with our vibes
Hear the music of the spheres
Through the ears of the cauliflowers
And the living grass that breathes

I want you to come with me
Journeying with your mind

So let's dive below the waves of words
And sink beneath the turbulence
And leave the restless images behind us
And touch the secret power of nature
Under the sea

Way down
Way down
Way down below the ocean
We'll be riding our emotion

Way down below the ocean
We'll be riding our emotion",Sea Nature
Steve Hillage,"It's getting better all the time 
I used to get mad at my school 
The teacher's that taught me weren't cool 
You're holding me down 
Filling me up with your rules 

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine 

Me used to be angry young man 
Me hiding me head in the sand 
You gave me the word 
I finally heard 
I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better 

I used to be cruel to my woman 
I beat her and kept apart from the things that she loved 
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene 
And I'm doing the best that I can 

I admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
Yes I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine...",Getting Better
Steve Hobbs,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Steve Hobbs,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Steve Hobbs,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Steve Hobbs,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweeter than the roses in May

And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Steve Hogarth,"Leo drives his Mustang along ocean Boulevard
He works hard for his money
Spent it all on his car
Rents a one-room apartment that no one's ever seen
But he makes love on the back seat
To the girl of his dreams

She wears high heels and Lycra
Shows off her curves
She did aerobics and surgery
Keep 'em well preserved

She thinks, this guy, Leo
Seems like he's got it all
He's got a job in the business
He says he'll make a few calls

He's got friends in high places
All he has to do is phone
She bites her lips as he takes her
He makes love like he's alone

Break the bad news to the angel in the morning
He takes the car to the car wash
When the shine goes away
He leaves her smudge-eyed and stranded
It's a beautiful day....

There's a man in the valley
He met on Ocean Way
He's got everything Leo dreams
He's got a yacht in the bay

Leo drives down to see him
With an idea or two

'Could make him big in the business
Turn the lies into truths

But the car don't mean nothin
Cause the man's worldly wise
He sees the white teeth and the sun tan
With nobody inside

I'm a guest of this city
I'm by the pool on the roof
Poolside is pretty
You can feel the earth move...

This is a town full of Leos
The sun shines on the cars
And the buses of tourists do the homes of the stars

'Hotel California' goes around in my head
And the folks who are loaded keep a gun by the bed
But you can't help but notice....
The poor wind up dead.

And the kids on the east side watch the cars going by

Steve Hogarth,"Nothing fell into the cage today
That's fastened to my door
I put the cage upon the door in case
You send your private thoughts to me
I know I have no right to be
The one to whom you might
I know I have no right
The little black brushes keep out the cold
And the inquiring eyes
Nothing slid it's way between them
My fantasies are painful now
Unnatural .. or so I'm told
I know I have no right to be forgiven for the tears
I'm getting through the day somehow
What will I do about the years
And I say...
DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS
Someone else can do that, darlin'
You don't need them animals
Throw me something please
I'm starving
Do not feed the animals
Someone else can do that, angel

Steve Hogarth,"You are the deep water
You are the thin ice
The edge of the high cliff
And the November fires
You are my church bells
And the silent early hours
You are the ghost I hear
Echo in the half-light
Ecstasy and heart failure
Trembling and pounding in the magic spell
You are my wild flower and my wishing well
The spinning cut crystal above my bed
that dazzles and jabs me
Indigo blue and postbox red
I run away and away and away from you and everyone
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
I make believe I make excuses I make fun
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
Oh my love
I know what I am
A lost cause
Selfish beyond forgiveness

Knows what I am
A lost cause

Steve Hogarth,"I have an animal inside me
He sleeps during the day
But he kicks and ticks even when he's sleeping
Never completely goes away
And as the evening shadows stretch themselves
The animal begins to wake
Comes out to see what is for breakfast
He takes whatever he can take
He isn't murderous or wicked
Sometimes he's like a little child
But he's voracious and insatiable
He's self-destructive and he's wild
I sometimes think about the animal
Sometimes I'm proud, Sometimes ashamed
I know he drove me from my hometown
Made me feel like I'm not the same
I know he stops me being boring
I think so anyway
And I don't know if I control him
But I must try to keep him chained
But he doesn't think about the future
He lives completely in the NOW
Doo bee doo bee dooo...
I sometimes see the other animals
Controlling other peoples lives
Doing things they thought they'd never do
And not really knowing why
So we must all beg for forgiveness
Say sorry and explain
Until the evening shadows stretch themselves
And here we go again...",The Evening Shadows
Steve Hogarth,"A hundred thousand hearts a day
Are vacuumed in along these runways
In specks of iron from around the world
Drawn to the magnetism in this place
I've watched them land in the Heathrow haze
Through 'Nothing to Declare' into cars that speed away

I'm watching the aeroplanes comin' in
Waiting for a miracle
Watching the aeroplanes comin' in
Wonderin' if I'll see you again
Wonder if I'll see you again

I understand how you had to leave
You said 'back soon' and I must believe
My feelings haven't changed since that fateful day
You left me grounded and you flew away

Over my house into the clouds
To foreign lands in the sunshine
I watch the seven forty sevens climb
Over my house into the clouds
To foreign lands in the sunshine

I wave bye bye, bye bye,
A hundred thousand hearts a day
Come gliding down but they don't explain
An empty seat on a sold out flight
A year ago on an empty night
I watched you down but you never came
Through 'Nothing to Declare' like a sign hangin' on my name

If I knew what you are really like
Would I burn the same
Would I yearn at the merest mention of your name
If I knew

Would I think about you every second just the same
Or would I write it off as something of a terrible mistake...
Could you really be
As perfect as you are to me
Could you really be
As perfect as you are to me
Would I be scared, Would I be in awe
If I could know
What goes on in that little mind of yours
When I doubt you
Why is it I'm expected to feel so ashamed
Is it a garden full of flowers
Or a jungle full of scorpions and snakes
A cellar full of demons
A heaven full of angels
You hatchin in that bosom
A wide open horizon
or a desert plain
A box of nice surprises
Or a cauldron full of pain
If I strip away that outer skin
Find a way to get you drunk
What kind of picture would you paint me
Michelangelo or Munch ?
Could you really be
As perfect as you are to me
Could you really be

Catch my soul, catch the very night
Hide the moment from my eager eyes
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Long winters longer than time can remember

The proud sons and daughters 
That in the knowledge of the land 
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Lose as much as only you can show
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What I don't know, I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the fact there shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show if you and you may follow

Steve Howe,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Close To The Edge

I. The Solid Time Of Change
Anderson/Howe

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace,
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.
And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,
And take away the plain in which we move,
And choose the course you're running.

Down at the edge, round by the corner,
Not right away, not right away.
Close to the edge, down by a river,
Not right away, not right away.

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,
Reaching to call the color of the sky.
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.
Getting over all the time I had to worry,
Leaving all the changes far from far behind.
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name.

Down at the end, round by the corner.
Close to the edge, just by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.
Now that it's all over and done,
Now that you find, now that you're whole.

II. Total Mass Retain
Anderson/Squire

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand.

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,
As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be.

Down at the edge, close by a river.
Close to the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by the corner.
Down at the edge, round by the river.

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.
All in all, the journey takes you all the way.
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain.

Down at the edge, round by the corner.
Close to the end, down by a river.
Seasons will pass you by.
I get up, I get down.

III. I Get Up, I Get Down
Anderson/Howe

In her white lace
You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain.

I get up, I get down,
I get up, I get down.
Two million people barely satisfy.
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.
The eyes of honesty can achieve.
How many millions do we deceive each day?

[Thru the duty she would coil their said
Amusement of her story asking only interest
Could be laid upon the children of her domain]

I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

In charge of who is there in charge of me.
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
The truth is written all along the page.
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.

IV. Seasons Of Man
Anderson/Howe

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.
As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.
Ah, ah.

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,
Called to witness cycles only of the past.
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark.

Close to the edge, down by the river.
Down at the end, round by the corner.
Seasons will pass you by,
Now that it's all over and done,
Called to the seed, right to the sun.
Now that you find, now that you're whole.
Seasons will pass you by,
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.
I get up, I get down.


And You And I

I. Cord Of Life
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,
A movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.
Between the picture of time behind the face of need,
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.
Oh.

Coins and crosses

Turn round tailor, assaulting

Never know their fruitless worth;

all the mornings of the interest shown,

presenting one another to the cord,

Cords are broken,

All left dying, rediscovered

Of the door that turned round,

Locked inside the mother earth.

To close the cover, all the

interest shown,

They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,

To turn one another, to the sign at the time float your climb.

Watching the world, watching all of the world,

Watching us go by.

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,
And you and I reached out for reasons to call.

II. Eclipse
Anderson/Bruford/Squire

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
As a movement regained and regarded both the same,
All complete in the side of seeds of life with you.

III. The Preacher the Teacher
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;
Political ends, as sad remains, will die.
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
Ooh, ooh.

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me.
The preacher trained in all to lose his name;
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.
In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,
As a moment regained and regarded both the same,
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you.

IV. Apocalypse
Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.
And you and I reach over the sun for the river.
And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.


Siberian Khatru
Anderson/Howe/Wakeman

Sing, bird of prey;
Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man
As they regard the summit.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right on over my head.

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.
Cold reigning king,
Hold all the secrets from you
As they produce the movement.

Even Siberia goes through the motions.
Hold out and hold up;
Hold down the window.

Outbound, river,

Hold out the morning that comes into view.

Bluetail, tailfly.

River running right over the outboard, river,
Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time.
Dude'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

Hold down the window;
Hold out the morning that comes into view.
Warm side, the tower;
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru.

Gold stainless nail,
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit.
Cold reigning king,
Shelter the women that sing
As they produce the movement.
River running right on over my head

Outboard, river.

Bluetail, tailfly,
Luther, in time,
Suntower, asking,
Cover, lover,
June cast, moon fast,
As one changes,
Heart gold, leaver,
Soul mark, mover,
Christian, changer,
Called out, saviour,
Moon gate, climber,
Turn round, glider.

Steve Hunter,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I wonder if you care care about me

I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you

Steve Jordan,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Bought me a daiquiri, told me meet her in back of Zachary's

I bagged the freak
And hit the tele, got the phillies, lifted her belly
And put it in her mouth like Akinyele
Far from ugly 
But they used to say I'm too chubby, but since the money
The honies got nuthin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish
I'll make you rich, take your kids to the flicks 
Come back and fix your favorite dish
Crazy bitch
I ain't with that, I'mma hit that, split back to the shack

Making you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the hip-hop quotables
Giving you multiples, just by the tone 
Of my voice and the vocables

With your crew, is it aight if I come down there 
And sing to you

There's something that I've got to confess
Me and the boys went looking for some trouble

Someone started tooting and then we started shooting

Waiting for some service, taking in the air
My life spins past
As I'm thinking of you
The waitress comes up I look her in the face
Say ""bring me something fit for the human race""
She doesn't hear a word
She looks right through


Like a ghost (take a look before I melt away)
Like a ghost (take a look before I melt away)


Twelve o'clock when the wine runs out
Go out on the balcony, hear someone shout
I look below
Is that my body on the street
Check the mirror, nobody home
I can't find a razor, can't find a comb
We've got to have a talk
'cause you're dressed in a sheet


Well I really start to worry when I stand in the queue
It's starting to pour and I don't know what to do
Funny thing is
That I don't get wet
I hail a cab but he sails out of sight
What's my name, what's my age, what am I doing in this night
These questions and answers
I try but I forget
",Like a Ghost
Steve Kilbey,"Well I came to this land where the snow and the sand
Cover my footprints with ice
The cool gray sea calls me ""come and be free""
And I almost take that advice
And in the night I cling to the names
Of the women I wanted and the men that I blamed
And their scorn that scorches my tracks
One thing I know you can never come back
Oh darling please meet me in the dark empty streets
Won't you bring me the things that I need
No-one is waiting where she used to stand
Just the jagged thorns of the weed
And in the day they drink their hot wine
And I long for the things that can never be mine
So your pretty clothes do not unpack
As plain as the day you can never come back

Won't you give me some bloodlike guarantee
I've been listening to myself too long
And they're making a prophet out of me
I'm as empty as a shell can ever be
I've been walking through the desert
No it must have been the library
Reading a book which once gave me hope
Now it's making a fool out of me
I'm as empty as a shell can ever be
Lazy dreaming, half remembering, half remarking to myself
Never noticed that the crowds were leaving
Never looked for anyone else
Now it's market day almost every day
Yet they give away their love for free
I'm just waiting for a ship to come
And it's making a slave out of me
I'm as empty as a shell can ever be

Never noticed that the crowds were leaving
Never looked for anyone else

From the top of samir
Or even hermon
From the lairs of lions
From the mouths of leopards

Oh my sister, my bride
You have made my heart beat
By one of your eyes
By just one pendant of your necklace
Open to me, oh my sister, my girl companion
For my head is filled with the dew
The locks of my hair with the drops of the night
I've put off my robe, how can I put it back on
I've washed my feet, how can I soil them
I am asleep, but my heart is awake
To the sound of knocking, my dear one knocking

Liquid, she's drinking more of everything

She drained an ocean out of me
Left me washed up in bankruptcy
Like a storm far out to sea, she's gone

She ran like water through my hands
Silver drops on thirsty lands
Then she sank into the sand, she's gone

Stranded on a saw-toothed reef
She bled my life beyond belief
Just another fluid thief, she's gone

Sometimes I think of the lives I could have led
Before the sweet nectar, heat and lust came shimmering out of my head
In a salty cave I perspire pure oblivion
A sexual dimension, of black and vermilion
She said I'm drowning, in the voice of an alien
There was no life for me
Sometimes I plan the revenge I will sustain
The rapture of the deep, rivers and rain
We swam through the channels of an underground cleft
I couldn't keep going, I was losing my breath
Woozy with fever, catching my death
There was no cure for me
Sometimes I remember the blue island skies
Well I was seeing the world through enchanted eyes
Coral cut my fingers, my blood tasted good
She dived in and drank more than she should
Left me drifting like driftwood
There was no hope for me
Sometimes I hear the birds, the crash of the waves
Across the black lake where the fisherman slaves
Electric eels, in translucent coils
The lava erupts and the green ocean boils
Taking her bait, burning my oils
There was no stopping me",Liquid

The crooked fox, he worships her:
Cut off an infidel's finger
Just to steal the wedding ring
And give it to the singer.

He wants her for his slave.

In the bloody chamber
About the mad tiger
He licks the skin off of women.

I could wear those stripes (straps ? !) for you.

With the symbols and incense
To both krishna and buddha
And the goddess of fortune
For an indian lover
To wake kundalini
Your beautiful yonni
But also iscariot
Who comes to betray us
With just one english kiss.

Deep in the autumn
I lie in my bedroom
Just one more long shadow
Fall into the corners
I reach for a woman
Who harbors in darkness
She lands on a mountain
Sways for a moment
Crashes in pieces all over my eyes.
All over my eyes

And when you get tired
Of fake little evenings
Slip through your fingers
And don't keep their promise.
Such a sad vision
It breaks up my daydream
Such a sad vision, breaks up my daydream

Look up that sleeve, where is the rabbit
Already secreted along with the dove
Where is the passion, already depleted
Just like the love.

Can you imagine what I can manage
With your permission, with your consent.
I know what you're thinking
Hear what you're saying, how could I ever?
I know what you like.
I think I know what you like.

You should give it some thought

I met miss linda wong, she was looking for me
She led me to her bedroom
Wonderful things she said
Too much for my head, like I'm all at sea

Her bones shone through her skin
Her eyes were green and tin (? ),
She floated in the wind,
The wind from the sea
Her arms were thin and scarred,
Her face was young and hard
But her mind was a garden, open for me
If I stay here too much longer
Much have needed something stronger
I never would belong her
World was not mine
Together we've float and drift
On what we smoked and sniffed
Press a button on the lift, for cloud 9

Her bones shone through her skin
Her eyes were green and tin (? )
She floated in the wind
The wind from the sea
Her pale chinese cheeks
Ain't seen the sun for weeks,
That ain't the life she seeks

But how, when it's midnite in america

Pulls out a rabbit, he's got a bad habit

Onto the floor
Crawls to the exit, he sings like a swallow
Knocks at her door

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Out Of My Dreams
Last night you were here again, third time this week
You always slip in when I'm asleep
I thought those old feelings would be long gone by now
Why in the world do you bother to come back around
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life
Out of every thought
That I let cross my mind
You're out of my hopes
That it might be you every time the telephone rings
But will I ever get you out of my dreams
There we were making wishes on evening stars
Promises sealed with kisses straight from our hearts
But then I woke up to reality again
Even the sweetest dreams come to an end
You're out of my arms
You're out of my life

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You [From Babes on Broadway]
Steve Lawrence,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away) [From Cover Girl]
Steve Lawrence,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart! 

[Chorus]",My Foolish Heart [From My Foolish Heart]
Steve Lawrence,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",The Tender Trap [*]
Steve Lawrence,"You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby
You'd be all my heart could desire

Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

If your nerves are wearing thin
Pack your load
Down the road
And come to Holiday Inn
If the traffic noise affects you
Like a squeaky violin
Kick your cares
Down the stairs
And come to Holiday Inn

Will set your heart a whirl

The home of boy meets girl

Steve Lawrence,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

At the fireplace while we watch
the chestnuts pop. pop! pop! pop!

There's a happy feeling

When they pass around the coffee
and the pumpkin pie

Where the deer and the antelope play.

With lights from the glittering stars,
Have I stood here amazed

Flows leisurely down the stream;
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.","Don't Blame Me [""Freddie Steps Out""]"
Steve Lawrence,"I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Steve Lawrence,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Steve Lawrence,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Steve Lawrence,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart!

And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant please love me
And I could say frenesi
A handsome caballero caught my eye
I stood enchanted as he wondered by
And never knowing that it came from me
I gently sighed frenesi
He stopped and raised his eyes to mine
My lips just pleaded to be kissed
His eyes were soft as candles shined
So how was I to resist?
And I without a heart to call my own

Because his kisses are for me alone

There, at a dance
I met my first real romance.

And I could hear laughing voices in the night

If this is heaven or this is hell
Inside your mind
That twisted device
Made up of fire
But it comes across like ice

I need to know what you're thinkin'
And why you are here
If you had power
Who would make you disappear

Laughing without smiling
I can't take no more
Dancin' in the madness
With the rope you twist that's around my neck
You know you're making me feel
Like a canceled check

[Chorus]
I said hey, you
I'm steppin' on top of your world
(I'm steppin' on top)
(I'm steppin' on top)
Hey you
I'm steppin' on top of your world

Warped by the curse
You're puttin' on me
I lay awake at night
And revenge is all I see
Time's runnin' out
But what should I do
It seems like the worst
Just ain't good enough for you
There's talkin', there's doin'
There's writing
Of things you don't know
The story's the same
But the answer is always unknown

Trying to remember
What I've done to you
You don't even know me
With the rope that you twist
That's around my neck
You know you're making me feel
Like a canceled check

[Chorus x2]",Steppin' On Top Of Your World
Steve Lukather,"I'm holding on
It's all that I can do
I can't imagine
Me without you
All alone
I close my eyes
And wake up screaming in the middle of the night
This heart
Don't need it anymore

[Chorus]
Swear your love
Say that you remember
Share your love
Hear me calling out your name
I swear my love
Wait a little longer
How will it feel to be left
Standin' there all alone

You're on your own
If you walk through that door
I'm just a man
I can't give anymore
Somewhere deep inside
There's a memory that keeps you run and hide
You gotta know
You got a place to go

[Chorus]

Somewhere deep inside
There's a memory that keeps you run and hide

[Chorus: x2]",Swear Your Love
Steve Lukather,"A thousand miles underneath my emotions
Hidden from the eyes of everyone
No one must know
All the secrets if my soul anymore
No never again

Girl you've got the only key
To open up the door only you
Eventually, even that could change

[Chorus]
I will wait for you
But I don't want to wait forever
Cause I'm on my own
I'm trying to keep the fire from getting cold
I will wait for you
But I don't want to wait
Until our love turns to stone

I don't want to turn to stone

I don't want to spend another night without you
I'm afraid my mind will start to wander
Time between us,
Hours turning into days, into years
Oh, oh, oh
Looking back at what went wrong
Some things we must let you
Eventually, something's got to give

[Chorus]

I don't want to turn to stone

[Chorus]",Turns To Stone
Steve Lukather,"A razor's edge
The speed of your thoughts
A heart as black as coal
A sudden change
A painted-on smile
A woman with no soul

Dancin' on the edge of my dreams
Dealin' with your mixed up scenes
Darlin' don't you know what I mean
Save me from this pain

[Chorus]
Twist the knife
Turn it around
Twistin' my life away
Twist the knife
Turn it around
Oh-oh

A liar's dream
A piece of your heart
Don't really mean a thing
Scream right out loud
You're feeling' my pain
See what your fantasy brings

Dancin' on the edge of my dreams
Dealin' with your mixed up scenes
Darlin' don't you know what I mean
Save me from this pain

We're running out of time girl
Slogans painted everywhere
Messin' up my dream world

I'm trying to make it on my own
Find it all by myself
I can take the overflow,
Could've been me or you
Just like somebody else

I ain't going anywhere
Without you by my side girl
Someone like you comes around just one time
Even the weakest of hearts will survive

[Chorus]
With a second chance
I know we can make it girl
With a second chance
Love will last forever

Breathing in this filthy air
Is tearing me in two girl
I hear the sirens every night
Like echoes in a cruel world

Nothing that I say or do
Seems to matter at all
Everyone is so confused
That's why I had to call

Just hearing you across the line
Is good enough for me girl
Someone like you comes around just one time
Even the weakest of hearts will survive

[Chorus]

Someone like you comes around just one time

Steve Lukather,"When I became of age
My momma sat me down
She said, son you've grown up
It's time to look around
So I began to notice some things I
Hadn't seen before
That's what brought me hope
Knockin' on your back door

A closet queen, the worst I've seen
She wants to shake my hand
I don't want to be there
When she decides she can
It's apple dan, he's just the man
To pick fruit off your branches
I can't sleep if he can't keep
His cattle off my ranches

It's too strong, something's wrong
And I guess I lost the feeling
I don't mind the games you play
But I don't like you dealing
The cards look bad, my luck's been had
And there's nothin' left to smoke
Will all be back tomorrow
For the punch line of the joke",The Bomber
Steve Lukather,"The first quiet breath of the day
Recalls the night
And as I reflect on the pain
Through tears gone dry
Am I as blind as I remind myself
Or did I depend on a dried up wishing well
Only till the end of time
Is through
I will keep
A burning torch for you

Born yesterday
Thought I knew enough
I've never felt this way
Born yesterday
Guess you're not so tough
All hearts don't break the same

Now everything seems to have
A smoother edge
But what really changed was
Suspicion in my head
Was I relieved at my naive display
Put to rest a question I never could explain
You could fool me for a hundred years
But now I won't be
Tortured by my fears

I wasn't born yesterday
Thought I knew enough
I've never felt this way
Born yesterday
Guess you're not so tough
All hearts don't break the same

I finally cut the cord
And all that went with it
And nothing is all I have to give
I didn't know
How good it could feel
Just to live",Born Yesterday
Steve Lukather,"Just silence, from the thunder
The reflection of a life
Can't reveal the light inside
But it's no wonder
Never took the chance to say
For whatever reasons why
Good intentions aren't enough
Can't afford to put them off anymore
But there's nothing to do to make it right
Cause the path of our fate won't be turned aside
Can't expect anyone to understand
But the answer is in your hands

Cuz it's borrowed time
When's the dime running out
Yes it's borrowed time
Just so much life
Without a doubt
Only borrowed time
Who decides, I wonder why
I can't say goodbye

Daylight casts my shadow like the rest
Cause the world keeps going on
And I know that from beyond
You feel my helplessness
But if you were standing here
You would laugh about my fears
Like you always did before
You demanded nothing else
Than you ever save yourself
So what am I frightened for
You were the one
To lead the way
Never fooled by the lights
That lead us all astray
And the last one to think
The worst of things
Doesn't change what
Tomorrow brings

(Chorus)",Borrowed Time
Steve Lukather,"World of fear
Dying sun

Steve Lukather,"No place left to hide
Fire and smoke on all sides
And you can't tell the sky
From the skeletons, anymore
But there's no time to wait to be saved
The wasteland will spread like the plague
And you'll wind up in somebody's cage
Without a door
Could've been me or you
But if the foot fits the shoe
It just might be a deadly dance

Paint your face
Pound your drum
But don't forget
To load the gun
Say your prayer
And drink your wine
But never let
Them see you cry

And so how will you know
When compromise offers no hope
Take a tip from that TV show
And head for the hills
Cause it's not like there's something to lose
It's only the truth
And it hasn't exactly been used
And it never will
This is not something strange
Don't expect it to change
And everything will be just fine",Never Let Them See You Cry
Steve Lukather,"Keep searchin' for someone to tell me the truth
It seems like the longer I wait
Hesitate, it comes down to you
Time won't heal
Love ain't real anymore

Halfway to daylight
And my heart is open wide
It seems like the time that we shared
When we cared
It has passed us by
Life ain't fair, when I stare
At this picture of you
I feel the touch of your hand
And the look in your eyes
Oh! Don't ya know I feel just like dying
When the tears start to fall
And my heart turns to stone
I'm tellin' you baby
I never walk alone

Life ain't fair, when I stare
At this picture of you
I still feel the touch of your hand
And the look in your eyes
Oh! Lord I feel like dying

Steve Miller,"I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
Then waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love, in the surf, in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

But lately you live in the jungle
I never see you alone
But we need some definite answers
So I thought I would write you a poem
The question to everyone's answer
Is usually asked from within
But the patterns of the rain and the truth they contain
Have written my life on your skin

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

You treat me like I was your ocean
You swim in my blood when it's warm
My cycles of circular motion
Protect you and keep you from harm
You live in a world of illusion
Where everything's peaches and cream
We all face a scarlet conclusion
But we spend our time in a dream

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy

Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy
Jungle love, it's drivin' me mad
It's makin' me crazy",Jungle Love

As they fell all around you?
Did you hear the music ?
A serenade from the stars

Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you
We're lost in space and the time is our own

Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Ah-ah

Did you feel the wind
As it blew all around you?
Did you feel the love
That was in the air?

Wake up, wake up
Wake up and look around you

Her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall
Pitter, patter, pitter, patter
Love has gone so what can matter
No lover man comes to call

When sunny gets blue
She breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the tree
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin'
Like some violins are playin'
Weird and haunting melody

People used to love to hear her laugh, to see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair
She's lost her smile, she's changed her style
Somehow she's not the same
But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry here
And brush away each falling tear and hold her near

Well you ain't lost nothin'

Has to flourish in the light

Or their spirit dies

To be all that I can

Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land

Aren't over flowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Steve Ouimette,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run
The devil's in the House of the Rising Sun
Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

We were lost and alone
Somewhere so very new
Caught in the magic of love
And your forgiveness
Selfish and too blind to see
Love was our music and, oh

I am
Lost in a world of emptiness

Somewhere, somebody new
We shared, faith without truth
With only my words left I turn
To your forgiveness

On a Saturday night all the girls run free
singing ""bury me not on the lone prairie""
but where do you go when you finish broken-hearted?
back to the dust where you started

Jenny cut her teeth in a midwest shack
as a shantytown girl on the wrong end of the tracks
her mama taught her everything she'd need to get along
and her Sunday School teacher taught her right and wrong
raised to be respectable but born to be poor
it was all she'd ever known but she figured there was more
when she came of age Jenny made herself a vow
""I'm gonna get out and I don't care how""

It appeared every Autumn on the courthouse lawn
and the leaves never fell till the carnival was gone
Michael was a barker for an arcade ride
with a smooth-talk tongue and a wandering eye
""get your tickets here for the Halls O'Mirrors maze
if you can't get out I know I couple ways""
he caught Jenny's eye but her thoughts looked down
all she wanted was a ticket going out of that town

chorus:
Oh how I want to bury you
bury you and run away--done away
how I want to bury your memory
why don't you let me be?

Michael stole a kiss then he whispered at last
""you're a little old-fashioned so forget about your past
these Bible belt folks think living is a sin
so they all start dying from the day they're born again""
and there atop the Ferris wheel the colours were a blur
the morning said he loved her but she wasn't really sure
he made her promise not to leave until he came to get her
she promised him but she should have known better

Jesus loves you still and your mama wants you home
but oh bridges burn

it was in a cattle car buried in the hay
a note in the pocket of her calico dress
said ""I'm guilty as sin but I can't confess""

but unless you bring it down you can't live with yourself

In remembrance of no one at all

Could your mercy bring me back

Maybe not his blessing
Maybe we're not asking at all

Did you fail to mention
This time we were destined to crawl?
And every day that we died just a little more
I was sure you were sovereignly watching us dangle

Seasons change, oh, so do I
Though empty promises fool my songs

A cold wind's bending the morning
And the back road bears the pain
I came with the gift of a new day
See, I leave with a gift of rain

And see two leaves falling
See they kiss, then drift away
And it's true, I really wanted you
And it's true, I really wanted you
Just yesterday...

I can see your eyes made for their crying
Like a star was made to shine
My face was meant to bear knowledge
Empty promises, fool lies

and see two leaves falling
See they kiss, then drift away
And it's true, I really wanted you
And it's true, I really wanted you
Just yesterday...

So let us strike out
Touch the new day
Let our bruises meet there
Like them, the rain has forsaken
We will need the greatest care

and see two leaves falling
See they kiss, then drift away
And it's true, I really wanted you
And it's true, I really wanted you
Just yesterday...

strike me down if you wish
For not wanting you for long
Seasons turn, so do I
Though empty promises fool my songs",I Really Wanted You
Steve Trovato,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Steve Tyrell,"My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old
Ennui
Then I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some like the perfume from Spain
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

( some like the bop-type refrain )
( I'm sure that if, I heard even one riff )
( it would bore me terrifically too )
( but I get a kick out of you )

( some they may go for cocaine )
( I'm sure that if, I took even one sniff )
( it would bore me terrifically too )
( but I get a kick out of you )

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see, you obviously do
Not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You
Steve Tyrell,"Let's take it nice and easy
It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby what's your hurry
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

We're on the road to romance - that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it every time",Nice 'N' Easy
Steve Tyrell,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you

Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

Day and night, night and day",Night and Day
Steve Tyrell,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you",Witchcraft
Steve Tyrell,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Steve Tyrell,"This is the night, it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte
Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte

So take the love of your loved one
You'll need it about this time
To keep from falling like a star
When you make that dizzy bee climb

For this is the night and the heavens are bright
On this lovely bella notte

So take the love of your loved one
You'll need it about this time
To keep from falling like a star
When you make that dizzy bee climb

Steve Tyrell,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star

Steve Tyrell,"Whats it all about Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
Whats it all about when you started out Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give?
Or are we meant to be kind?

And if only fools are kind Alfie,
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong Alfie
What will you lend ought to know golden rule
As sure as I believe, 
There is a heaven above Alfie

I know there something much more
Something even nonbelievers can believe it

Planning everything for two
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you its a crime

Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad

Just like me, they long to be,
Close to you

On the day that you were born the angles got together 
And decided to created a dream come true
So they sprinkle moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes to gloom

Steve Tyrell,"A chair is still a chair every when no one is sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When theres no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight

A room is still a room 
Even when theres nothing there to bloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us, has a broken heart

Now and then 
I call your name
And suddenly your face appears 
But it just a crazy game
When it ends
It ends in tears

Darling have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs 
And turn the key
Oh please be there, still in love with me

Before you put on your make up

I'm wondering what dress you wear now

[Chorus]
Forever forever you stay in my heart
Forever forever we will never part
Oh how I love you
Together together thats how it must be
To live with out you would only mean 
A heart break for me

Ill run for the bus dear
While I riding I think of us dear
I say a little prayer for you

At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
Ill say a little prayer for you

My darling believe me
For me there is no one
No one but you baby

So much more than words could ever say
And what my heart is filled with it takes my breath away

Its on your face, a look that  I cant erase

How long that I have waited, waited to just love you

Steve Tyrell,"One less bell to answer, one less egg to fry
One less gal to look after, I should be happy
But all I do is cry

Cry cry no more left to hold

Why did she go
I know that since she left 
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget to 
It just cant be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of her
Cause I still lover her so
Each day though, I start out
Crying my heart out

One less gal to look after, no more laughter
No more love
Since she went oh she went away

One less bell to answer
Why did she leave
Oh why, why did she leave me
Why did she go away
One less bell to answer
All I do is cry
Oh why, why did she leave me
Why did she go away
One less bell to answer
All I do is cry
Why did she leave me",One Less Bell to Answer
