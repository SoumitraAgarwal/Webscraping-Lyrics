Guy Lombardo,"When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the day you promised to come back to me
When you whispered, ""Farewell"", in Capistrano
Twas the day the swallow flew out to sea

All the mission bells will ring
The chapel choir will sing
The happiness you'll bring
Will live in my memory
When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the day I pray that you'll come back to me

All the mission bells will ring
The chapel choir will sing
The happiness you'll bring
Will live in my memory
When the swallows come back to Capistrano
That's the day I pray that you'll come back to me",When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano
Guy Lombardo,"Hear me, why you keep fooling
Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling
Little coquette, true hearts tenderly dreaming of you.
Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Now, maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets,
Now, you know, my little coquette, I love you.",Coquette
Guy Lombardo,"Did you ever see a dream walking? 
Well, I did. 
Did you ever hear a dream talking? 
Well, I did. 

Did you have a dream thrill you 
With ""Will you be mine?"" 
Oh, it's so grand, and it's too, too divine! 

Did you ever see a dream dancing? 
Well, I did. 
Did a ever see a dream romancing? 
Well, I did! 

Did you see heaven right in your arms, 
Saying, ""I love you, I do!"" 
Well, the dream that was walking, 
And the dream that was talking, 
The heaven in my arms was you.",Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?
Guy Lombardo,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Guy Lombardo,"Clothes must play a part 
To light an eye, to win a heart; 
They say a gown can almost speak, 
If it is chic. 
Should you select the right effect, 
You cannot miss, 
You may be sure, 
He will tell you this. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight! 

What appeals to me 
Is just your charm and dignity,
Not what you wear, 
But just an air, of great repose. 
You are quite perfect from your head down to your toes 
Both night and day, 
I am moved to say. 

Lovely to look at, 
Delightful to know and heaven to kiss. 
A combination like this, 
Is quite my most impossible scheme come true, 
Imagine finding a dream like you! 
You're lovely to look at, 
It's thrilling to hold you terribly tight. 
For we're together, the moon is new, 
And oh, it's lovely to look at you tonight!",Lovely to Look At
Guy Lombardo,"One night the moon was so mellow
Rosita met young Manuelo
He held her like this, this lovely miss
Then stole a kiss, this fellow
He said he was glad that he met her
And soon he would come and get her
But she said ""No, no, I cannot go
Until I know you better""

Ti-pi-ti-pi-tin ti-pi-tin

He kept on a-stealing and he had a feeling she was satisfied

Ti-pi-ti-pi-ton ti-pi-ton
She was saying ""Go sir"" so he held her closer, that's how he complied

Guy Lombardo,"You, you're driving me crazy!
What did I do?
What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy

Clouding the skies of blue
How true
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me
Believe, me they knew

But you
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me
When I needed you
Yes you, you're driving me crazy!
What did I do to you?",You're Driving Me Crazy
Guy Lombardo,"Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love, though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for a few that were there in your eyes

Dear, as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating, were murmuring low
""My darling, I love you so""

""My darling, I love you so""",Anniversary Song
Guy Lombardo,"Imagine you imagining that you love me
And starting on a family tree,
Imagine starting on a family tree;
The mama is you and papa is me.

If your heart goes bumpety bump;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If your throat comes up with a lump;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If your knees go knockety knock;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If you're coo-koo like the coo-koo in the clock
It's Love-Love-Love!

Imagine you imagining a cozy flat.
Complete with running dog and cat,
Imagine having running dog and cat
And we will have welcome all over the mat.

If your heart goes bumpety bump;
It's Love-Love-Love!
If your throat comes up with a lump;

Imagine you imagining a man and wife;
We'll go buy a fork and a knife;
Imagine eating with a fork and a knife;
How ritzy we'll be for the rest of out life.

Guy Lombardo,"Once I strayed beneath the window of a lovely se√±orita
And she smiled while I softly played my Penny Serenade

Si, si, si, you can hear it for a penny
Si, si, si, just a Penny Serenade

In her eyes shone the tender dawn of love and sweet surrender
As for me, in my heart I played a lover's serenade

Si, si, si, hear my love song for a penny
Si, si, si, just a Penny Serenade

For that night so divine she was mine, no word had been spoken
When I woke from my dream she was gone, my poor heart was broken

Still I pray that wherever she may be she will remember
In her heart she will always hear my Penny Serenade

Si, si, si, hear my love song for a penny
Si, si, si, just a Penny Serenade",Penny Serenade
Guy Lombardo,"(Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea)
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me
(She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue)
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you

Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow
And she goes sailing no more

Guy Lombardo,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Guy Lombardo,"Why don't we get along everything I do is wrong
Tell me what's the reason I'm not pleasin' you
I may kiss you but then, you don't say kiss me again
Tell me what's the reason I'm not pleasin' you

If you must keep me in doubt, how will I know what to do
You can change me about, I'll be what you want me to
Though I try and I try Still I never satisfy
Tell me what's the reason I'm not pleasin' you",What's the Reason (I'm Not Pleasing You?)
Guy Lombardo,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you

Guy Lombardo,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain",Singin' in the Rain
Guy Lombardo,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

Keep her comin'
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him, she love him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, ooh-ooh

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

He's so simple-minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

Oh, Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls (Jean Genie)
Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoah

Go!

Guy Lombardo,"I left her by the River Sainte Marie,
We pledged our love until eternity.
Along the pebbled pathway from her door
We kissed and then we kissed again
And parted on the shore;
The Angelus rang out upon the sea
I saw her kneel and say a prayer for me
When winter's gone and spring is on
I'll meet her by the River Sainte Marie",By the River Sainte Marie
Guy Lombardo,"Like the dream you dream tonight
That fades from sight when darkness disappears
Maybe you will vanish too
The moment when tomorrow's dawn appears
So, my love while stars above in Heaven's blue
Are softly gleaming I'll dream of you
And I'll live in the glory of your love
When I see the shadows falling
On a purple summer evening
Then is when I hear you calling
Across the lonely years
Oh, how well I still remember
When another summer evening
One that started out in splendor
Ended in tears
Like the dream you dream tonight
That fades from sight when darkness disappears
Maybe you will vanish too
The moment when tomorrow's dawn appears
So, my love while stars above
In Heaven's blue are softly beaming and gleaming
Then I'll live in the glory of your love",Intermezzo (Souvenir de Vienne)
Guy Lombardo,"And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
 
And then he holds my hand, mm

Guy Lombardo,"The leaves of brown came tumblin' down, remember
In September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying ember

Though spring is here, to me it's still September

Guy Lombardo,"Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly

Guy Lombardo,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
Guy Lombardo,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""

She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen
When the fellows pass her by
She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal ""yuh""
Oh my when I look in your eyth

Gave me Dinah;

Show her!

How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Guy Lombardo,"It was a lucky April shower
It was the most convenient door
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour.
I hung around for three or four.
Around a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china 
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally
If you should run into a shower,
Just step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million-dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store.
Love comes along like a popular song
Any time or anywhere at all.

Rain or sunshine
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place.
For example, take my case.

But one of the rovin' kind

I took her for some fish and chips and treated her so fine
And hardly did I realize she was the rovin' kind
I kissed her lips, I missed her lips and found to my surprise
She was nothin' but a pirate ship rigged up in a disguise

She had a dark and a-rovin' eye, eye, eye
And her hair hung down in ring-a-lets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl
But one of the rovin' kind

So come all ye good sailor men, who sail the wintry sea
And come all ye apprentice lads, a warnin' take from me
Beware of lofty clipper ships, they'll be the ruin of you
For 'twas there she made me walk the plank
And pushed me under, too, ooh, ooh

She had a dark and a-rovin' eye, uh, eye
And her hair hung down in ring-a-lets
She was a nice girl, a proper girl
But one of the rovin' kind

She was a nice girl, a proper girl
But one of the rovin' kind

From my new old-fashioned South Sea home.

With a pony on the tether pulling cold and sugarcane.

There go your knees. 
And there she goes.
She's a-hauling cane like it was gold.

And when she calls upon the dead,
To stand up in her place, 
They'll raise the roof up overhead,
And speak out from her face.
And fish jump in her boat all day, 
And flog your feet like steel.

There go the dead.
Out through the roof.
She speaks your name,
Like it was proof.

And they wait for you in town,
They pull back on the lever,
And they bring the truck around.

Guy Penrod,"Among the local taverns, there'll be a slack in business
'Cause Jesse's drinkin' came before the groceries and the rent
Among the local women, there'll be a slack in cheatin'
'Cause Jesse won't be be steppin' out again

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, ""Hallelujah"", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

The scars on Jesse's knuckles are more than just respected
The county courthouse records tell all there is to tell
The pockets of the gamblers will soon miss Jesse's money
And the black eye of the law will soon be well

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, ""Hallelujah"", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Well, from now on Nancy Taylor can proudly speak to neighbors
And tell how much Jesse took up with little Jim
Now Jimmy's got a daddy and Jesse's got a family
And Franklin County's got a lot more man

They baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, ""Hallelujah"", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Yes, they baptized Jesse Taylor in Cedar Creek last Sunday
Jesus gained a soul and Satan lost a good right arm
They all cried, ""Hallelujah"", when Jesse's head went under
'Cause this time he went under for the Lord

Yeah, this time he went under for the Lord

Guy Penrod,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross Made the Difference

At his games and plays and every good day of his life?

Guy Penrod,"Out of town for three days
When I hit the door
Kids running to my arms
As I kneel on the floor

Saying something about the puppy
And some kid up the pool
Something about something
That somebody did at school
Something whispered inside me

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like these are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep

I don't see her often
She just turned eight-two
The other day she didn't hear me
Slipping to her room

I watched her for a minute, didn't even speak
And she turned my way, her eyes lit up
She kissed me on my cheek
Something whispered inside me

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like these are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep

I heard it said we don't know
What we've got until it's gone
Time slows down for no one
It just keeps rushing on

Babe, I never told you
But sometime late at night
When we've said our last, ""I love yous""
And you're asleep but I'm not quiet
I lie awake in the moonlight

Breathe deep, breathe deep
Moments like this are treasures to keep
Listen close, look along
Breathe deep, breathe deep
Breathe deep, breathe deep",Breathe Deep
Guy Penrod,"Maggie came home one day with a raggedy, Raggedy Ann
She said. ""Mama, look what I found in the neighbors garbage can""
It had a missing left arm, and a right button eye hanging by a thread
She carried it gently up to her room and laid it one her bed with her other dolls.

[Chorus]
She loves the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up
She see's the diamond in the rough and makes it shine like new
It really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch
If everybody loved like she does, there'd be a lot less broken ones
Twenty years later at a shelter on Eighteenth Avenue
A seventeen year old girl shows up all black and blue
With needle tracks in her left arm, almost too week to stand

She says,""I'm lost an I need help"", and Maggie takes her hand
And says, ""Come on in""

[Chorus]

If you call her and angel, she'd be quick to say to you
She's just doing what the one who died for her would do
Love the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up
See the diamond in the rough and make it shine like new
It really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch
If everybody loved like He does, there'd be a lot less broken ones
If everybody loved like He does, there's be a lot less broke ones",The Broken Ones

Had questions for tomorrow
There've been times I didn't know right from wrong
But in every situation
God gave blessed consolation
That my trials come to only make me strong
I've been a lot of places
And I've seen a lot of faces
There've been times I felt so all alone
But in my lonely hours
Yes those precious lonely hours
Jesus let me know I was his own
Through it all
Through it all
Oh I've learned to trust in jesus
I've learned to trust in god
Through it all
Through it all
Oh I've learned to depend upon his word
I thank god for the mountains
And I thank him for the valleys
I thank him for the storms he's brought me through
For if I'd never had a problem
I wouldn't know that he could solve them
I'd never know what faith in god could do
So I'm singing

Baby I remember when
You and I just began 
Knowing we were more than friends I had 2 make you understand 
Said I gotta get to know ya 
Give me one chance to show ya 
Just what you mean to me 
And everything that we could be
So we talked a little 
And we danced a little 
Told me that I treated you like the perfect gentleman 
From the day love started 
We could not be parted 
Lets get back to how our love was

Back in the day
All we had was you and me but
That was all we ever needed
I was your superman girl
You were meant for me
Back in the day
The way I said I love you daily 
But girl I haven't told you lately
I'm gonna love you baby
Like I loved you back in the day
All of those things I wort
You cried everytime you read
The Friday night theater show
Where I would be watching you instead
All the bad jokes id say
But you would laugh anyway
You were my closest friend
Together 24/7 
Forever till the very end
But I haven't been there baby
Or sent you flowers lately
Lets get back to how our love was

When I look into your eyes baby
Its then I realize I've been
Acting like a fool
I'm still crazy for you
So tonight I'm gonna show ya
By the way I'm gonna hold ya

But still I always go

I guess I'll never know
That ol' familiar home

I hear that voice enticing me
Uncertainty inviting me
Feels so good
Said it feels so good

The days of yesteryear are far behind me now
There's no more worrying
About tomorrow somehow
There's no other time
There's no other place
Than where I am today
I do the best that I can do
For me there's no better way

You trade yours for candy after church is through 
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)

Guy Sebastian,"I never thought I would meet
A girl like Emily
With her ocean eyes and her crazy smile
Suddenly she and me
Were talking about all them dreams of walking down the aisle
Should have known she would go
And leave me all alone
How could I believe I was the only guy
I wish that I could have seen
What was right in front of me
Its true, love makes you blind

Chorus:
Emily was meant for me
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
But the master plan
Had the upper hand
In a story of a single man

Tell me how this story ends
Let me tell you about Sherilee
She brought me to my knees
Cause physically she was the prototype
Always looking so heavenly
But her personally was showing signs her head ain't right
She wouldn't stop calling me
Checking up on me every time I leave
Started stalking me
She was popping up everywhere I would be
It's poisonous recipe
I know the only remedy is to make her just a memory

[Chorus]

Sherilee was meant for me
I thought we'd be in love for eternity
But the master plan
Had the upper hand
In a story of a single man
Tell me how this story ends
I don't want another love gone wrong
Just another name within this song
I can't close the door
How will I ever know
If she's the one for sure

[Chorus]

Who will be the one for me
Someone I can love for eternity
I know I don't understand
But there's a master plan
In a story of a single man
Tell me how this story ends",Story of a Single Man
Guy Sebastian,"You posses a beauty deep within
That soothes me when I'm around you
Your skin is butterscotch on porcelain
My sweet tooth is glad I found you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

Never had I seen a perfect face
Till my eyes fell upon you
And never had I felt true love's embrace
Until the day I held you
Now I am in search of words to sing
A melody fit for a queen
As sweet as what I'm feeling in my heart

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

And when I think of how
I wonder
I think of how I am when I'm with you
'cause you're the sweetest berry on the vine

Like sugar on the hot black berry
Different then the ordinary
You're the sweetest berry on the vine
Like cherries deep in melted chocolate
Caramel with whipped cream toppin'
You're the sweetest berry on the vine

And baby, the way you move is quite my style

And told her she could take a seat

Her name was Janice but call her Jane
She told me she was 25
She lives at home with her mum, dad and a dog
And I just feel for every line

She said I'm new in town
Can you show me around
She said I think I'm falling for you

She never said she had a boyfriend
I never knew there was another man
I couldn't read between the lines
I must be blind

About her age about her name
She even lied about the dog
I'll never get her, I shoulda known better
'cause there was something kinda odd

(When she said hey) Hey boy I'm new in town
Can you show me around
I can't believe I was falling for you, for you

And innocence, there'd no conflicts to resolve

9 to 5 gets so mundane
But something breaks with just one glimpse of you
I would stare so long awhile
Trying to tell you with my eyes
I didn't say a thing I thought you knew

I wish I never did assume, cos...

[Chorus]
I was gonna tell you today
I even wrote the words I would say
I finally found the courage
But now it's too far
It took me all this time to reveal
What everything about you does to me
So tell me why did I keep a cover on my heart

Spend all night trying to explore just
How I'd tell you I adore ya
And how I'm moved by every word you say

But today there's an empty space
I've found you gone without a trace
I wish that I coulda told you yesterday

It feels like my point of existence
Has vanished with you in the distance
Whatever it takes I'll persist
Till I see your face again

But that?s how we are
We come back just to throw it all away


(Chorus)
Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Elevator love


We laugh, we cry
And do it again, do it again
We go to hell and back (Oohhh)
But there?s something ?bout you
I can?t keep away
Just can?t keep away
We know we?ll crash down (crashin', crashin')
But I don?t want it any other way


(Chorus)
Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love
Elevator...


Over and over and over we fall
We go up to come down, just to turn it around
And face it all again


Tell me it?s over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)



(Chorus)
Tell me it?s....over
So we can do it all again
I?m addicted to this elevator love (yea)
Tell me you miss me
And I will come back for one more day
I?m addicted to this elevator love

Guy Sebastian,"Baby let me take this chance to review
Everything I'm feelin' when I'm with you
I think it's 'bout time we set this thing straight
I know you feel it too, so
Baby don't ya get all coy with me
'cause I know that you like this boy you see
As much as you ignore it won't go away
Oh baby...

I don't need to read between the lines
'cause baby nothing ever felt so right
I ain't gonna leave until you're mine
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]
Girl, don't try to hide that smile
'cause I see it in your eyes
And I can tell you're excited, 'cause
You know I'm gon getcha!!!
Girl, this feeling can't go unheard
Won't stop till you're in my world
And baby I just can't hide it
You know I'm gon getcha!!!

Never been the kind to tolerate playin' games
It's just when I see two people feelin' the da same
It doesn't take a scientist to explain
You gotta get up, get up, get movin'

So baby tell me what you gonna do
'cause what you feel for me I feel for you
As much as you ignore it won't go away

I ain't gotta read between the lines
'cause baby nothing ever felt so right
(You know I'm gon getcha)

[Chorus]

Baby you're so fine
And if it takes all night
To getcha by my side
Won't stop till your mine

(Girl ya know I'm gotta getcha getcha)
(Girl ya know I'm gotta getcha getcha)
(Girl I gotta getcha getcha)
Baby I won't leave here until you're my...

",I'm Gon Getcha
Guy Sebastian,"Out feels like in
Ending begin
The grass is baby blue
The sky is army green

Down feels like up
I miss you so much
When or where will you be coming back to me
And help make sense of it all

[Chorus]
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
My inside out's so upside down
Whenever you're not around

Fast foward rewinds
I'm walking backwards in time
Everything that's new feels like I've done before
The moon lights the day
Since the sun lost its way
You can't hear that you're the one I'm looking for
I need you to show me the way

[Chorus]

Round in a square circle I keep turning
But everything aligns whenever I'm with you

Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Everything's out of place
Round and round and round I go

[Chorus]
",Out of Place
Guy Sebastian,"A million words a million souls
I'm stil trying to find my own
I didn't look but I found you
Throught the fog throught the haze
I lost sight of your face
Now I'm dreaming of the next time

When our stars collide
I'm gonna hang myself out
Till I dry
I'm putting it on the line
When our stars collide
Gonna make myself heard
Eat my pride
And tell you your the one
When our stars collide
I know they will collide

Burning out in the night
When I saw your satillite
Going round to remind me
I found a moon and made it ours
Then we lost it in a cloud
But we'll find another next time

I will keep gazing til you find my sky
Then I won't let you go
",Stars Collide
Guy Sebastian,"I've met the darkness
Been held by the night
Lonely was there in my arms
I've been with broken
I've stared in her eyes
Emptiness left me this scar

But I heard your voice
Calling me out of the cold

CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I've walked through fire so I could become
All that you said I could be
And now my breath has a reason
My sky has a sun
Cause in you I've found all that I need

Your touched revived me
It was your love that opened my eyes


CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

I broke through the rain
Stuck through the storm
Now I know I remain
And I can do the impossible
I can reach the unreachable

Its my time
I will rise and live

And I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before

CHORUS:
And now I can live again
I have been chosen to run with the wind
I can go higher I know I will soar
I'm taller I'm stronger I'm better than before
","Taller, Stronger, Better"
Guy Sebastian,"She gives me the kinda time
The kinda room and peace of mind
To contemplate my vanity

She'd walk through a wall of fire
Knowing I'm on the other side
She's about everything I need
And I know

[Chorus]
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
But a little bit of her touch

Other lovers always want more
Been down that road before
But you take just a part of me

All she wants in my time
Not my money or my mind
See this loves never old
Cause she's living in my soul
And I know

I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything

She knows how to start the flame
And keep it burnin' in my veins
She always understands
I can call her when I can
Make no mistake I'm always her man

I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
I wouldn't trade this love for anything, for anything
But another one of her homemade pies",Trade This Love
Guy Sebastian,"Like a shadow through the dark
In the loneliness of all I see
I'm walking 'round with half a heart
Since I lost the better part of me
I can't let go of the past
When every breath just pulls me back
To where we started

I wish I could be with you
And I miss so much about you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable
Oh I wish my heart was unbreakable

I'm tryin' to find out who I am
In the memory of you and me
I'm tryin' to see things as they are
Not the way I wish that they could be
But for now I'll just pretend
To hold you in my arms again
For one last moment

[Chorus]

If you were here tonight
I'd never let you go
And I would find a way to say the things I never said
And you would find it all

[Chorus]

'cause love means nothing without you
And my world still turns around you
And I wish my heart was unbreakable

[Chorus]
",Unbreakable

I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I'll watch 'em roll away again yea

I'm sittin' on the dock of a bay
Watching the tide roll away oh
I'm just sittin' on a dock of a bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
Cause I have nuthin' to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So, I'm just gonna sit on a dock of a bay
Watching the tide roll away, oh
I'm sittin' on a dock of a bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothings gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
Two thousand miles I Rome
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of a bay
Watching the tide roll away oh
I'm sittin' on a dock of a bay

Guy Sebastian,"Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She is my baby and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun come up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end

And tell her that I'm all alone

Remind you that you're beautiful
I know my detail requires more attention
If I ever hurt you it's not my intention

But I know that you got my back
And baby I got yours

Slowly like a cigarette
It's like water in my lungs, in my lungs

Everyday is getting worse like a curse
I'm becoming insomniac

If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

These memories are like a stain, like a stain
And it's branded on my brain
Oh I wanna fade away, fade away
'Cause every stranger has your face
And if I didn't know my name, it's ok
Girl as long as you're erased
'Cause I just can't get over it

If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up

Who said it's better to have loved
Then to have never loved at all
They were wrong, they were wrong
'Cause nothing will ever compare

If only I could wake up and not breathe you

But while they'll still strengthening these bolts
You'll never fight them alone

When your little heart breaks
Know that we feel each and every ache
Before you I never did know
Just how deep my love could go
All of the milestone and things that I've done
They can't compare to you my son

And so you don't have to worry
I won't let the big bag world get you
No you don't have to worry
I won't let the big bag world get you

Don't be scared if the mighty will lose
Keep your eyes on the horizon 'cause I'll be there

Some want a mansion in the sky
Some want a thousand virgins
Some move better with their mind

And when all the worlds collide
All they know is too divide

And the others caught between
Are the only ones to bleed
And the ones they leave behind
Can only sit and cry

Dear heart, dear life

Some fight the right to cross their dream
Some don't believe at all

And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

My gilded lily, he made me a smarty

I proclaimed myself overlord
My gilded lily gives me all this and more
I puke my guts all over the floor

Through trenches of flesh we carved a canal
Lead harlequin then drew his last
He held a bejeweled theatrical mask

We split the bill and then drove home loaded
When we got there the paint was peeling
We rose an Jell-O cubes to the ceiling

I wear the lily Gaily festooned in a manner silly
Draped in apparel I bathe in the smell I gild the lily
Adroitly crafted yet willy nilly I wear the lily
When I part with Milli Vanilli

And soon the pleasure barges
Rolled with the sun, pleasantly bloated
We mingles as one amidst debris of Debauchery,
I looked for the lily and just found me

And all the while gilded lily faded
Though it was the best I created
But gilded lily was still in place
It made a mockery of my face

And delivered us a surprise
The hulking mass of what we despised
We lurched away as we moved to snuff it
And we delivered a princely buffet

Soon the continent split all asunder
And the radios blared to the blunder
My gilded lily expanded while spinning
That's when I found out that we were winning

We piled up, peeled out, veered off and then we were gone",Gilded Lily

Despite all of the bodies that had been hacked in twain
So many had died in the viscous campaign
That their femurs alone made a fine mountain

The Master was no longer GWAR's sovereign
Of wealth and women they had none to gain
What goal was left for them to attain
So Oderus did call for conclave

First came Balsac, his council was wise
His War-Axe gleamed, he was a loyal knight
Plus forty dancing bears he did provide
Then, first in prowess, he stood his lord beside

Beefcake the Mighty, his ass was wide
Brought eighty laden oxen, he was a good ally
Jizmak the Gusha, his legion was described
For many hours he barked at the tribe

But then, timely, the catering arrived
Booze, drugs, food, four hundred hundred mule-loads high
Flattus Maximus, this he did supply
And now the mighty brothers of GWAR did band

They will to journey and slay without plan
Bring sledge and terror to the cities of man
Open Oberammergau
Like hell was a womb, it tore

And from the womb the creatures poured
Troll, goblin, Manticore
Siege machine and armored whore
There will be battle like never before

The Surface World learned of the malaise
Black Pope, usurper, he saw through the veil
They plan their defense in the land of the wasted
Africa, bitter fruit she had tasted

Ensign of industry, let it be raised
There the camp of the Black Pope was placed
His legions breath, through the valleys the raced
Charlots they rode, and their skulls were iron-plated

Belching fire, freshly painted
8000 Battalions of Knights freshly sainted
But before they fought, they were vaccinated
To protect them from the AIDS that had been created

To continue the reign of Black Pope unabated
The people at home, got a version G-rated
Here the GWAR invaded
Began the violation

The War Barges, forecastles swarming
Disgorging the troops, formations forming
The low drone of the horning
Sounding out a call, then a warning

A nuclear salvo where GWAR was encroaching
Within a second ten legions were toasting
Balsac said, ""Did you feel something?""
The Lord was not boasting

The enemy is vast, steel carpets the terrain
Still they are forming, armors detrains
They send forth a Captain, OJ by name
Flattus struck him in the brain

Burst the helmet, made two parts of the mind
Chopped through his gorget, through chest, into spine
And the good captains blood flowed like wine
Flattus said, ""So ends a cowards time.""

Balsac is angry, he'll have no more
He hurls his axe, with great effort
To smite Regis with terrible force
His shield breaks, his hauberk unsews

The axe bursts through his chest and torso
Bright blood spurts, the guts are loosed by the throw
And with that axe the soul from body goes
Said Jizmak, ""That was a heavy blow.""

Beefcake the Mighty, clotted with spew
His sword falls, skulls burst in two
The eyes burst from sockets, he is not through
Thousands of warriors he does this to

Piling up the corpses of those he slew
Until it was hard to tell if the pile grew
Balsac said, ""He is a princely lord""
Said Beefcake, ""Yes, it's true.""

Jizmak smites, his hammer whirls
Foreheads explode, entrails twirl
Breaking open brain-pans as well
Red blood flowing as souls speed to hell

Oderus smites the Black Pope, exposing his brain
The blade continued through meat and membrane
Bright blood flowed in the grass where he was lain

Are you ready for this action
Does it give you satisfaction
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'
If you are then let's start swayin'
The answer better be (Yes, yes)
That pleases me

When I touch you do you quiver
Form your head down to your liver
If you like it let me know it
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it
The answer better be (Yes, yes)

Gwen Catley,"Can I forget you?
Or will my heart remind me,
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?

Can I forget you,
Or will my heart remind me,
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.

Will the glory of your nearness fade,
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?

Can I forget you,
When every night reminds me,
How much I want you back again.

Can I forget you,
When every night reminds me,
How much I want you back again.","Can I Forget You?, song (from the film ""High, Wide and Handsome"")"
Gwen Catley,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Like to watch you all the day
And it certainly seems fine
Just to think that you'll be mine
When I see your pretty smile
Makes the living worth the while
So I've got to run around
Telling people what I've found

And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see
And when I tell them
And I certainly am goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me

Don't know how it happened quite
May have been the summer night
May have been; well, who can say?
Things just happen any way
All I know is I said ""yes""
Hesitating more or less
And you kissed me where I stood
Just like any fellow would

And when I told them how wonderful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me

'Cause now your ghosts are mine as well
I think it's time I met them and I think it's time you tell

And you should have told me when you met me
All these things I should know
I should have asked, we should have talked
About this so long ago

It's not fair, it's not fair
And don't leave me here

We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next, you never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone

And now you're finally undressing, and I feel like I might die

And how can I accept this
How is this happening to me

It's not fair, it's not fair
And I come up for air
How's this happening to me

There's me, there's you (Hoko ten)
In a pedestrian paradise
Where the catwalk got it's claws
A sub-culture, and a kaleidescope of fashion
Prowl the streets of Harjuku (Ira shae mase)

Superlovers, tell me where you got yours
Yohji Yamamoto
I'm hanging with the locals

Where the catwalk got it's claws
All you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls
In the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones
Your accessories are dead on

Harajuku girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are
I am your biggest fan

Harajuku girls
I'm looking at you girls
You're so original girls
You got the look that makes you stand out
Juku girls, I'm looking at you girls
You mix and match it girls
You dress so fly

I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene
Just an American girl in the Tokyo streets
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the States, got me feeling couture

What's that you got on
Is it Comme des Gar√É¬ßon
A Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong
Mixed up with second-hand clothes
Flip the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape
I've got oooo! expensive taste
I guess I better save up.

Work it, express it
Live it, command your style
Create it, design it
Now let me see you work it [repeat]

You bring style and color all around the world (you Harajuku girls)
You bring style and color all around the world (you Harajuku girls)

Your lookin' so distinctive, like DNA
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA
Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing, is something to encounter
A ping-pong match between eastern and western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection
Just wait til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.
Cause it's super kao wai, that means super cute in Japanese
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk
Bishoujo, you're so vogue
That's what you drop (BOOO!)

There's me, there's you (hoko-ten)
In a pedestrian paradise 
Where the catwalk got its claws (meow) 
A subculture, in a kaleidoscope of fashion 
Prowl the streets of Harajuku (irasshaimase)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours 
(At the super lovers store)
Yochi Yamamoto 
I'm hanging with the locals 

Where the catwalk got its claws 
All you fashion know-it-alls 
With your underground malls 
In the world of Harajuku 
Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes 
Wild hair color and cell phones 
Your accessories are dead on 

[Chorus: x 2]
Harajuku girls, you got the wicked style 
I like the way that you are 
I am your biggest fan, oh

Harajuku girls 
I'm looking at you girls 
You're so original girls 
You got the look that makes you stand out 
Juku girls, I'm looking at you girls 
You mix and match it girls 
You dress so fly and just parade around (arigato)

I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene 
Just an American girl in the Tokyo streets 
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt 
they're hard to find in the States, got me feeling couture 

what's that you got on
Is it Comme Des Garcons 
A Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong 
Mixed up with second-hand clothes 
(Let's not forget about John Galliano, no)
Flip the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape
I've got expensive taste (oh well)
Guess I'd better save up (cho takai)

[Chorus: x 2]
Work it, express it 
Live it, command your style 
Create it, design it 
Now let me see you work it [repeat]

You bring style and color all around the world (you harajuku girls) 
You bring style and color all around the world (you harajuku girls) 

Your look is so distinctive, like DNA 
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA 
Your underground culture, visual grammar 
The language of your clothing, is something to encounter 
A ping-pong match between eastern and western 
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection
Just wait til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B. 
Cause it's (super kawaii), that means (super cute in Japanese) 
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk 
Bishoujo, you're so vogue
That's what you drop

(And that's what you drop, and that's what you drop)

Gwen Stefani,"Don't know what I'm doing back in the studio
Getting greedy 'cause he said he had another sick flow
So I had to holla back; guess I didn't get enough
Still be the one to land, and I send the tick-tock
If you give me a clap, I'm gonna give an encore
Don't want it to end; I wanna skank some more 
I'm tripping on the best dream that I never had
I guess behind the orange curtain is not so bad

From the West Side of Anaheim, a small world after all
Hanging out at the hotel, selling makeup at the mall
Making out to ""Purple Rain"" just like everybody else
Dame un beso, now stop, I'm trying to save myself
In the ordinary calling girl way
Back in the seven-one-four days
Trying to figure what I wanna be
Hanging in the garage, me and ND

I'm just an Orange County girl
Living in an extraordinary world 
I'm just an Orange County girl

La la la la la la la la la
And the guys sing
La la la la la la la la la
And the girls sing
La la la la la la la la la

A lot of things have changed, but I'm mostly the same
These are a few of my favorite things
Still rollin' 'cause the 'Sound Of Music' 
Ain't nothing better than a great, big, huge hit
You know, I'd pay you just to let me run, dance, and sing
I know I'm living the E-ticket dream
For a girl from O.C., it's almost unheard of
So I wanna thank you all so much for the love (especially my girlfriends)

Pharrell on repeat, make a hurricane in Miami
Working with him, I'm gonna get myself another Grammy
I got the L.A.M.B., and he's rocking the Ice Creams
Blend it together, something fresh and kinda in between
Remember music is something that I love
So I don't really give a fuck
The music don't come in no color
It's time to move on hit you with the chorus

I'm just an Orange County girl
Living in an extraordinary world

I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape

I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground

So, baby, times getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way the you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Want to take you with me

You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room

I learned what love is
When we were just kids
When did you get so lost

Watching people get it on with each other

Turning, moving back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up, what did I see?

Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me

I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But, mama, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a choke hold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat, my white flag is wavin'

I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love the way she calls my phone
She even got her very own ring tone
If that ain't love, then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

Gym Class Heroes,"You think you know, but you have no idea
This is the diary of a raging onomatopoeia

Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together
I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
God's placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
Well thank ya fella,
how considerate
I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates
Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly and
Flash a devilish grin
That'll make the most masculine Men skeptical of his existence
And when the rain begins, I'll take a seat to retire and admire the spectacle
from a distance
For instance, there was this cat the other day shootin me ice grills
But when I looked, he'd look the other way
Now any other day
I wouldn't let this type of shit bother me
Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
So finally I stepped to him
Kindly disrespected him
Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it affected him
He broke down in tears talkin bout how God neglected him Hook.

Make this rain go away
Things would be much better
I swear, I swear
If the sun would come out today
Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile, worthwhile

And all it took was a sewing needle to deflate my swollen ego
Then pop pop went my God Complex
I never thought 19 yrs after my first breath I'd be in art school surrounded by corny fucks debating who's more depressed
I'm 22 now, and still can't deal with what's real
But I'll be damned if I give up and settle for pills
Shit, my Daddy taught me better
Mommy taught me how to crack 40's and jack 6 packs in oversized sweaters
Over time went the changes
So I'm in the rain waiting
For the flood gates to open
Impersonating my favorite VH1 Behind the Music tragedy
Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
I'm PH balanced
For the floor but strong enough to stay afloat
And doggy paddle long enough to catch that life preserver rope
And then I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like, ""Damn, my man for the love of Pete what happened""

And finally I'll step to you
Kindly disrespect you
Look you dead in the eyes and analyze how it effects you
Watch you break down in tears talkin about how God neglected you Hook.

Make this rain go away
Things would be much better
I swear, I swear
If the sun would come out today
Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile, worthwhile

it was the middle of spring
walkin with my boys
contiplating what summer will bring
we started talkin about girls
and it was the funniest thing
as I started to remember some of the funniest things

see there was ashley,
she caught my eye the very second that she passed me
I kissed her once
then she started to harass me
she called all night long
I had to buy a brand new phone

And let me see
there was Melanie
to have a mouth like that should be a felony
wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me
I mean dirty vocab
she used to talk like she was drunk

and after that was tiffany
the one with the cute cousin
are you kiddin' me?
she had a man
but that didn't mean shit to me
he tried to catch us all the time
but I was just too god damn smooth

and I can't forget to mention Carrie
but that situation quickly got scary
'cause after 2 dates she was like lets get married
can you believe that shit?

no matter what I do

I'll always remember Monica
the jewish chick
she'd always give me gifts for Chanukkah
to met her folks she'd try and make me rock a yarmulke
but she looked so damn good
she almost made my ass convert

and after that there was Lisa
she had a twin sister, Teresa
I bumped into them at Cam's gettin pizza
the greatest night of my life
schleps to rock that kill to birds

and there was Erica
she had the stankest breath in North America,
I tryed to slip her tic tacs
but they were scared of her
and when we made out
I always had to plug my nose

And I suppose your know the sister
shoot, I swear by hand and God
I only kissed her
I gotta foot fetish
but she got a lot of blisters
I mean hammer time feet
you think she had walked from Boca Raton

they say I gotta change my evil ways

Hey Matt,
remember Kathryn?
she talked so much
I used to make her bring me asprin
bla, bla bla bla
I'm doin fine thanks for askin
I even tried to make a muzzle
but her mouth would just not quit

Oh Shit
remember Shauna
I hate to bring her up again
I didn't want her
that girl I talked about 
in ""that girls a dog"" song
yea the poster girl for Paxil
almost made me lose my grip

and oh shit
then there was Krystal
the meth head
she used to sniff like a fist full
one time she chased me down the street with a pistol
she tried to say I took her stash
she bugged out and tried to kill my ass

and at last we got Kimmy
she went abroad
came back
and broke up with me
and so I ripped up all the letters that she sent me
I cried for like 3 days
then it was back to my evil ways

they say I gotta change my evil ways
and I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to

Gym Class Heroes,"I'm like 9 minutes away
From finishing my 9 hour shift
And wishing I was gone 9 hours ago
Cause 9 hours wasted tossing back at this chicken
I could have written 9 verses just in time for the show
Slacker mind state living on time that's borrowed
My motto's ""I'll stop procrastinating tomorrow""
I said the sorrow from the wind chimes left happiness
Lonesome and strung sarcasm to make the melody wholesome
From my lungs to my feet 
I'm breathing everything I speak
But now they're charging for oxygen
And the bills are next week
I'll be a day late and a buck short
Story of my life
I wish my pay rate was much more
Ducking swords in a rat race I didn't apply for
Running swords 
Something that's fake and thinking
Why for?
They're shutting doors right in my face 
And sit in high horses 
Is car and a dope place 
Something to die for this is my war

So now I'm schemin' on plots to make my pockets swell
Simple living is a bitch
But damn, I do it well
Some are fortunate to make it
And some of 'em fail
Some locomotives push through 
And some of 'em get the rail
Schemin' on plots
Hey Hey Hey
Simple living is a bitch
Hey Hey Hey
Some are fortunate to make it
Hey Hey Hey
Some locomotives puch through

I lead a crocodile mile lifestyle
I run and slide 
But when it's time to collide with the bump
I always bail
Cause I'm not ready for that time
That silly 9 to 5 
Solidified career option
A hop skip and a leap 
Away from a rock star 
And not too far away from filling my pops shoes
The idyllic hard working? 
With callused hands
Complete with wife, kids, dog, house, and picket fence
That's non sense, I'm conviced
I'm built for better things 
And won't settle for the empty smile that cheddar brings
It seems like I'm working hard 
Simply cause it's what they say that's what I have to do
You graduate and then you either get a job or you go to school
12 years wasn't enough?
That's more than half of my life spent 
Trying to make the world accept me
Plus I've fought the papers saying that I made it through
Now I'm working two jobs, three with music
And you don't respect me?
Fuck if I'll retire now
You're 62

watch me rock the spot like Ross ???

you know the cycle

it goes inspiration then productivity
then a sense of self worth
and in steps depression
like back and forth
and forth and back
should I paint a picture of record a track?
????????
and I don't know
I'm still undecided
but over the years I've found clever way to hide it
and those that lack the passion I have, may despise it
but my mamma made me this way,
I thank her everyday,
so tell the kids to keep coloring outside the lines
until they loose their limitations
and their minds are free
the teachers that you want your money this time
and tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
and my mamma that her baby boy is doing just fine
although he's running out of patients
but his mind is free 
and tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
and that his son is two steps away from where he need to be",To Bob Ross With Love

Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music?
Well this is your big chance.
You see, music is much like a brochetted butterfly,
With a shadowy promenade of effervescence,
Yet slows down the bottom of misty mountains of darkness.
Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror.
God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome?
It is a manifestation of love.
It a forest of emptiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it.
So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free.
Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul thieves.
Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners.
But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back.
And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not.

Exhaust fumes and rest stops who drive hard for their bucks
Load in, sound check, play show, load out, let's go, next city, oh great, off day

And nobody acknowledges that boys in bands got it so damn bad
But we love like the last cigarette we'll ever have
I'm putting miles on my body; 'bout due for a tune up in this gas station
Food ain't really helping, but I'm loving every minute
Every road sign's a reminder of exactly why we did it to begin with

This is how it has to be
A kiss for luck, submerge myself
And in seven weeks resurface
Even if we don't look back again
Tired boys and wired eyes
Exposing imperfections
To the public eye we're perfect
Even if we don't look back again

Day dreams of love affairs that I haven't had yet
Touch down, baggage claim, new town, different dame
Same clothes, seven days, whew; damn, I need to change
And it's a lifestyle that I wouldn't recommend
Wildin' out on a level Nic Cannon couldn't comprehend (fuck outta here)

Some of which were genuine and others just pretend to be
Soft raving baby, life's lovely

Until we catchin' a tan on the Florida sands

Coast to coast V8 to Chicago
To gettin' up with Johnny Cupcakes in Boston
And smokin' that most great eight in Colorado

My man Tom introduced us, but I was too shy to say 'hi'
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend, I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited two weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly, it only made me want you more
Week four rolled around, and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knocked me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same, tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin' you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moments
And now I'm emailing my love a dozen digital roses

I even wrote a song about, like to hear it? Here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)
But it's hard for me to not hate
When I'm on myspace, I never see my face in your 'top eight'
Approaching six weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter; this is not a 'LOL' matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces, and I split them down the middle
I could swing back and forth for three days (rephrase)
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and I-chat
Besides, I hit you all the time, and you never write back
I stay on my feet (shit)
And be persistent till my name is under 'who you'd like to meet'

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name?
All I know is that I'm smittin' with your pictures, wishin' you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up; it's all nonsense
Lately I've been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something

Well, who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me

Anything's better than lettin' her

Let the girl go; you know you can do better
It's bad when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you

(No, what?)
(I heard he's been hooking up with a teacher!)
(Nice!)

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room (legendary, baby!)

(Ah) I was just a snotty-nosed degenerate
With hit pass perfection
Dodgin' teachers down to give my late ass detention
Hardly a heartthrob but I made due
Using those same 'circle yes or no'
Notes I used in grade school
Folded love letters with a tab that read 'pull here'
Writin' back and forth in notebooks for a full year
I used to daydream about Ms. Magnus
The type of fantasies you feel guilty for having
But who hasn't?
The only difference beside the age
Was the fact I acted on it
And who wouldn't?
A schoolboy crush met mature woman lust
And they hit it off so well
And I could tell the day she asked me
To stay after class that it was all bad
But I just bit my lip and acted all mad
The bell rang, class dismissed
The door shut and her skirt went up (That's a fact!)

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room (legendary, baby!)

We gave a brand new meaning
To 'after-school special'
The second that our lips touched
She kissed my ribs
And counted each one out loud
I tried my hardest not to giggle
But I couldn't 'cause it tickled so much
She pulled my pants to half-mast
I said, 'hurry, Miss Sin
You gonna make me late for math class.'
The way she praised my balls was vicious
Now that's what I like to call sacrilegious
One time became twenty times
Before we knew it
We stopped caring about where we would do it
From the classroom to the bathroom
And when all the students was gone
We'd even do it in the staff room
From F's to A's in less than three days
Now the underachiever's the one with the best grades
Made the third floor shake without breakin' a sweat
Goddamn, it felt good to be the teacher's pet

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room (legendary, baby!)

(Ah) Goodness gracious, accusations
Started flyin' through the building
Cruel as school children
This isn't how it was supposed to be
Reminiscing don't stand so close to me
And if it's mostly my fault for letting this shit happen
But I couldn't resist a little adolescent bragging
I mean, after all I was only fifteen
And she was showing me things
My virgin eyes had never seen
Never forget the little meeting she called
But when she saw my reaction
It made her appalled
So basically what you're sayin' is
If I don't keep tappin' that ass
Then you ain't gonna let me pass
Psh, some punishment, lady
And as I turned towards the door
I looked back
She had her clothes on the floor
Needless to say I passed with flying colors
But my teacher was my best friend's mother (damn)

And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways (let 'em keep talking)
I'm always late for lunch
Learning dirty little lessons from you (so sexy)
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school

Almost twenty years after the fact I'm still on my hustle

Pushing daises up

Shit on since the first show
But we turned feces to fertilizer
So when you diss, it's just food for the flowers to grow
Sold fifteen plus out of backpacks, no trunks
Too young to drive
But live hip hop
And the kids are upstate kids that thought rap was past tense, hence the last name

Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old

No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links

Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke

It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend

And I know it sounds so old
But cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towels on the mat my white flag is wavin'

I mean she even cooks me pancakes
And alka seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is

We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun

But I promise this is on a whole new plane

She'll be back in my arms into my arms once more for sure

Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise

And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song

But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word

And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like you

I woke up in the back of a squad car
Handcuffed until they threw my ass behind bars
I never claimed to be an angel, I just makin' music
Something a little different you can bob your head to it
If that's crime, then fuck it, I'll do the time
But they tryin' to give me twenty five to life for every line
Go ahead and lock me up, throw away the key
But just imagine the monster you gonna make of me
And the moment that we all feared
Guilty on all charges for the dopest album of the year!

Baby boy if you've got them big dreams go and get it
Never been the type with tight jeans, I wont fit it
When I see those scene girls, bet they all gonna get it
And I'm living clean

Now a lot of ya'll won't get it
Now it's mean but I don't give a damn if ya'll don't get it
So fresh and so clean in my new jean
While I'm laughing at the bacon, you're all crying a the clinic

I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I've got my own to whirl, gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to dribble
Make your moves in that black hatch back Honda Civic

Like I did in high school, wishin' I could relive it

They said I smiled and cried until it was none left
I guess I knew what I was in for before hand
Miniature grown man ha. Third of three sons

Big bird and squirt guns
Aunt Tammy dressed up as a clown when I turned one
Scared the s*** out of me but thanks for trying
Sitting in my highchair throwing cake and crying

I remember everything, every single detail
Clinging on daddy's leg like don't leave I'll be good. I promise
I'll do anything honest
But he had to go to work and bust his a** for those dollars

Now it all makes sense, back then I wasn't havin it
Obsessed with [heatin' it?] so young and so admit
Walking [Sir Castle] grade school and baseball
And I learned that if I worked a little that I could have it all

All of my friend's had allowances, I had a paper route
And when no one was looking I threw the papers out
I got caught, made dad furious

I mean no disrespect and I apologize if this fucks up your program
You tell me I'm gonna burn for lying but the heat can turn water to wine
Well if there's a hell below then we're all gonna be just fine.

So there I stood six feet in sin, a walking contradiction
But am I wrong for posing question or am I another lost soul searching?
Then she gave me a look so unchristian and told she'd pray for my children
I said ""If you're so holy you'll probably out-live me but if I bought a Jesus piece do you think he'd forgive me?""

Maybe I would be a fool to think
That somewhere in the sky's a place for me
What good would it be to pray for me
You won't save me, don't pray for me

Now I've never been religious
I'm just a big fan of logistics
And if it makes sense then I'm all for it
I even pray if the situation calls for it
Somebody asked me if I believe in miracles
I try to answer without sounding satirical
I'm 3 years past my expiration and yet
I'm still fresher than a newborn
So I guess that's my explanation but it's safe to say
I've never seen a unicorn and I never chase rainbows
But I heard the devil wears designer clothes
So does God have a favourite brand?
And for that matter, is he even a man?
And will I go to hell for even saying that?
Only time will tell I'm just relaying facts.

Had to take the 88 upstate just to see her
My mama never liked her
My father didn't neither
After 22 years I got eager and had to leave her.
Now I'm realizing how much I really need her
But someone said follow my heart and head eastward
That's when I met Brooklyn, but Brooklyn was a cheater
The second I turned my back
Jay and Wheezy tag-teamed her
So I started packing, she asked me what happened
I told her I was leavin' her for her older sister Manhattan,
Manhattan was into rap so we started chit-chatting
And she was Chinese, Italian, black and porto-latin
Super high maintenance and way too into fashion
Didn't even tell the piecer left her number on a napkin
Damn, but back then was back then
Now I heard she went Hollywood and began acting

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh somebody take me home

Please take me home

And after Manhattan, I was acting silly
Messing with a stick-body jewel named Philly
But that didn't work out too great
I'm vegetarian and all she ate was cheesesteak
I went to Boston more for Mary Ann
And almost got married man
But she was self-centered always stuck in Maryland
I knew a slim thing named Virginia
I swear to god her body's smoking but she kept gettin' thinner
And I'll never forget my first trissie
In the pins with the Carolina twins gettin' busy
I know the history but I had to leave early
On the 85 doin' 80 Friday bright and early
And met a Georgia Peach named Annie
Who used to stay in Atlanta
Accent so thick I couldn't even understand her
And that's when I realized
I damn near ran through the whole I-95

Oh, I've been looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh somebody take me home
I've been falling in love
With all the wrong faces
Oh somebody take me home

Please take me home

Yeah, then I met Miami, she was Spanish
Miami te amo, mi chiamo Travis
She could tell that I wasn't bilingual
I don't know pogito, but I know un poquito
We can hit south beach and drink mojitos
And maybe you can introduce me to your people
Ha, yo no voi pedra
You're my first love, keep on coming
You no voi payar

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we're on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune

Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo, let's go

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine

Find the height to change your view
And if I held the world, would I have the key

The only look was someone evil laughing on their way
Tonight I'll be the one to lead the way
A troubled life will be the distant memory

To break away to break away
To find the time to heal the pain

To break away to break away
Will I turn the night to day

And I wonder why she's chasing a rainbow
will she ever see the pot of gold in me?

Screaming out, for the light of the soul

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

All I can see around us is just violence and crime
Full time for us to centralize, socialize and realize

But I don't really believe in any falling things at all

I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, separated
a nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
'cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
about some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama

GZA,"I feel I'm a threat to high powered MC's
Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by The Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
POW!, now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You want to sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up on start flipping like
I'm insane, or you'll feel the pain
I appreciate your comments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me number one cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason, or even Melquan
Cause I be flowing at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy-Mo-Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere

From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, cause then I'll be martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'

GZA,"What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed

Forget it, cause you're not hype as they want you

Is 10, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up
And it's critical, a crying shame
How many MC's challenge me, and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
Cause what I see right now is you and I
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender
NAH!, not the same way I did Brenda
But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me
But that's something you'll never see

To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my back yard there's a cemetery
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off peak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter
Thinking about trying me then reconsider
Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy

So take a lickin' as the plot thickens
While ya head is took, ya be pumping like a chicken

Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder

Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks

The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by

Inflation, starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation

We were already warned of this bloody drug war

And you think about your salary or your pay

So you think about it, say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah)
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why? They go the opposite way

The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong

Females who wore jeans that were tight
With faces resembling transvestites
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks
As if they were fugitive crooks
They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two
That's when I caught the clue
As this red-bone, who thought she looked fly
Rolled up on me, and she said ""Hi""
That one little word fucked up the whole night

I jumped up, and boy did I flip
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip

But how does he thank them for their participation
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
You never though about that, oh I guess not
All you thought about was owning your own spot
To putting more and more people to sleep
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep

And the community is getting more furious
Get it deep in your head I told you so

They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag
He had his own operation uptown
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down
In other words he was living foul
Shootin' up neighborhoods acting wild
He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades
He made sure his enemies felt the pain
Whoever he felt was a threat, got slain
Like Donna, who was only sixteen
And she was employed on another drug scene
She try to set up a hit on Steve
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe
This is what happens when you deal
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot
Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity
This is the stuff that Steve was on
Now he's dead long and gone

For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly
And just to prove I was an MC Pro
I often sponsored a classroom show
And the hype part of my imagination
Was making my homeroom a hip hop station
Minutes before the late bell would ring
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked
Because my rhymes had sparked
Off something causing the class to mingle
To a rhythm which is now a 12"" single
Letting off many styles of hip hop
Holding the mic that I made in wood shop
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable
Two math textbooks were turntables
And for a mixer, something much cooler
A penny being cross faded on a ruler
Measuring dope beats that were flexed
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk
From my home girl, her name, fly as Emory
Sweet memory
I remember sitting in my art class
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast
The outcome, a masterpiece
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see
The lyrics G.O.D.
Those were the days
Now it's high school, lunch room's the scene
And I'm ready to flip the routing
In the cafeteria, period three
And here I come with the JVC
I go in my pocket and pull out a mic
Plug it in, check one-two...alright
Now who want to show and prove their MC skills?
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill
But when it came time to live out his name
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same
But I did him in with a matter of time
And he was done with one victorious rhyme
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked
Along with his classmates from off his block
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme
Battled me and got taken out every time
From my style and my dope profile
Plus the period of time that I rocked for awhile
As a motivated, dominated supreme force
Cultivated, activated cream and source

The one who would flip an MC

What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of

On a scale of one to ten I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death of only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Munroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello

Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin' her a great mass of physical pain

She said, ""Tit for tat, step off my bra strap.
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.""
Then I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut

The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, ""FTF is always there.""

Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday

My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex

Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they want to do, is knock their boots off

And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself

They break down, and they start to cry and said
""Oh! I don't believe this guy!""

""It's all about the finances"" ""Forget the romance""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

What are silly girls made of
""Guys with cash"" ""can rock my big a--""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

Silly girls on a strip, struttin' back and forth
Watchin' cars, thinkin' of G'n off
Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything

You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
When young, now take a look at what you've become

A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me

Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Oreida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat

Is that what you do for a living get paid?
Come on, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty

Who's your rhymin' hero (look up in the sky)
(Oh you that bad mutha)
(look up in the sky)

I use lyrics versatile, beat up, on any style
Treat em like step-childs and smile
I grab the mic then I check one two
Brother's look, yo what he's gonna do
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C.
Protective... Custody
Cuz I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, cuz every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum
Gets the crowd prepared to hear some
Super, high-powered lyrics, specially chosen
The battle's a snowstorm and brothers are frozen
Thirty-two degrees below zero

[Chorus: GZA]
Now who's your rhymin' hero
(Go Genius, go Genius) (look up in the sky)
Who's your rhymin' hero
(Look up in the sky) (go Genius go Genius)
(Oh you that bad mutha)

The Genius, is a rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't (Do me!)
Yo, I'm not the type of guy
Cuz my lyrics are high powered, meaning fly
I'm not barn, I'm building hard
You thought that I was weak, well let me speak
With me being frozen this MC weather come to
All linked together
See I got wreck, wrapping things in check
You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin', you couldn't handle
A style like mine, I dismantle
Just by pickin' up the mic, and start showin'
I cold turn it out, and yo then
I get super serious strong and then furious
Give an MC something to make them curious
On, professors, in college
I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin' up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches
I go off, and off men often
See the December's Primateen mist coughin'
Cuz I'm the God building hard never barred
Bringin' crazy static to your attic
Now I'm known to flip a show

You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten word rhyme it took em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
Weak on his words and never thinkin' bout freeing
Positive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
Cuz on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
And collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To determine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, cuz I know how you feel
You lack words like mines, talent and skill
Now I'm known to flip a show

I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying 'cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties

That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin' at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin' the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
'Cuz if you do your brain is more hollow than

Space Oblivia, or The Abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs

But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a Genie
No hocus pocus 'cuz I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet

Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt

I strolled through the books of job to unfold
And open Bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take

I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom

Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome

I prophesied to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin' evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness

I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits

Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew

Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus

Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions

The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin to figure who invented

Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggaz toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin' on roof tops
For his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican

Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled

'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash

Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief

I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Going Through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so

The corner emperor - the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas

Drawed up, detect and reflect this

Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me
Sign all documents, usin forgery, 'cause just a near thought of me

Told the word I'm black and calmly

The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws

I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen

If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records, ranks us, with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred, is the word
You wild cards, Jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions, show their Spades
A large flock of MC's, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

Made the street crack, master feedback
Allah masters the beat back
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed

Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tonnes of snow
Broke this rhymin' video
Verbal assassin, blastin'
Exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously

Game controlled, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other

I seen a million tryin' to set a flow, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual thing forgot the Fri show
Now his pursuit is not for digress

A special note, thanks for being flank
While journalist's stay runnin' in front of tanks
Blew out first class, came back close cash
Ruff class, surfaces with no math

Military campaign
While shots cause information of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Filled with pain, niggaz reign

Yeah, yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin wit words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Raizah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a ?nor? face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord
G-G Maccabee, K-P-P rapidly
Aiyyo Prodical, niggas is charged wit blasphemy

Chorus [Hell Razah]
AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)

[Killah Priest]
I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

[Trigga]
Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo
(Let's mark that ass nigga)

Chorus 3x



",Feel Like an Enemy
GZA,"I wiped the chrome off wit the dust cloth
'Fore I bust off
What's the cause? Life loss, high price to pay
For a small reward
Kill for that Bush wick and Horsely broad

I provided the jump cables through to boost the mini-pack
Based on the drama unfolding in a track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like Shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth then act upon it

Or feel the fire's fore view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
That niggas are like kid, flashin' plastic tools
Unaware of the most-year dynastic rule
What stupid!

Without a doubt, it's in the heart where the best darts were written
Sittin' at the window of the grand old earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
'cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach

Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wonder the streets and experiment wit devilish men
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode

The battlefield haunting the daunting
Wu-Tang dance deadly emits six pence
Spiral rifle, barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrapped stifle, survival

Tribal, title secret rival
'Archual' subliminal message throwin'
Bitch niggas holdin' on labels
Mic cables

Capable of slowin' down jets on deck
Fuckin' you straight through continuously
Justice, wit more of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat

Drummer bills is the street prophecies fulfilled
Better chill, currents to the invited
Bang for the 'phones, live niggas on they way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn

Throw em on a auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made
It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps
Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap
Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex

Off the local brooks, not knowing
Heavy weight, throwin vocal hooks
Ryming off Apache, the Rza scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley
But deadly I merge foward, with a sharp spear
He must return now his flight departs here
Like Sittin Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous 'cause my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder
Many-a-die for fame movin like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't be	-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Til my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock, on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invinciable armor
I blaze one, once I struck the match off my bomber

Lay back, grow more chocolate than willy wonka
Stomp ya, till your head bleed, your mouth bleed
Runnin wit the heart of slave that's been freed
Triple darkness, wild like a killer from sparfit
Heartless, trained to hit movin targets
Profit, .357 cocked it
Killed you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic, money bitches layin the lessons
Allah blesses, me wit automatic weapons
Scholastic, geographic, stay jurassic
Runnin through medina wit the glock blastin
Rotten fruit, black je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose

Yo, niggas caught plaque from bitin off the platinum
Dumb mc's caught the gum disease, ask them
Who style they took, two wild rooks
Tried to take a page when I'm the author of the book
At twenty-seven years young, y'all some old timers
I write wit invisible ink, y'all use eye liners
Define rhymers, the question and the answer

",Outro
GZA,"Who be first to catch this beat down?
My rap pages be the source, ego trip remain victory and no loss
Rap sheet show you details of wars in streets
Where the most live, catch vibe and blaze heat

Double XL kings who rush through, got right on
Quick to stress ya, sound crew to get a mic on
Math lets the plates spin
Consecutive hits, promoters' face grin, the dawn catch fist

Keep the paper direct wire, see them Jake be tire
Unlike the story that echoes out with chronic liars
Like those who feast on hogs, eat murder dogs
A village voice kid with his heart and soul calm

Killa bees produce the honey, that fortify the platinum
Plus the DJ claws fiend to scratch them
Thus street team takes shots of criticism
Promotional vehicles wiffin' wit mad rhythm

With the lockout of one of our source sports
We spice the stand and launch the stage on the ball court
During the first half, number one draft
Rap Lords, swing swords, slam microphone, shatter billboards

Forty-eight in sight, after inhaling' the herb
Vision impaired, when the silhouette emerged
One nut out the clan, get your whole click banned
From radio, PD's cut your raps man

Forcin' me to move on from one world to another
On the gulf, from the fuel jet to hover
Take cover wit the radical, Urban Latino
No hip-hop connection wit us and Janet Reno

I do an interview and they aim to trace my essence
To know more than is necessary blunts your weapon
My group's nova, remain unsober
And serve high times wit king cobras

I shoulder low post MC's, your whole style la feast
Second to get your word up, then the troops unleash
Creative low fling, to the grand opening
Wit my ray gun scoping, you're hoping

Uniforms be fridged when they walk the black beat
In the heat, of razors exposin' fresh meat
In bedrock and gambling, rolling stone, out of zone
Where they can't monitor my 'xact poem
Collide wit the tiger beat, rapping raga, ebony eyes, folks see the saga

Just another victim of the...victim of the ghetto
Just another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence workin' for small pay
World so little, he could never leave his block
His home full of riddle, so he always need his glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smokin'
Young wasted minds, fiendin' on dimes, cokin'
Forgot kids quick to break rules, and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets be more safe than school
There's no diploma, that can break him from the coma
A bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner, hyenas amongst me
Yabbin' 'bout the stories, they be hearin', always swearin'
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearin'
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreamin'
Screamin' how we never hold positions, that's the meanin'
Brothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came till I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name
The GZA... 

[Chorus:]

My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set out their shops
And cops watch, innocent niggaz roam in flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner, plot to get money not
Some funny niggaz act like they could pop glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters givin' up ass a lot, brothers givin' up cash a lot
They be strugglin' to become someone because their parents not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devil uncivils society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks
And wrists the God is now a dog, the earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness
To push a Lexus, ice on everythin' from rings and bracelets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest infested buildings
Thieves uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilings
Peelin' off, but all I see is lost black babies callin'
""Please somebody save me, please somebody save me""

GZA,"I keep your heart is PZA-pumping, the beat is GZA-jumping
The crowd get wild off my style, they want something
The herds start stomping, the promoters that be fronting
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that
Security's shining flashlights like where the weed at?
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it

Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men

So heavy that it's tearing what you're wearing
Ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick, so you know it be authentic
Like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener

Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it 'The Wu, they be about it'
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap

That's the fire till my Clansmen starts to spread terror
Spin your wig back like we DJ'ing, he ain't playing
My songs set a trap, catch 'em laying
Now we stuck but he's overwhelmed by what he came across
Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop

I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio, the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows
Immaturenesses, all of your hoes, case closed
Most of your strength is in the pocket of your clothes
That you endorse in every rhyme like it's Garbeson robes

",Did Ya Say That
GZA,"[Intro: GZA]
This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
They small close in their community with crime
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams
Boy...

[GZA]
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his child passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage

[Interlude: samples]
""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""
	""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
""This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""
	""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""

The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice",Luminal

Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food

You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan

Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another

Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]

[Chorus 2X: Governor Two's]
Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we

[GZA]
How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

[Chorus 4X]",Highway Robbery
GZA,"Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll?
For the grip tells told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen

Meanin' When Emcees Came, To Live Out The Name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost

In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the (?) and the chemical contents of the sun

A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest

We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be,
(Yeah, yeah...)
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones

In front, want to impress with studdes stones

[Chorus]
Now who's the man who brought you the Legend of the Liquid Sword?
Rap critics say ""Damn"" you're sick with your's
4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin' too
That Nigga be the GZA from Wu
And if you odn't know
About the piroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize....

Why U-N-I-verse run like clock works forever?
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A story with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments

Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debree
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar

From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)

Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
on his target through a crowded market

No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
'Til it spread widely

Raise the fear, no one, but self, who's shook?
Bring the plague like the revelations in the holy book
Who's spot you took? Duke off the hook
I'm from the land of the crook, life quit the end
Better known as the Brook, rather tape then lend
There's a lot of wack records, but this ain't one of them
DJ's off the books, go 'head put the gun at them
All groupie M.C.'s, I'm bout to start stunnin' 'em
Don't matter what crew, every last one of 'em
It's gettin' crowded in here, some acts got to go
Let's start by eliminatin' groups that can't flow
I better meal my deal, my career with no fear
That none of ya'll group can touch what's over here

Negotiate your table stakes, you can't flow right

Fuck the slow light, you need to get your show right

Yo Justice, how many M.C.'s must get pistol whipped?
Crack faces with bottles of Crys', hollow tips gobble lips
That's the penalty for poppin' that shit
Vanish in a colorless whip, bags of grip
Doo-rags and clips, tag the strip
You had the chance to advance, I'm sorry for the holes in
your hip
Son, It's the way of the street merchant, live by the laws,
die by the rules
My gleam play the part of a fool
Now hear these jewels from a wise king, see what my eyes seen
Ten year supreme, the theme, we sizzle-line and triple CREAM
My grip'll off that digital bream, visual scene
Roll footage on your video screen

Stimulate phat, Sunzini, nigga, gifted and black
Now watch me mack to the kingdom of rap

Give me a beat, nigga dealin' battles like a thief
Done killed more niggas than Jason in part 3
Stay Wu, on the graveyard and this label
Dum dums, that battle 12 O'Clock, now it's able
So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, cuz lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern

GZA,"Yeah, six o'clock in the morning
That's right, we gotta get this darts right
Spray y'all niggas on some marksman shit

Yes, I said, ""Look, I got ready to graze
Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam to sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me""

Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three
Say, ""Yo, Meth, fuck it, throw a Jim Brownski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be""
Them Billie Jean shits and they real Rocky
The fans can't knock me
I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch

Once I took off the hoodie, revealed the face
Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!""
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make y'all wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me in your studio

Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief

The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands

Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood

Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle 
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble

Area's dense with the flow from the sentence 

Engine powered by five hundred horses 
Press by a threat of joint forces 
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef 
'Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat

Weak is the land that's laying in the pasture

Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch 
The rat squeals 
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals 
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles 

Here the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees 
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves 
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk 

Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk 
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain 
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra 

He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah 
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet 
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 

So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see 
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators 
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later 
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees 

The tick moved with the fleas 
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas 
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow 
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough 

See a million mosquitos from the West now 
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild

The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark 
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark 
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved 

And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist 
And the bats use their sonar to guide and a**ist 
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale 
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail 

The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes 
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes 
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor 
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula 

They both prey on gra**hoppers beetles and flies 
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies 
What costs little, is a little worth 
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf 

From birth they grow up walking the thin line

GZA,"I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck, tt was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven

And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood

We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak

And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood

Ample opportunity, infinite chances

Ya, raps need a clips that packed with lies
Cowardlessly ya shot up those innocently wise

In extra long verses hundred bars the lim'
The percentage of the truth in the rhyme is one tenth
A solid mass of minerals, easily broke down
Hard rock MC's ya nothin' but compound

Sparked by the endless greed of CEO's

Lease up my words, powerful hazardous

Put ya hole in so much inside ya gotta splurge

On these snakes with the things that, poke through your denim
When ya move it accelerates the action of the venom
But the purity and sacrifice gettin' stung twice
From those who know dikes to cars that deep right

'cause rhyme travelers are light years beyond
The Clan had a bomb that made the world respond
Considering my own future, I'm used to
Damaging MC's then pollyin' with producers

Whose main makin' cereal from two tracks of serial
Hold, that song's playin' weak ass material
We all peak at a singular point in time
Till you see the sign, decide

Knock, knock, who the fuck is bangin' at my door?

Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation

But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals spins a hundred times faster

Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser

The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces and driven back

It is very dangerous to make a raid
With the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed

Where the hoods on the block dance to a different tune
Every night and every day hotels of foul play
Turns fatal when this hostile land of AK's

On any date not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder, it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew but he was moving at a snail's pace

Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position

The mission was to move in with sheer brute force
And lives they get lost on a collision course
The streets are fascinating so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors

Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth but can't hide the evidence

Like a bank stop but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45 but he died at 9

But it needed a little more tangible proof
He was blown off the map behind the aggravated kidnaps
Shrap' metal everywhere the bomb was gift wrapped

The problem had became increasingly urgent
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent
In all the years of war this was the most
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close

A bundle burglary with no surprise
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray

Valuable time comes with a price to pay
Smoke on a deserted street just a mile away
Tusslin' with those cannibals right from the start
That'll rip out your heart and consume the fattest part

Better watch from the eye of federal agents
Selecting cams while they was disguised as vagrants
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key
Of a co-defendant he was so far from free

Detectives search into a distant past
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast

Inside a vehicle, one had his foot on the break
The windows was fully up and the doors was locked
The news made the headline and the town was shocked

The driver was clutching a can of Hi see
His jacket was tied to a near by tree
His jeans had dye in them and an usual tattoo
Was the only hope to identifying them

The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds
Dental records matched to a newly wed groom
This accident was a cover up for homicide
Two, who might have stayed alive from paying bribes

Sheets investigators had relied on the media for help
And to track down the perpetrators
They canvassed the neighborhood with standard procedure
And visited the home of a topless skeezer

Who was at the bar when he was last seen alive
Left with him just ten minutes after they arrived
Despite the police efforts they turned up nothing
Just an ex hooker tryna get a rep from bluffing

But the wide publicity had just paid off
From a hard rock inmate who was just made soft
He said he knew a man who killed the pop star
And almost got caught by a passing cop car

The inmate said probably the motive was robbery
And knowing if he keeping it a secret, it bothers me
He said this individual killed for low billings
And purchased a murder kit blocks from the killing

The sheriff's office had no time to waste
Plus the inmate never deal to avoid the case
So he cooperated fully and snitched on his chop shop mechanic
Who used to move bodies on the pulley

An extortionist involved in similar incidents
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments
Suspicious activities that flooded the place
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls were traced

The hair that was taken from his car interior
Was that of a young girl who felt inferior
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger
Holding off her life as she faced the strangler

The crime seemed to be sexual from nature
It was substantial evidence that the nigga raped her
The suspects had marks on his face and chest
But it just wasn't enough to get an arrest

An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially bears
Was a role model, like a Cardinal to our peers

A patriotic tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a dolphin
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore bangles
Drove a Bronco and she was far from Star Spangled

Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, 'cause she was behind them bills
Had a man who always roared like lion
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying

Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""Ten I See"", you just need to tighten your game

Her ancestors were chiefs, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the Seahawks, who battled the buccaneers
The redskin garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners

They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at cowboys and 49ers
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical

She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started Texan her, soon as my plane had touch down
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the Jaguar

Her brown skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a raven
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her

There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were vikings
Militant as panthers, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the charger

I introduced myself to gain yardage
Cause anything less then smooth, would of been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, steelers and panty raiders

She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would of been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line

Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was 'bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to packer, as she stroked my helmet

And I was thinking these girls was saints
But it was first and ten and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a colt, before I released them puddles

They spread eagles like wide receivers
As I ram them in the end zone, and they became true believers

You and me that breathless night
Love took shape and body
In the morning light
We were sure
This could never have
Happened before
Never before

Taken away
To a world we'd never seen
Souls and bodies keen
To know what love would mean

Making up for the nights
We had yearned
We made plans
We made a vow
All so far
From what is now
Strangers somehow

In the sun
And I can't see
No I can't tell you
How we came to be
Another you
Another me

Had I said forevermore
Never felt such urge to learn and to explore

Do you think this will change
I said 'no'

This is how
Our love will stay
Just like today

H Pisces,"Here I am, caught in your light
These cold summer nights I remember well
Home and away I run from you
But there's still too much to tell
And I wanted you to stay
But we're still on the borderline
There's still so much to say
But yet so much unsaid

Find the time, your love can flow
It's a big mistake I know
On and on, the rain will fall
And I know you'll run away
You're on my mind
I know I'll forgive you once again

You know I'll love you just the same
Thought the wind knows your name
And it's calling you again
But I just can't explain
The reason for these games
And I know you're not to blame
Here comes the rain

I'm part of you, you know it's true
But maybe you had to wait too long
To find your line out in the wild
Until you can sing your song
Believe in me, I know you well
Trust in your faith, you'll find the way
You see the entrance to the heart
But walk away instead

Look at me now, I'm just drifting place to place
Remember the smile that you wiped out from my face
If you could only hear these words you'd start believing
That you're on my mind
And I know I'll forgive you once again

You know I'll love you just the same
Thought the wind knows your name
And it's calling you again
But I just can't explain
The reason for these games
And I know you're not to blame
Here comes the rain

Even though it's such a shame
I'm sure I feel your pain
But I just can't stand the rain",Here Comes the Rain
H-Blockx,"I was sitting at my desk, I was a little depressed, 
my nerves laid back, I was busy stressed, 
messed up in the club with the girlies bt 
u I think about, think about, think about yoooo 
and I couldn't stay alone I couldn't stay at home 
so I thought about it, talked about it on my microphone, 
cause the plight that I have is to make the people groove 
the plight that I have is to make the people move 
what you wanna do, what do to groove what you want, 
what you want, what you want - MOVE

Move Ya, Move Move Ya, 
Move I said, move I said, move and go ahead 
cause if we drop that beat, you gotta feel that treat- 
ment by the bass, by the drums in your face 
wanna see your left hand wanna see your right hand 
still u gotta know we are a live bad band 
move to the rytm, move, move to the rhyme, 
you can see it, you can feel it, you can hear it in the streets 
step one to the front step two to the back 
move I said, move I said, move and go ahead, Fred!

H-Blockx,"I gotta step back, back to see reality 
Remember girls that were my destiny 
Those feelings that were always inside of me 
Always I thought - BAM - there was reality 

My heart my insight once had a bright light 
Forever I thought but I never know 
That that kinda love, onesided and not given back 
Would break my heart, yeah and would break my back 

So never again I vowed to the earth and sea 
To trust to rely on girls to set love free 
Feel the thing in my heart the way it's been before 
But life was gonna teach me, down in N.Y.C 

So my memories full of fear and agony 
I experienced the way when love is set free 
Revealed by both though never said through words 
But this time love failed 'cause distance sealed it 

[Chorus]
Think about the Real Love! 

So I was back, back in the place 
Where I started before not willing to love 
Show feelings no more, wrong time, 
Wrong place they said to myself, what a disgrace 

'Cause then it happened, emotions continuity 
Took it's toll prepared today's reality 
Courage and luck on my side and inside of me 
Are-E-A-L-I-T-why, it's been to me 

Like a dream I had as a little child 
With a thousand colours totally wild 
Bleedin' into one embracing themselves 
Brighter and more fluorescent than anything else 

And now I'm back, back in my reality 
Looking at my life, my love and feel the 
Essence of thruth, ethereal eternity 
I finally found it, God I love reality!

make me lose control, you make lose my soul,

It's time to take a stand, I've go to find a solution, 
it's time for me to plant, the plant of a revolution

Revolution 
It's time for a revolution 

I won't be satisfied till violence has died

bout all precious blood you always had to spill 

It's time to take a stand...

conspiracy rules the world and we 
can't close our eyes about the fact

For all the blackened days that came with myself;

I suffer in silence for my mistakes
Please cut me loose from my own stake

Hell, I've got promises to keep and miles to go 
Before I sleep I think of you 
And while I weep a million miles to go

That my life would depend on the morning sun

Froze up the whole block on dots and a hummy
Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down
This my time when I clown that yo click out in one rhyme

I stand taller than Sasquatch
Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

You better not miss me (don't miss me)
Or you ass is history (Bye-bye!)

In three or four places like I break the law

And the flames you tried so hard to extinguish with fear of failing
I'll write down everything I have learned
And edit it down to a single word

A little we die, above the lesser light
For you I'm open wide

Of the beat to lick a wound to
Cursed for some and blessed for a few
It doesn‚Äôt have to make any sense at all
Come hither and we'll fall
In love, for love
I'm crawling out of patience baby

Babe, I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer
A little we die, above the lesser light
For you I'm open wide
Babe, I'll be a flatliner for a heart killer

Paint all your sorrows for me to sing

Draw your pain and hear me hum it out

Away from your gods
That heal all wounds
And light this endless dark

Lonely the light shines on you 
Through the gates of fire entombed
Feeding on your love
Weak is the blaze that kept me away 
From cruelty and tenderness embraced
Saving my soul no more

And I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal all wounds and light this endless dark
That shine on you and tame your burning heart
That bury my truth right into your arms
That worship the tomb of our forlorn love",Endless Dark
H.I.M.,"love's the funeral of hearts
an ode for cruelty
when angels cry blood
on flowers of evil in bloom

The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you

She was the sun
Shining upon
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail
He was the moon
Painting you
With it's glow so vulnerable and pale

Love's the funeral of hearts
And an ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom

The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you

She was the wind, carrying in
All the troubles and fears you've for years tried to forget
He was the fire, restless and wild
And you were like a moth to that flame

The heretic seal beyond divine
A prayer to a god who's deaf and blind
The last rites for souls on fire
Three little words and a question, why?

H.I.M.,"There is no turning back
From this unending path of mine
Serpentine and black
It stands before my eyes
To hell and back
It will lead me once more
It's all I have as I stumble in
Out of grace

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

With every step I take
The less I know myself
And every vow I break on my way towards your heart
Countless times I've prayed
For forgiveness
But Gods just laughed at my face
And this path remains
Leading me into solitude arms

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

Amidst all the tears there's a smile
That all angels will greet with an envious song
One look into strangers eyes
And I know where I belong

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

Sacrificing all we have
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire
We are like the living dead
Craving for deliverance
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire

So safe in the blinding light of love unchained in yesterday's grave

Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream

Fazed by the envy and greed

And bleed the wine unholy
We fall in love with the serpent's song
And fear nothing

In the nightside of Eden
We're born again -
Dead

""Forever we are
Forever we've been
Forever will be crucified to a dream""

Deranged we're tearing away the petals of desire
Learning the mathematics of evil by heart
We deceive ourselves to start a war
Within the realm of senses
And descend to the circle number four
Where we are nothing

In the nightside of Eden
We're born again -
Dead

""Forever we are
Forever we've been
Forever will be crucified to a dream""",In the Nightside of Eden
H.I.M.,"The kiss sweetest 
And touch so warm 
The smile kindest 
In this world so cold and strong 

So close to the flame 
Burning brightly 
It won't fade away 
And leave us lonely 

The arms safest 
And words all good 
The faith deepest 
In this world so cold and cruel 

So close to the flame 
Burning brightly 
It won't fade away 
And leave us lonely
boo hoo hoo",Close to the Flame [The Rappula Tapes][#]
H.I.M.,"[Chorus]
Love's the funeral of hearts
And an ode for cruelty
When angels cry blood
On flowers of evil in bloom
The funeral of hearts
And a plea for mercy
When love is a gun
Separating me from you

She was the sun
Shining upon
The tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail
He was the moon
Painting you
With it's glow so vulnerable and pale

[Chorus]

She was the wind, carrying in
All the troubles and fears here for years tried to forget
He was the fire, restless and wild
And you were like a moth to that flame

The heretic seal beyond divine
Pray to god who's deaf and blind
The last night's the soul's on fire
Three little words and a question why

[Chorus]",The Funeral of Hearts [Acoustic Version]

That in constant dying lies 
The beauty of it all

H.I.M.,"There is no turning back
From this unending path of mine
Serpentine and black
It stands before my eyes
To hell and back
It will lead me once more
It's all I have as I stumble in and out of grace

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

With every step I take
The less I know myself
And every vow I break
On my way towards your heart
Countless times I've prayed
For forgiveness
But gods just laugh at my face
And this path remains
Leading me into solitude's arms

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

Amidst all the tears there's a smile
All angels greet with an envious song
One look into stranger's eyes
And I know where I belong

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

The Shadows
They rise and and they fall
Yeah
And our night drowns in dawn",The Path [P.S. Version][#]

H.I.M.,"Softly the light shines in through
The gates of grace on me and you
Deceiving our restless hearts
A flickering flame so serene
Devours the night so we could see
The fear we hold on to so strong

But I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal our wounds
And light this endless dark

Lonely the light shines on you
Through the gates of fire entombed
Feeding on your love
Weak is the blaze that kept me away
From cruelty and tenderness embraced
Saving my soul no more

And I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal all wounds
And light this endless dark

And I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal all wounds
And light this endless dark
That shine on you and tame your burning heart
That bury my truth right into your arms
That worship the tomb of our forlorn love

All is lost in this war
And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song

To be near but not to turn into you my darling

For what it's worth I don't wanna see you hurt anymore

Baby, love the hard way

Baby, love the harder way
Once you lose yourself entomb
I promise you love the hardest way

Pretty like a flower on a tomb you are kissed
blue by the last arrows of your sun
Olly olly oxen free
Hide and go weep
Oh, no more
Unless you want

Here's to the pain the light of the oncoming train
Come on ode to solitude in chains
Here's to the pain as always heaven in flames now bleeding

Loosen the noose love loosen the noose with love
What I want to know is why you keep me hanging

Remember not to forget this feeling you have
I've failed please pretend it never happened baby

What kind of wheels is those brah

Man, I ain't never seen shining like that

When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

[Mista Madd]
Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

[Redd]
Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

Understanding, it slips so far away and sometimes I can't deal
Don't have the time for someone else's scandal
My own life is hard enough to handle

And I still believe, most people are the same
We're so conflicted and we need someone to blame
Is it just pride or do we have to hide
All our problems, no we will never tell

And we will liberate ourselves from them - liberate
Liberate!!!",Liberate
H2O,"Am I wasting all my time chasing innocence to find
A time in my life when I should have known better?
Have I wasted all these years
Hiding back the tears behind a smiling face
Am I a liar?

Because I want to do what's right
But I need to understand
Do I burn the bridge and call it a life lesson
As these thoughts come floating in?
Will the memories race to a higher price to pay?

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the millionth time today
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say

As I fumble through my lines
Tripping wires in my mind
There's a script that failed the breach and I'm ready
From another place in time
Where the memories race to a higher price to pay

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the millionth time today
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say

Looking forward for tomorrow
Staring down on yesterday
Can't you see I'm driving blindly?
Can't you see that I'm?
Can't you see I'm driving blindly?

Am I wasting all my time
Chasing innocence to find
A time in my life when I should have known better
Have I wasted all these years
Hiding back the tears behind a smiling face?

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
For the billionth time today
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much say
I'm still waiting

Gonna take a trip down memory lane
Looking for another place to play
I'm still waiting
Gonna take a trip down memory lane
And I don't have much to say

H2O,"Who can I believe in when all my heroes are gone?
Does anybody out there know their right from wrong?
No I can't trust the president, I can't trust the cops
I can't believe my ears when the radio's on

I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
'Cause I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way

And I can't expect a teachert to keep me safe from harm
I can't expect a criminal to say he's wrong
But at the lowest standards I need a stand up friend
Someone I can look up to put my faith back in

I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
'Cause I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way
My own way

So I'm turning off the tv and I smashed my radio
'Cause I realize my heroes are the people I already know
And I'm burning up the papers and tearing up all the magazines
'Cause they make me feel so lonely
When there's no one who represents me

Am I all alone? Am I all alone?

I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I feel so lonely in your world
So disappointed in your world
I'm making my own way
Trying to learn from my mistakes
'Cause I've got no role model
No footsteps I can follow
I'm making my own way

Ha*Ash,"Era la luna, eran las estrellas 
Era la piel con unas emociones nuevas 
Era la noche, eran unas las flores 
Estando a obscuras se ve√≠an los colores
Era el deseo de estar de nuevo juntos 
Quiz√° por juego nos vemos y punto
Dar una vuelta tu mano con mi mano 
Para contarnos que este es un mundo extra√±o

Era una vez o puede que dos veces
Era un ocaso que desaparece
Era una noche con una sola estrella 
Pero era grande, luminosa y bella
Y si nos va, al mar t√∫ y yo nos vamos
Y as√≠ las olas podr√°n salpicarnos
Nadar y hacer el muerto por la orilla
Controlaremos si la luna es amarilla

Y mientras todos duermen puede ser 
Que est√©n so√±ando en ti y en m√≠
Y mientras va aclarando el alba 
Contemplaremos la noche que se acaba

El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Vendr√° el amor y lo haremos a solas 
Solo una vez por toda la vida 
D√©monos prisa que el verano se termina
El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Yo no quisiera lavar los aromas 
En esta noche siempre tan divina 
Es una pena pero se termina

Si todo pasa todo es ya pasado
Que pena que no lo he asimilado
Aunque ya no te cubra de caricias
Recordare esta noche toda nuestra vida
Y si ma√±ana siento que te hecho de menos
Ser√° por que en mi cuarto ya no tengo el cielo
Tendr√© una foto para acordarme 
De cuando aquella noche yo te repet√≠a

El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Vendr√° el amor y lo haremos a solas 
Solo una vez por toda la vida 
D√©monos prisa que el verano se termina
El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Yo no quisiera lavar los aromas 
En esta noche siempre tan divina 
Es una pena pero se termina

No caben m√°s palabras en el disco
Ni una poes√≠a que jam√°s se ha escrito
Una aventura para acordarme
Cuando ya no tenga forma de hablarte
Caminando descalza por la playa
Por donde sea por donde valla
Cada vez que yo vuelva por el mar
Tendr√© una cosa que recordar

El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Vendr√° el amor y lo haremos a solas 
Solo una vez por toda la vida 
D√©monos prisa que el verano se termina
El tiempo va, pasaran las horas 
Yo no quisiera lavar los aromas 
En esta noche siempre tan divina 
Es una pena pero se termina",Solo Una Vez

El d√≠a que menos lo esperaba
Yo no pensaba en el amor, ni lo cre√≠a
Y mucho menos lo buscaba

Y de pronto apareciste t√∫
Destrozando paredes e ideas te volviste mi luz

Yo no sab√≠a que con un beso
Se podr√≠a parar el tiempo y lo aprend√≠ de ti
Ni que con solo una mirada
Dominaras cada espacio que hay dentro de m√≠
Tampoco sab√≠a que pod√≠a amarte tanto

Luego tantas mentiras que ya ni t√∫ te las cre√≠as

Yo no sab√≠a que sin tus besos
Pasar√≠a tan lento el tiempo y lo aprend√≠ de ti
Y que aguantarme, no llamarte
Tomar√≠a toda la fuerza que hay dentro de m√≠
Tampoco sab√≠a que podr√≠a extra√±arte tanto
Ni desbaratare y que se secaran mis labios

Hoy me vienes a buscar
Pero es muy tarde ya
Me he enamorado de alguien m√°s

Yo no sab√≠a que con sus besos
Iba a reemplazar los tuyos, lo aprend√≠ de ti
Ni que existieran otras manos que al tocarme
Superaran lo que antes sent√≠

Take this nothingness from me

I want to shine
I want to rise

I find the stranger trapped inside
And I'll take one more step away
From the face I used to recognize
Familiar shadows closing in
Suffocating fear descends
You killed a life, uncovered eyes

Take this nothingness from me

A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed
I need that person much worse 'n just bad
I'm half alive 'n he's drivin' me mad
He's only human if he's to be had
I must have that man

Hadda Brooks,"Who do you think is comin' to town
You'll never guess who
Lovable, hugable emily brown
Miss brown to you
What if the rain comes pattering down
My heaven is blue
Can it be sending me emily brown
Miss brown to you
I know her eyes will thrill ya
But go slow, oh, oh
Don't you all get too familiar
Why do you think she's comin' to town
Just wait and you'll see
The lovable little miss brown to you
Is baby to me, yes, yes
Mark it down

Hadda Brooks,"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May
No shining stars
No hideaway
No soft guitar

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
'Cause my romance doesn't need a thing but you

Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
'Cause my romance doesn't need a thing but you

Hadda Brooks,"I want a little sugar
in my bowl
I want a little sweetness
down in my soul
I could stand some lovin'
Oh so bad
I feel so funny and I feel so sad

I want a little steam
on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up
so they'll go
Whatsa matter Daddy
Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl

You been acting different 
I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want some steam
on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
Whatsa matter Daddy
Come on save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some - yeah - in my bowl.

Hadda Brooks,"The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well",The Thrill Is Gone
Hadda Brooks,"Time was when you was mighty glad
To have me 'round you, that's when I found you
Time was when you, you used to favor me all day
Then you went away, I always knew you wouldn't stay

Time was when you was mighty careless
With my money, you were funny
You said that the best was none too good
Then you went away, I knew you wouldn't stay

Time was when you said lots of silly things
To please me, you never teased me
And called me a baby doll and lots of dirty names too
Now you say that we're through

And after doing all those dirty things like that
Packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time

Time was when you was mighty careless
With my money, you were funny
You said the best was none too good
Then you went away, I always knew you would go

Well, time was when you said lots of silly things
To please me, you never teased me
You called me a baby doll and lots of dirty names too
Now you say that, oh, we're through

And after doing all those dirty things like that
Packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time

And after doing all those dirty things like that
You packed up all your clothes and left your baby flat
But I can remember when there was a time

Hadda Brooks,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stairs
Hadda Brooks,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'

Hadda Brooks,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself

Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself

What is the good of me by myself?

Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving

Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew

Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you

I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you",Why Was I Born [#]
