Ken Stringfellow,"I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love  you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't' want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you",Knocks Me off My Feet [*]

Kendall Payne,"The winds came by
And they carried me away
At least that's what your mama said she'd say
Of course I knew that you would never believe
But, baby, sometimes even big girls are allowed to weep
Oh, Brenda Jean
My peanut butter queen
Innocent and bright
Don't think of me as mean
Sweet Brenda Jean
For all you have not seen
You know I hate to leave you
Fatherless at fourteen
I'm sure you think
I've left you alone
Torn apart our happy home
But, love, I never planned it this way
Never this soon
And never this day
Oh, Brenda Jean
My peanut butter queen
Innocent and bright
Don't think of me as mean
Sweet Brenda Jean
For all you have not seen
You know I hate to leave you
Fatherless at fourteen
Heaven's quite a sight to see
I'm sure you'll be here too
And though it's beautiful, my dear
It can't compare to you
Compare to you
Oh, Brenda Jean

Innocent and bright
Don't you think of me as mean

Kendall Payne,"40 days in Hollywood 40 nights in hell
How's life in your comfort zone?
Out here on sacred ground I'm doing swell
The new word is I'm crazy could have told you that before
But if you've got the guts to join me leave your sandals at the door
Because there's no turning back, no wasting time
No giving up on what I know is mine
No way I'm stopping not a chance I'm backing down
I've come to fight for mercy and take this angel town

I hear it so clear it pounds upon my heart
Who will give ear, and sacrifice to start
Am I alone? If so, it is well with me
Do you know that the truth will set you free

40 days in Hollywood, 40 nights in Hell
Sweet seduction plagues the streets I know now why she fell
But there's no time for distractions and I will not close my eyes
I'm hunting for the hurting, desperate in their cries",Hollywood
Kendall Payne,"Boy, know your place
Lies do not become us
Real is more attractive than a slick and polished mask
Girl, dig down deep
I know there's more between us
There's bound to be a question
You're just dying for me to ask

If you can be honest
I can be too
If you'll take the first step
I'll follow you through
But no one wants to bleed
No one wants to hide
No one wants to hurt alone inside

Child, don't close your eyes
The truth contains much beauty
And though it scars your soul
It can heal the wounds it makes
You've been deceived to think
That pain is to be dreaded
And you've got nothing left
It'll give more than it takes

If you can't find a peace
I'll help find it for you
I don't know how
But one thing that's sure
Is I won't leave you now

If you can be honest
I can be too
If you take the first step
I'll follow you through
No one wants to bleed
No one wants to hide
No one wants to hurt alone inside",Honest
Kendall Payne,"Good week I've got
Gonna see him once again
Been working out, reading up
Be all smart and slim
Who'd knew I'd be this anxious?
Who'd have guessed this horrid fate?
All I know is I
Have to be perfect by Thursday
Perfect by Thursday

I rarely get to see him
And his name is all I know
He smiles like a king
And that's all he'd dare to show
I'm faithfully attending
My motive almost pure
Reckless in my thinking
But it's his that I'm not sure

Perfect by Thursday
I'm planning the evening
I know what I'm wearing
And what I'll be singing
Perfect by Thursday

One day left
And it's not looking very good
I haven't seen much progress
To perfection like I should
But now I cannot quit
Because today could be the day
That all the effort
All the work decides to finally pay

And then you will fall in love
I smile when you walk by
I laugh even louder
You don't even bother

I hold every memory
As sweet as a lemon
As loose as a fire

So now he's on the TV screen
He's catching for some man
Moved away and left me here
I don't understand
But I'm convinced that he'll be back
When I do least expect
Despite my opposition
I fear that I am correct

Perfect by Thursday
I'm sprinting to make it
If I have to fake it
You know I can take it",Perfect by Thursday
Kendall Payne,"

Hey, Alice are you completely

Satisfied with Wonderland

And all it's wonder?

Cause if you're not, you know I

Heard that they're handing out a

money-back guarantee at the door.


Going blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life.


I read the paper,

And I drank all the juice

In my refrigerator, now I'm

Starved for knowledge,

Thirsty for the truth.

And in the pages I could

Sense all the longing in the world

I close my eyes, cause I'm longing too.


Going blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life.


Who knows your name,

anymore, anymore?

I'll say your name,

forever more, forever more.


Blind to the pain,

Going deaf to the sight,

Going down to the cry,

Of the innocent life,

Of the innocent life.

Kendall Payne,"The moon's worn thin 
Succumbed to the pressure
Her silver dress 
Hangs in the sky like a rag

Her coat her cloak
Her cover of darkness
It fails to hide 
The tears that she's cried
Oh she cries

But she still shines
Though the night falls around her 
And by her light
I find my way
When I fear the path laid before me
I look to the light of her face
And thank her for being so brave

The moon remains
In fullness or frailty
A faithful climb
And I stand amazed at the way",The Moon
Kendall Payne,"I am not a perfect girl, nor are you a perfect man
But we have found each other here
Inside this wild and crazy world
And somehow make a perfect match

You bring out the worst in me
But it’s the side I need to see
And through the conflicts and the difference
And damage done
We are strong and still are one

You will fail me, you will fail me
Again and again and again
And I will fail you, I will fail you
Again and again and again
Again and again and again

But we will learn to love in spite of failure
Yes we will learn to love because of failure
And we will stay together

We are broken human fools
We are selfish, we are cruel
But there is hope for the exception
To someday become the rule
Let it start with me, let it start with you

Kendall Payne,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him

Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him

Kendji Girac,"Hey papa
Estoy aqui!
Me llamo Kendji

J'avais juste prévu de rentrer
Et puis sur toi je suis tombé
Tu as la peau qu'on voudrais goûter
Et le sourire muy caliente
Comme si le temps s'était arrêté
Au ralentis je t'ai vue t'avancer
Devant ta beauté j'reste planté

Me laisse pas solo solo
J'veux pas te saouler
Je veux juste un tango et te voir tanguer
Est-ce que t'aimes danser te balancer
Arrête un peu de penser et laisser moi t'enlacer

Solo, solo
De toi j'suis fou eh
Dis moi c'que j'dois faire pour t'amadouer
On pourrait bouger se mélanger
Se mettre un peu en danger oh

Conmigo, conmigo venga bailar
Conmigo, conmigo venga bailar
Conmigo, conmigo venga bailar
Conmigo venga bailar

Tu me regardes et fais ton entrée
Premier regard je suis charmé
Tu es un ange venu me tenter
Et je pourrais bien succomber
Entre nous y'a le fuego, l'envie
Tant de désirs inassouvis
Si le désir est de la partie

Me laisse pas solo solo
J'veux pas m'imposer
Mais j'tai dans la peau
On pourrait causer
Est-ce que t'aimais danser te balancer
Arrête un peu de penser et laisser moi t'enlacer

Solo solo
De toi j'suis fou eh
Dis moi c'que j'dois faire pour t'amadouer

Kendji Girac,"J'étais une menteuse, je me suis abandonnée au feu
Je sais que j'aurais dû lutter
Au moins, je suis honnête
Je me sens comme une ratée
Car je sais que j'ai échoué avec toi
J'aurais dû mieux te traiter
Car tu ne veux pas d'une menteuse (allez)

Et je sais, et je sais, et je sais
Qu'elle te donne tout
Mais chéri, je ne pouvais pas te le donner

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille
Plus aucun rêve ne me tiens debout

Alors une dernière fois
Je dois être celle qui te ramène à la maison
Une fois de plus
Je te promets qu'après ça, je te laisserai partir
Bébé, je m'en fiche si c'est elle que tu portes dans ton cœur
Tout ce qui me préoccupe c'est que tu te réveilles dans mes bras
Une dernière fois
Je dois être celle qui te ramène à la maison

Tout seul je dérive
Si de ta peau tu me prives
Les minutes sont des années
Quand le cœur se laisse aller
Viens, on recommence
On s'accorde une deuxième chance
Rattrapons le temps gâché
Arrêtons de nous cacher

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
J'pourrais changer d'avis
Mais tu resteras mon seul amour

Et je sais, et je sais, et je sais
Que tu as tout
Mais je n'ai rien ici sans toi

Oui, attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis
Je suis juste un fantôme
Attends-moi
Sans toi, je suis
Sans vie, sans idéaux

Je sais qu'on ne peut jamais remonter le temps
Pourquoi ne pas s'apprendre à s'aimer au présent?
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis
Je suis juste un fantôme

Je sais que j'aurais dû lutter
Au moins, je suis honnête
Mais reste avec moi une minute
Je te jure que je ferai en sorte que ça en vaut la peine
Car je ne veux pas vivre sans toi

Alors une dernière fois
Je dois être celle qui te ramène à la maison

Kendji Girac,"On a pas tous eu la même chance
La même vie ni les mêmes souffrances
Je suis pas là pour juger ta peine
Mais je voudrais qu'on se comprenne

Pour voir derrière les apparences
Derrière les sourires et les silences
Je voudrais que tu te souviennes
Ma vie aurait pu être la tienne

Souvent j'ai eu peur de m'exprimer
Juger avant même d'avoir parlé
Et si on savait se regarder on saurait

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

On n'a pas connu les mêmes ambiances
Chacun ses rires, chacun son enfance
Il y a mille choses qui nous séparent
Mais on caresse la même histoire

Devant la douleur on se ressemble
On a tous eu le cœur qui tremble
Derrière tes peurs regarde bien
Je pourrais être l'un des tiens

Souvent j'ai eu peur de m'exprimer
Jugé avant même d'avoir parlé
Si on apprenait à s'écouter on saurait

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Et quelques fois je dois l'avouer
La différence est lourde à porter
A l'heure où les peines reviennent,
Reviennent, reviennent, reviennent, reviennent

Même si le monde n'est que beauté
Par la colère on se laisse emporter
On oublie qu'on est tous les mêmes

Mon frère je sais qu'on est tous les mêmes
Avec nos rêves, avec nos problèmes
Et si tu regardes à l'intérieur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs

Des mots d'amour et des simples gestes
Quand tu perds tout c'est ce qu'il te reste
Toutes ces richesses qui nous viennent du cœur
Je sais qu'on partage les mêmes valeurs",Les Richesses du Coeur
Kendji Girac,"Tu viens le soir, danser sur des airs de guitares

Tu as dans les yeux, le sud et le feu
Je t'ai dans la peau

Être plus heureux qu'hier
Cette main tendue quand je tombe

N'attend pas l'été pour te paumer
Y a des jours comme ça où tout va de travers

Un sourire, un soleil quand tout s'assombrit
Abîmé, harcelé
Des envies d'crever
Ton sourire, ce soir-là, m'a sûrement sauvé
J'irai là-bas, là-bas, au sommet

Oh
Va de l'avant,

Et prends le temps
Oh

Ne pas essayer, c'est échouer,
Mourir sans avoir vécu

Le genre de femme qui change le plus grand délinquant en gentleman
Une beauté sans pareille, tout le monde veut s'en emparer
Sans savoir qu'elle les mène en bateau
Hypnotisés, on pouvait tout donner
Elle n'avait qu'à demander puis aussitôt on démarrait
On cherchait à l'impressionner, à devenir son préféré

Cette femme était nommée, Bella la peau dorée
Les femmes la haïssaient, d'autres la jalousaient
Mais les hommes ne pouvaient que l'aimer
Elle n'était pas d'ici, ni facile, ni difficile
Synonyme de magnifique, à ses pieds, que des disciples
Qui devenaient vite indécis, tremblants comme les feuilles
Elle te caressait sans même te toucher

Kendji Girac,"C'est une façon de voir la vie
Un peu plus grand qu'un pays

Kendji Girac,"Ah ça j'adore ce morceau
Kendji

J'ai passé des heures à chanter tard dans la nuit
Pour m'amuser un peu ou pour tuer l'ennui
Pour le fun, pour draguer les copines
Pas pour passer dans les magazines
Je bossais pas pour pouvoir toucher le cœur des gens
Mais le destin en a décidé autrement
Je suis là devant vous sur la scène
A vous donner mon amour et ma peine

Y a eu les plateaux, y a eu les photos
Y a eu les télés, et les bilans chaînés
Quand ça s'arrêtera, je ne sais pas
J'ai même chanté la sérénade à Eva Longoria

Tout a changé, je suis passé
De l'ombre à la lumière

Mais je la joue cool, cool, cool
C'est vrai que j'en ai tant rêvé
Et je roule, roule, roule
Même sans savoir où je vais
Je la joue cool, cool, cool
J'ai pas l'intention de changer
Et je roule, roule, roule
Avec ceux qui m'aiment, qui m'aiment (Eh)

Cool
Cool

J'ai passé des nuits à jouer sur ma guitare
J'ai rêvé de concerts, jamais de la gloire
Pour kiffer, passer des soirées folles,
Pas pour devenir une star ou une idole,
La chance a décidé de s'venger sur ma vie
Depuis je passe mon temps à jouer de ma voix
J'pensais pas un jour être à la une
J'me sens prêt à décrocher la Lune

Y a eu les tournées, les gens par milliers
Les vues par millions, par la télévision
Si par le destin, tout finit demain,
Je ne sais pas où j'irai mais je sais d'où je viens

Tout a changé, je suis passé
De l'ombre à la lumière

Mais je la joue cool, cool, cool
C'est vrai que j'en ai tant rêvé
Et je roule, roule, roule
Même sans savoir où je vais
Je la joue cool, cool, cool
J'ai pas l'intention de changer
Et je roule, roule, roule
Avec ceux qui m'aiment

Mais je la joue cool, cool, cool
C'est vrai que j'en ai tant rêvé
Et je roule, roule, roule

Kendji Girac,"Je crois que j'étais bien trop lâche
Pour lui dire adieu les yeux dans les yeux
Parti sans même prendre bagage
Pensant faire ce qui était mieux
Je fait toujours ce même rêve
Je me vois remonter le temps
Revenir à nos plus belles balades
Tous les deux sur les quais les yeux vers l'horizon

Elle m'a aimé de tout son amour, de tout son cœur
Elle m'a donné tout ce qu'elle avait quand je n'étais rien
Qu'est-ce que j'ai donné en retour
Je n'lui ai causé que du chagrin
Elle qui ne rêvait que d'amour
J'avais son cœur entre les mains

Des souvenirs au goût amer
Caressent mes doutes les plus sensibles
Sachant que mes actes d'hier restent à jamais irréversibles
Je sais que je n'étais pas pour elle
Pourquoi me manquerait-elle autant
J'y repense à me rendre malade
Et toutes les nuit j'espère retrouver la raison

Elle m'a aimé de tout son amour, de tout son cœur
Elle m'a donné tout ce qu'elle avait quand je n'étais rien
Qu'est-ce que j'ai donné en retour
Je n'lui ai causé que du chagrin
Elle qui ne rêvait que d'amour
J'avais son cœur entre les mains

Je l'ai revue deux ans plus tard
Maman d'une jolie petite fille
J'ai compris qu'il était trop tard
Dans ses yeux cette lumière qui brille
Elle m'a dit faire ce même rêve
Se voyant remonter le temps
Revenir à nos plus belle balades
Espérant que j'revienne un jour à la maison

Elle m'a aimé de tout son amour, de tout son cœur
Elle m'a donné tout ce qu'elle avait quand je n'étais rien
Qu'est-ce que j'ai donné en retour
Je n'lui ai causé que du chagrin
Elle qui ne rêvait que d'amour
J'avais son cœur entre les mains",Elle M'a Aimé
Kendji Girac,"J'ai une question à te poser
N'aies pas l'esprit mal placé
Dis-moi si chez toi, ce soir,
Y a de la place
J'ai pas envie de m'imposer
Je serais assez discret
Mais chez moi, tout seul la nuit,
Oui, je me lasse

Hé, qu'est-ce qui te ferait plaisir?
Dis-moi ce que je peux t'offrir
Dis-moi juste le moindre de tes désirs

Mais, ne mets pas de petite tenue
L'alcool n'est pas le bienvenu
On mettra juste nos idées à nu
Tu me diras tout ce que tu penses
Mais il n'y a rien qui te dispense
On dira sûrement que l'on s'est jamais vus

Pour un gros câlin
T'auras qu'un coq à l'ail, sur un coin d'canap
Sois 10, dingué
J'te l'dis, fois dix
Car les lourdingues qui me draguent, 10, t'inquiètes
Viens, mets pas de trucs chelous ou bizarres, ou j'te refoule, fissa
Faut qu'tu saches que je n'suis pas une courtisane
Tu t'crois diplômé en drague
Pour me passer la bague,
Il te faudra des cours du soir
Passes, dans ma tanière
Mais avec classe,
Avec glace, Häagen-Dazs, macadamia
? mais pas sur l'oreiller,
J'te fais confiance
On f'ra comme si papa me surveillait

Kendji Girac,"J'suis pas novice, j'aime innover

Pour t’le dire j’ai tout essayé
Tu passes ta vie à me stresser
Je vais finir par te laisser
On était bien, qu’est-c’qu’on s’aimait
Mais là le mal est consommé
Les mots j’peux même plus les trouver
Dis-moi c’qu’on peut encore sauver
Pour toi je fais des efforts
Même tes copines sont d’accord
Qu’est-c’que tu veux d’moi encore?

Là c’est trop, moi j’abandonne
Moi j’abandonne, moi j’abandonne
Là c’est trop, moi j’abandonne
Moi j’abandonne, moi j’abandonne

On va pas tout gâcher, encore se clasher
Exploser en plein vol et se crasher
On fait n’importe quoi faut pas s’gâcher
J’ai des choses à te dire quitte à t’fâcher
J’ai pas envie de te lâcher
Mais les mots faut pas les mâcher
Est-c’qu’un jour enfin tu vas changer?

Là c’est trop, là c’est trop
Là c’est trop, moi j’abandonne
Moi j’abandonne, moi j’abandonne
Là c’est trop, moi j’abandonne
Moi j’abandonne, moi j’abandonne",C'est trop
Kendji Girac,"Chez moi pas d’étrangers
Chez moi on sait comment s’aider
Chez moi on sait comme s’aimer
Chez moi on sait comment rêver
Dans les joies comme face au danger
Toujours quelque chose à manger
Toujours quelqu’un pour me parler
Quand j’ai le cœur un peu blessé

Et, si tu savais comme j’ai pu prier le Ciel
Prier qu’il m’entende
J’attendais là juste au bord de la route
Que la chance vienne me prendre
À l’abri sous mon étoile
Il fera jour demain
Pour la famille et les miens
C’est ma vie, mon histoire
À coups de rêves et d’espoir
Comme il n’est jamais trop tard
Jamais trop tard pour y croire
Jamais, jamais trop tard
Jamais, jamais trop tard
Jamais, jamais trop tard

Chez moi on parle fort
Pour se donner du courage
C’est pas le mauvais sort
Mais du soleil sur mon visage
Chez moi les chercheurs d’or
Ont tous la tête dans les nuages
Chanter, danser dehors
Tu vois c’est mon seul héritage

Et, si tu savais comme j’ai pu prier le Ciel
Prier qu’il m’entende

Kendji Girac,"On dit des mots qu’on ne pense pas
À trop crier on reste sans voix
La vie nous sépare, le temps ne répare pas
Les cœurs en éclats, les cœurs en éclats
On s’fait du mal parfois sans l’vouloir
On s’retrouve seul dans un long couloir
On prie pour remonter le temps
Juste une seconde avant de détruire tout espoir

Ce soir, ma solitude et moi, on parle que de toi
On attend tous les deux que tu reviennes
Quand il n’y a que tes yeux qui me retiennent
Ce soir, ma solitude et moi
C’est fou comme on a froid
J’me nourris de silences, et tout me pèse
Je sauve les apparences mais rien n'm'apaise

Quand les sanglots ont tué la joie
Quand on s’est pardonnés trop de fois
On rêve, on s'dessine un présent
Un peu plus beau qu’avant
Pour aller vivre où l'amour est roi

Ce soir, ma solitude et moi, on parle que de toi

Ce n’est pas ta main dans mes cheveux
C’est juste le vent capricieux
Qui souffle sur nos souvenirs
Et qui me vole à ton sourire
Ce n’est pas toi derrière la porte
C’est juste le vent qui t’emporte
Le silence ne sait pas mentir

Kendji Girac,"Mes potes et moi, on a fait des soirées playa
On a mit le fire jusqu’au petit matin

Mes potes et moi, depuis l’temps c’est une longue histoire
Faut nous voire pour y croire, comme les doigts de la main
Ils sont toujours là quand j’en ai besoin

Quand l’un d’nous est en galère
Il prend des mauvais départs
On l’aide sans en avoir l’air
On lui donne une touche d’espoir

On est ensemble, toujours ensemble
Ils sont toujours là si je tombe

Une bande de tarés
Qui pensait qu’à s’marrer
On s’est parfois clashés
On s’est jamais séparés

Mes potes et moi, même quand on n’a rien on l’partage
Avec ou sans bagage, on peut voyager loin
On a toujours eu le cœur sur la main
Mes potes et moi, on a eu des hauts et des bas
Des embrouilles, des faux-pas, on en a connu plein
On s’réconciliait autour d’un refrain

Quand l’un d’nous perd ses repères
On est là comme un rempart
Quand la vie ne sait plus l’faire

Depuis que tu vis dans ses bras
Il a retrouvé le sourire
Depuis que tu es son avenir
Tu es devenu sa joie
Mais tout a changé quand
J’ai compris qu’il parlait de toi

Kendji Girac,"Des armes, des larmes, l’humain
A le cœur qui devient opaque
Ô drame, otage de la culture du meilleur
Nos actes deviennent
Le reflet de nos peines

La nature nous maudit
Des missiles, des soldats, des débris
Le climat s’échauffe comme les esprits

La nature est encore là
Les nuages ont caché le soleil
Et on détruit même nos forêts
On s’est perdus très loin des choses simples
Plus rien n’soulage
La mer est polluée par nos forages
Le matériel nous commande
On n’a pourtant besoin que de choses simples
De cyclones et de tonnerre
Quand la nature est en colère
On a détruit nos forêts
On ne sait même plus qui on est

Noise from the boys with the rocks in their fists
Looking to bring a man down to the bottom of a thousand ton well
One tiny push send that man into hell
He hit with a thud there'll be no work tomorrow
Just a funeral for a guy with time that he borrowed

Isn't it crazy
Ode to the one that'll drag you down
Isn't it crazy
Ode to the one that'll let you drown
Wait for the call it'll come by tomorrow
Your banshee, your lust, indifferent sorrow
Honey don't run 'cause there's nowhere to go
She's got your number she got your code

Blue is the color your skin fades to when there's no pump of
Blood through your veins or your heart or when you got no love
Trouble is looking for someone to drain
The rattle does roll when there's something to gain
Was it the shove that done did that man in
Or the lady who came and blew in with the wind

Isn't it crazy
Ode to the one that'll drag you down
Isn't it crazy
Ode to the one that'll let you drown

Honey don't run 'cause there's nowhere to go
She's got your number she got your code

Tell your brother, your friends
Can't lock your doors 'cause she's already in
Dressed all in black with a staff in her fist
She wails to her hounds
Sink their fangs with a kiss",Banshee

Stir up the pot with your magic.
And while you at it find me a rabbit.
I need some luck for this bad habit.

Pow
Today was the day that I died.
That's when I lost it, oh, my mind for the last time!
Can you help me with your spells and your powder?
In the ground like it's murder.
But I wanted to, 'cause that's just how I found you, my love.

Pow
What you go and what you learn

Find it now before you bum

Before what you do, do it so you hate
What you go and what you learn.
Find it now before you bum.
Later or a better grade before you do ya do ya hate.
Serpent friend, take me home to your mother.
Where I can sit with you. serve me venom for dinner.
Something poisonous makes me wanna drink what's ever left.
Trap me in a salty haze.
My heads wound up with guilt for days.
It's most certainly what you do.
Ooh, your spells and your voodoo.

Kendra Morris,"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision,
rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",Shine on You Crazy Diamond

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Six in the morning, fire in the street
Burn baby burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watching you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or something but homie you made me
Black don't crack my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels bout
I'm black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you that I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black

I'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' I'm sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Dareous
Excuse my French but fuck you, no fuck ya'll
That's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell because it's threats when I see you
I can tell because your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 80
And you feeling like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
That the world is 'bout to end who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808, a melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank, technology bumping soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, the president is black
She black too, purple label on her back but that dap
Is light blue, she take it straight to the head

She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ok, then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said, ""Where my drink at?""
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80's that ADHD crazy

I've never seen a crop circle
But I've seen a cop circled the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'ma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear the screams (Uncle Sam ain’t no kin to me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

Section 80’s babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell

The homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin

Unified people they going to peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it

Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started hiiipower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
Like what if Keisha were celibate
What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend

And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Our Future's odd)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped

What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn

See a lot of ya'll don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money
Hoes, clothes, god and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
Til' one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, god and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
Because you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star
I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being, over dope ass instrumentation

While a pervert yelling at her and she capture features of a woman

And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father,
That's ironic see a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked

Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

Her castle is about to be destroyed, she's always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide,
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise,
To no surprise she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat

She suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This muthafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street Keisha's song

When a bullet might hit
And you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it
Live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like
He did, cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait
Let's be straight, to the point

As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mack 11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I""m right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry about it
I give em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin' a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems: more money, more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest
That's on my life, but regardless I'ma

Ride to it, ride to it
Cause I never know
When a bullet might hit
And I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it
Live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like
He did, cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait
Let's be straight, to the point

Yea, life can please ya
But death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice
What would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more
Do more
But tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven saying
They at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it
Family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?

I used to want to see the penitentiary
Way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge
In the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
To save me, how I'm gonna listen
When I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that killed with ya, squealed with ya
I deal with ya like my son
Stare at the sun and you'll be lookin'
In my eyes homie stand for something
Or fall for anything, and you working
With two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined
To blow, that you hear the music
I wrote, hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the Pen is in
My view, I'mma get it right, just so you

Smoke good, eat good, live good

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessey and my real
Niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have
To come and get me
If it feel good to you
Holler if you hear me

You like to mistake a street nigga for a real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya, will squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I’m 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
On 'Wanna Be Heard,' probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for
The world that minute
So the next time he roll up
And drop grams in it, he'll probably be
Out of work, laid back, while he

Smoke good, eat good, live good

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessey and my real
Niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have
To come and get me
If it feel good to you
Holler if you hear me

Continue to hustle and grow and develop by

You know what I’m talkin' about?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand, I

That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite

A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery

Put em in their world

And just like that it was
Only getting they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the
Biggest question mark
They curious now
Cause when women get sick of men
They think of a big helping hand
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over
It'll be alright
The minute she hit the block
And turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go

I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money tea-bagging your honey you thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife you're looking like steak and when the stakes are high, I stake out for days

No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to empty my memory bank

I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
And still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint,
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral (Haha)

Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation my fort
Leader of the new school,
On my toes like a ballerina who knew I'd be Black Swan
World in my palms, ironically I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16 that I'd write a 16
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen but now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life but now I'm running the map bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ol' me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puffy Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose like bla'!
Mini-14 like bla'!
Empty out another magazine like bla'!
Let a young nigga get by!
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe!
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job

Everybody sit your bitch ass down and
Listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I’m with the homies

It’s 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I’ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic ‘cause I’ve never been violent, until I’m with the homies

(Just ridin’, just ridin’)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin’, really trippin’)
Me and the homies
(Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’…)

Bragging 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you saying""
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – ""Hello? What you doin'? “Kicking it”
I should’ve told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission,
Drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight

Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight

Fell on my face and I woke with a scar

Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga

Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll

And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine

Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre

I make 'em holla""

Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station baby

Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect

All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say roof
And you ask, ""Lift up your shirt""
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: ""He's probably young but I know that he's down""
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know he'll never respect

20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best

""Man down
Where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?], YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all. Duck.""
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do

Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough

Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n' 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah

Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!

I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you
When you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and them?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs

'Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind

I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word ""but"", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there

And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get em""
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope --

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section .80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga where the fuck is u going nigga, this bullshit...

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her"" so
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams are balled in like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed was my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
""See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""","Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"

Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

Now I done grew up
Round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago

Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me:

Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank

Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me

Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock

I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?

Aw man, what is she taking?
Where is she taking
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got Hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open
I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust
But just when I thought I had enough",Swimming Pools (Drank) [Extended Version] [Version]

I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly

I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon, Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordan's and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy

My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top forty
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical
Three niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I can do
I wasn't jealous 'cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly
Out of Compton

Thank God
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly",Black Boy Fly [*]
Kendrick Lamar,"We on?
Aight
One, two, three, go!

Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

I'm so high,, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth 
'Cause the people that hurt can’t understand it
You speakin' outlandish, I’m gonna show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it’s a short term role for me
A record sold for me, it’s just mo for me
And you’re here for you too here, Kendrick, persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off, I ain’t takin' off these pistons
I’m takin' off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it’d cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I’m past that, now pass that
A word not one but four times two plus yours

I see myself performing at
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's, winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can’t imagine how it feels
That’s why I’m smiling every day
'Cause my dream ain’t far away

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

You’re looking at me and tell me I’m blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I’m at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I’m reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I’m a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I’m a take that I’ll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down, in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I wrote 
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin' to you, I was walkin' it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello, we here

And I’m so happy I cry
'Cause I can’t believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it’s so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I could wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you’ve come so far
And you know, that is the time for you to lift your bar
And I’m gonna do it
Watch me

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better

I'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better",Now or Never [*]

I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians
Push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello my name is Kendrick""
She said ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (cool)
""Where you stay?""
She said ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well is it Compton?""
""No,"" she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
""What you trying to get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well

The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius' reputable
Family history of gang banging did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off
I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see

I was in the dark room loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon

Kendrick Lamar,"The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you to know me
Within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and, real talk, and

This is why they fuck with me
Real talk nigga, believe it
This is why they fuck with me
Do what I do, y'know?
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol' up
Where you from? (I don't bang)
Where you stay? (Westside) that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

This is why they fuck with me
I told you, nigga
This is why they fuck with me
You fake, nigga
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?

This is why they fuck with me
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (c'mon)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'mma leave you with this

A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money, I'm gone",Average Joe

Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cuz I'm the only nigga there not smokin' no herb
You tellin' me the kush make you think on level 4?
I'm on 5. You sayin' that I can level more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smokin' stress
Didn't know my eyes low cuz of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time, creation of man and Columbine

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or hydro
I don't even smoke (x3)
I really appreciate that you share your indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke (x3)

Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cuz they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights - off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talkin' bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like my son's about to win
Somehow some day and I don't care when
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist

Uhh, I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fuckin' up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
I didn't listen
I was floatin' like the Rose Parade, swear to god a nigga seem some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fuckin' monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter capital K-D-O-T layin' it flat out
Like a tire with slow leaks now what you bout?
Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt?
Yeah

Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block

Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss

This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off, in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss

And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal, you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss

As the speaker that spoke when they done speak",Ignorance is Bliss

You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
""My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this
But I see you and me Kendrick

Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring

Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy

Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me

Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me

My American tongue was slurry

A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it

Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you

My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat

And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy

I looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God

Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for

One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?

But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay

Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton""
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' ""Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?""

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

Waitin' for you

I know everything, I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs the lows the groupies the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home

We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway

Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:

You think she gon’ stick around if them twenty-five years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it’s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

And if you ridin' with me nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analyzing, that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy’s Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y’all, it’s respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it’s Michael Jackson, oh

Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain’t really a poem,
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground
What you mean ‘bout that, what the ground represent?

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
That’s how I see it, my word is bond.
I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetizing,
You know what I’m saying, wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor and hungry
You know what I’m saying it’s gonna be like
There might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich

Aight so let me ask you this then,
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

I see myself as a natural born hustler,
A true hustler in every sense of the word, I took nothin’
I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody manage me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
You know what I’m saying I made myself a millionaire
I made millions for a lot of people now it’s time to make millions for myself,
You know what I’m saying
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us

And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game,
And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
You know what I’m saying, and it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know I mean it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart
Or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

I like to think that at every opportunity
I've ever been threatened with resistance it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win and I wanna lay it all down

In this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager
While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
While you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it’s like they take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me you can look around,
You don’t see no loud mouth thirty-year old muthafuckas

That’s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind
I can truly tell you that there’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on
So I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it’s a riot there’s gonna be bloodshed for real
I don’t think America can know that
I think American think we was just playing and it’s gonna be some more playing
But it ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying,
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

That’s crazy man. In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left
Is music and vibrations
Lotta people don’t understand how important it is
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’mma push out,
Or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

Because the spirits, we ain’t really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
It says

""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""

What’s your perspective on that?

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper

Where was your antennas
Where was the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you

Little brother, you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches

I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof

Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me

Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year

Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?

I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

And when they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme uhh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker, I smile

When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?

Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin' I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body

Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time

We could save that shit, this for the kids bro

This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here

And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro

We gon' get back to the show and move on, 'cause that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to
All my niggas listen, listen to this

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said ""think about what you saying, fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on D'Jango
No better than a white man with slave boats
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retrace my steps on what they never taught me
Did my home work fast before governement caught me
So I'mma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artist gave her an explanation to hold us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royality King royalty, wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we be using it wrong
So I'mma break it down and put my game in the song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey
Tell her she right on time

Kendrick Lamar,"Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he's alive""
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go

Just take it all back before the light switch",untitled 01 | 08.19.2014.

Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk
How can I make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' sobriety
Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the end of Section Park
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I'm gone

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle

Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loop holes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tape worm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple drinkers they seein me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleep walkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or is this just a mirage or a facade

No you're not easily impressed

Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause

I wanna pick your brain when I see you

Kendrick Lamar,"Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?

I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell ""Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy""
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said ""nigga you fucked up""
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town

In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

Kendrick Lamar,"(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)
What's up family, yeah it's yo cousin Carl man, just given' you a call man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately
And I know you feel like ya know people ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this man, that we are a cursed people
Deuteronomy 28:28 says
""The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness
And astonishment of heart.""
See family that's why you feel like
You feel like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this mufucka?

(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)

I beat yo' ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes
Runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up, I beat yo' ass
You better not run to your father, I beat yo' ass
You know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I can smoke fear away, I roll that motherfucker up
And then I take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now

(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die 'cause these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now, now

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings
With me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap

Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all

Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse
Because he said he's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities
For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods
That aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you
So just like you'll chasten your own son
He's gonna chasten you because he loves you
So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us
We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today
In the United States of America
I love you, son, and I pray for you
God bless you, shalom",FEAR.
Kendrick Lamar,"Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?

""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it""

She replied
""Oh yes, you have lost something, you've lost your life""

Is it wickedness?

Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views

Uh, Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song
Quote ""and we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'""
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it",BLOOD.
Kendrick Lamar,"I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don’t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin’ in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA

You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula’s oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I’ve done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that’s a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage
To young African Americans than racism in recent years)
I live a better, fuck your life
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA",DNA.
Kendrick Lamar,"It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me

We gon' put it in reverse

Darling I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you sweetheart that my—

Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and joking made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack
A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing
That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old
Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off and walked back
To the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hoping that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works
Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with nines
Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager
And shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact it look like
They're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time, reverse the manifest
And good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers
And put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can
Make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers
You make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits
Then you start reminding them 'bout that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper
Would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

So I was taking a walk the other day",DUCKWORTH.

Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and the feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs
Stuck in our ways, lust

Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately my lust been hiding (Lately)
Lately, it’s all contradiction
Lately I’m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear

Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord

In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I care

Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Talkin' out his head philosphin' on what the lord had done
He said, ""K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome""
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him

This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed""

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

Keni Thomas,"I remember every holiday
Our whole town lined the streets
Waitin' on the big parade
From the curb in their lawn chair seats
And one old man always the first to stand
And snap a sharp salute
And one by one the crowd around
Would rise and follow suit

For the streamers flew like eagles
And the battle banners waved
For all the ones who fought and died
To see Old Glory raised
To each and every hero
Who has ever come and gone
The flags of our fathers carry on
The flags of our fathers carry on

Marching bands and the motorcades
Paper flowers and the floats
The beauty queens and their pageant waves
Oh, but what I remember most
Was that one old man always the first to stand
With his hand across his heart
And how his eyes welled up with pride
When he saw the color guard

As the streamers flew like eagles
And the battle banners waved
For all the ones who fought and died
To see Old Glory raised
To each and every hero
Who has ever come and gone

Somewhere, someday knew he?d have to rise above it all
Told his family he?s gonna go fight for his land
Little brother can hold down the farm, and Mama please understand
Mama begged him not to go
Mama lost her little boy, but a country gained a hero

The desert air hit him square in the face, and boy you were right
Somewhere in between the fight he finally new what it meant to be alive
He was just 3 years shy of 21, and they gave that boy a gun
Mama begged him not to go
Mama lost her little boy, but a country gained a hero

Yeah, well, some say a hero is born to be brave
But I?m here to tell you that a hero is a scared man that don?t walk away

Mama sits by the flag of the USA
Tears well up in her eyes as she bows her head to pray
And she says, ?Son, I know you had to go?
But mama lost her little boy, but a country gained a hero

Yeah, gained a hero
Well, it gained a hero
We gained a hero
Yeah, gained a hero
Gained a hero

Keni Thomas,"They put a new sign up today
Where everyone could read it
The folks who paid to have it made
Must think that I need it
It was selling Sunday service
Been a long time since I've been
Sign said, ""Are you man enough 
To walk along with Him?""

Billboards for Jesus. Is that how its gonna be?
Try and sell religion on a sinner just like me
Am I man enough? Am I strong enough?
I'm thinking, ""Who the hell are they?
Don't need your billboards for Jesus
To show me the way.""

Come next Sunday morning
I found myself in church
I walked in a cynic
But at least that sign had worked
My heart was worn and leathered
My attitude was tough
When the preacher man he asked me
""Son, how'd you hear about us?""
I told him
Billboards for Jesus that's how it came to be
Took a sign for me to find
My way down on my knees
Am I man enough, am I strong enough?
Lord, I hope and pray
Billboards for Jesus show me the way

We got hurricanes
And heartache pains
Brothers in Iraq
A world in need of rescue 
And friends who won't come back
But our doors are like His arms
Wide open every day
If your hurting 
Come inside my friend
I'll gladly show the way (I'll be your)

That I'm about,

Is all the future holds for us when 
Everything I do is a circle leading back to you
Everything you say twists me round a different way

Put your whole self in this picture
Take some time to figure out
Wrap this quilt of contradiction warm around you now
Stay strong, take care
There is no distance left to trace, map or line we can erase, 
Cost of this forgotten dream is written on my face
Who can tell the reason why there's a sun in this blue sky
Everything I do is a circle leading back to you
Everything you say twists me round a different way
A different story a different point of view
Every dog will have his day, every man must have his doubts
Everyone will find their own way out, every silver lining has a
Cloud

And I know where it came from,
No need for chewing gum,

I saw her today you know, she`s filling up with ammo... 
(la la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

Here we are again 

She was always wide,
Now it`s drinking her out from the inside,


He filled her with champagne, got a tattoo, forgot her name...
(la la la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)

In the car again.
Now her kisses, full at first,
Ache like blisters waiting to get burst


She is alone, he`s been here but know he`s gone...

I guess it's just another, toy that we can't find.
I guess we'll all just write our checks,
And cash away today.
Because nothing's ever in our head,
When nothing's in our way.

So you can have your way.
With twenty choises to choose at your meal today.

The people who live there are all working for us

Artists get cream turn fiend 
Selling people a dream 

Aiyyo  you rappers don't amuse me wit your crystals or oozies 
Industry groupies  living after movies 
They scarfaced my race  some support hate 
Lifes a court date  some die to escape so hold your weight 
You niggas brag too much  fuck wit us we bag you up 
And use the same clique that you thought would back you up 
It's nine eight eliminate bait and open gates 
Enough with chains and whips lets make brains eclipse 
We all claim we rich, hold thugs in crypts 
Forgot about the seeds growing up seven to six 
Fuck a Benz wit tints I got the razor prints 
Y'all rappers love idols there it is I'm convinced 
Burn my contract, mental combat 
And stomp your battle rap wit a Vietnam track 
Red and white Sadaam rap sippin Cognac 
I bet you didn't loopb know that the real Jews are black

The world or the heavens? 
God or the reverend? 
Your girl or your weapon?

Here in this life 
Big cities a dream on the low is the scheme 
A fiend that clock green without jockin somebodys sting 
About the plot 
You pull the ox who pull the stash outlock 
Yo wuddup I, about ready to pull the rabbit out the top 
Platinum gold oops upside your knot 
Now nigga stop now nigga please 
You ain't really ready to roll them sleeves 
With your three degrees forty below nothin but recipes 
Tight jeans, hype and don't know what nuthin means 
Acting like you Billie Jean selling How to be a Fiend 
When your loves about black marketing a nigga for his cream 
And the big apple it ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled she's a queen 
From out of town wagging her swing 
All around with she glasses and women asses is what made men jack asses 
Everything including your company jacket 
And niggas asses for your ransom 
And next thing you know they got a nigga dancin 
Chancin him out of his advancements 
And how y'all gonna pay back these back taxes? 
This ain't healthy for your assets 
It's like your face done been bashed in your career ain't happning 
After the monkey wrenches and forks done been stabbed in 

Intruiging to the ear but bitter to the heart 
I begin to take part in The Art of Dart Throwin 
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsmen 
Raindrops fall the block remains hot 
Steam rises from the street which forms the clouds that I move through 
Renew my stainless sword style 
Allah has spoken the golden code of silence has been broken 
Mic terrorist shroom brew wickedness improves 
As I ascend and expand extend I seen men 
Fall from greats trying to trace the origin 
But there is no beginning or end to the lifeline 
Sunz of Man forever shine through the mic line

Of the bar code, he was more sold like Old Gold

I'll and hardcore ready for tour shakin breakin jaws 
Makin new laws open the doors healing my sores 
Blessing the poor, the art of war we less a boar 
Verse one we guard a star and the starting artist 
Another target on your market style is garbage 
You get bombarded whole clique slapped retarded 
Pussy harded mcs bleed slugs to the body 
It's physical domination lyrical laceration brutal termination 
When you fuck wit the federation, collaboratin wit my nation 
Discussing allegations conversating about the downfall of Satan 
Ghetto frustration keeps my head piece achin 
Constant motivation keeps my world in rotation

Too many single mothers raisin' our kids
Too many brothers caged in the Pen
Engagin' a bid, enslaved by the pigs

If it wasn't for crooked cops that pop shots grazin' our wig
That sends slugs reckless, plus these thugs with a death wish
That take your life for the ice that flood in your necklace
The blood of the helpless and innocent (and innocent)

If it wasn't for so-called friends that turned Benedict
Snakes in the grass and crabs in the lake
'Cause I'm black and its late, getting' harassed by the Jake
Blasted with eight times five, plus one

Lethal deposit, reach for your wallet, they bust guns
That's why I trust none and I keep to myself

Playing rappers like a ho, manhandlin' the dough

Demandin' them to go on a track to bring the loot back
Now you playing for the team and the captain, that's cream
You got the dream to push a mean two-seater
With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one

You make the songs, but labels only want the hot ones
Send you back to the drawing board, until you got some
Now I guess we got problems
Even your all-creative mind ain't enough to try and solve 'em

The doors revolvin', younger cats are starvin'
They want it more than you, might go to war with you
To reap the heap of dough that's at the end of the rainbow

In the cold world where we bust off the black llamas
Every winter where we lose more son to black mommas

If hip-hop got seasons, right now its spring
Like when everybody selling death, ""kiss the ring"" (yeah!)
You know how it goes, people change color like autumn
Kids learn through experience, fuck what a teacher taught 'em

Puff a relief for boredom; rough will release a quarter
And the parents who paid enough attention to at least ignore 'em
Blowing up mics, throwin' up signs
To help niggaz you confusin' it with cryin'

Mystery looks past prisoners of war, that's what my listeners are for

She comes to me
With solace for my spirit
Thoughts in cages
Locked in mazes
Hearing only echoes of yesterday

Met my demons and fightin' angels
7 times a million ties
Through phases and the ages
Consumed by the fire

Still
When the sun goes out
And the night is all a haze
Let the flood come down
And wash it all away
Baptized in black light
I feel your touch
And I'm whole again

I'm a criminal
Who surrendered
Found my truth in the consequence
Blind but guided
Divided
With a mind that's born again

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

Have you met my good friend Maria
The craziest girl on the block?
You'll know her the minute you see her
She's the one who is in an advanced state of shock

She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain
She isn't in love
She's merely insane

It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas

Keep away from her
Send for Chino!
This is not the
Maria we know!

Modest and pure
Polite and refined
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind!

I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
That the city should give me its key
A committee
Should be organized to honor me

La la la la 

I feel dizzy
I feel sunny
I feel fizzy and funny and fine
And so pretty
Miss America can just resign!

La la la la

See the pretty girl in that mirror there

What mirror where?

Who can that attractive girl be?

Which? What? Where? Whom?

The most beautiful sound I ever heard:
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria
All the beautiful sounds of the words
In a single word:
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria

Maria!
I've just met a girl named Maria,
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same
To me.

Maria!
I've just kissed a girl named Maria,
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound
Can be!

Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing,
Say it soft and it's almost like praying.

Maria,
I'll never stop saying Maria!

Kenni,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

That were burning

Close to mine

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here

Told the tale to me

From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

To make its lakes so grand

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

I'm so lonely

I walk along with you

Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Kenny Barron,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All
Kenny Barron,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Kenny Barron,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, alone and apart out of a dream, safe in my heart

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow Of Your Smile
Kenny Blake,"Every night
I'm lying in bed,
Holdin' you close in my dreams;
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
And comin' apart at the seams.
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough;
I know you were tryin'
To give me the best of your love.

Beautiful faces,
Loud empty places
Look at the way that we live,
Wastin' our time
On cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give.

The same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above,
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.

Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love,
(You get the best of my love.)
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.
(You get the best of my love.)

I'm goin' back in time
And it's a sweet dream.
It was a quiet night
And I would be alright
If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be

Kenny Burrell,"People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside

They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul

No more hunger and thirst

Kenny Burrell,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""
A common ground",The Common Ground

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Grocery store, ten bucks
Just making change for plastic cherries
Up in a tree, jaybird
Laughing at me, no word
Everyone looks, you can't see
We can't be ignored easily

[Chorus]

Soft within the wayward things
Like ecstasy
The sound of trees
Most anything
What a baby sees

Beautiful face, alright
Many a place, out of sight
Old woman there with red shoes
One million balloons, all used
Drive over hills, forget your fear
Getting it out of second gear

Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me
Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me
Oh please stay old fashioned with me",I'm Old Fashioned
Kenny Burrell,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

Kenny Burrell,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Kenny Burrell,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance
Kenny Burrell,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks
Kenny Burrell,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Kenny Burrell,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Kenny Burrell,"My blue horizon is turning gray
And my dreams are drifting away
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
Your love and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says ""No, no, you're not the same""

More lost without you and so it goes

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Kenny Burrell,"Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do

The softer the skin
The sweeter the love
The more bitter the end

Kenny Chesney,"If you don't get in the water you're never gonna learn to swim
He said a snake is just as scared of you as you are of him
He could tell by the moon when the fish would bite
Seems there was nothing that he didn't know
And as a kid I believed 'cause Grandpa told me so

He talked Daddy into letting me have my first car
I thought I was really something 'til Becky Thompson broke my heart
That first taste of love really did me in
Getting over her slow
And I knew someday I would 'cause Grandpa told me so

He said life is made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go
And I live by those words 'cause Grandpa told me so

I promised him I wouldn't cry when it was his time to leave
That's the only promise I made him I couldn't keep
He smiled from his bed and said we'll meet again
Somewhere down the road
And I believe 'cause Grandpa told me so

He said life is made for you to live
The best love is the love that you give
There'll be times when you want to hold on but you gotta let go
And I live by those words 'cause Grandpa told me so

If the roof was old and the rain came in
Honey would you stand by me

If I tried my luck in Hollywood
Honey would you stand by me
If my break never came like I thought it would

And never complain when the money was low
If your coat was thin and your shoes were old
Honey would you stand by me

Honey would you stand by me
If we traveled around from show to show

And smile right on when times got lean
If you didn't have nothin' but boots and jeans

Kenny Chesney,"I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
My and my woman was just getting' right
All systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows - zero visibility
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

You can wine and dine a woman all night
With good intent
But there's something about a confrontation on a back road
Breaks down the defense

Steamy windows - ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer
And it starts things happening again

Steamy windows - zero visibility
Steamy windows - coming from the body heat
Steamy windows - steamy windows",Steamy Windows
Kenny Chesney,"No I ain't had nothing to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I stopped by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the Y
When they started talkin' 'bout the steps you take
Mistakes you make, the hearts you break and the price you pay
I almost walked away
You could hear a pin drop when this ole man
Stood up and said, I'm gonna say it again like I do every week
For those who don't know me...

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most when you lose control
Everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
I've been there, that's why I'm here

This ole boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been living a life of denial and he cried
As he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of a sudden it was clear

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most when you lose control
Everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says, no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
I've been there, that's why I'm here

For us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand and say

It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most when you lose control
Everything you love starts to disappear

Have another shot, just one more beer

I didn't say
And even though
It may be too late

I still love you so

Looks like your car
Every movie I see
You play the leading part
You're on my mind
Can't leave you behind

When I close my eyes
You're all I see
In the dark of night
You're in my dreams
Throughout the day
You're easy to find
You're always there
When I close my eyes

In my mind I know
You're far away
But here in my heart
Nothing has changed
I'm still holdin' you
Like I used to
On a busy street
In a crowded room
Wherever I go
It's just me and you
Together again
Girl it never ends

No hard feelings wish you all the best
No blame, no shame
Just time to say it's over I guess
We both agree it's the right thing
The only thing left to do

Sometimes love don't work out
No matter how hard you try
Lord knows we didn't start out to say goodbye
If it's a win-win situation
Then why am I feelin' so blue
You win, I win, we lose

You take yours, I'll take mine
We'll leave nothing but the memories behind
Of a love, and a dream
That just somehow faded with time
You say you're goin' your way
I'm goin' somewhere too

Sometimes love don't work out
No matter how hard you try

Kenny Chesney,"The summer breeze, made ripples on the pond
Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord",Baptism
Kenny Chesney,"She lived at the end of a little dirt road
In a house where secrets go untold
Barefoot in a cotton dress, dark hair in a tangled mess
And a head full of crazy dreams
She said

I'm going to California
A place where the sun always shines
I'm goin' to California
And I'm leavin' everything behind

You can't help, but feel a little bit touched
When your daddy loves you a little too much
You can wish on four leaf clovers, but all the fields have been plowed
Over
And there's nothin' left to do but fly away

I'm going to California
A place where the sun always shines
I'm goin' to California

Of you and me, down in Mexico
Just look at us there on that beach, on that blanket

Everywhere, every time our hearts meet, love is all around us
Every road we take, darlin' love takes

Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter

Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight's the night, feels like perfect timin'
Down on one knee on momma's front steps,
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes

She said, ""Show me that you really love me""
And then tell me
'Cause I really need to know?
She said, ""Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me?""

I got down on my knees right there and I promised her I'd change
'Cause deep inside I knew that she was right
I said, ""I know we've drifted and there's only me to blame""
But I don't want to waste another night?
And somewhere in the darkness there we found a brand new start
As I took every word she whispered straight to heart

Over by the gate, yonder here she comes
With a basket full of chicken
And a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
I open up the throttle and stir a little dust

She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me

While it's tillin' up the land

Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on

She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny weenie ride before I take her home

I'm doin' all that I can to get my mind off us

What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's goin' down on my broken heart
Lord, I gotta go back before I get too far

You ask me if I love you, if I always will

Inside I built a wall so high around my heart, I  thought I'd never fall.
One touch, you brought it down
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me that I wasn't going to love again

Well the honeymoon ended, and life began,
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends,
And the apartment got smaller every day.
Then one night, the walls finally closed in,
I came home late, she said ""Where have you been?
You used to call and tell me, ""you're on your way.""
She said, ""If this is how this is gonna be, then I quit.""

Unless you got something they ain't got

And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said I'll have some of that
We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair
He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed
He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl
Married his high school love
And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa
Bein' right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up
Yeah man that's the good stuff

He said, when you get home she'll start to cry
When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I
Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up
'Cause that's the good stuff

That's the good stuff",The Good Stuff
Kenny Chesney,"You know that restaurant on highway one
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun
Where we ran in our bare feet
Built a castle on the beach
Just the wind,the rocks, the waves and you and me

[Chorus:]
I can't go there
'Cause that's just too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
There's places in my heart and head that feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
'Cause I can't go there

Remember San Francisco on that cable car
Our reflection in the window of that store
How we danced the night away
With the lights out on the bay
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor

[Chorus:]
I can't go there
'Cause 'Friscos too much us
I can't go there
I still feel your touch
Now there's places in my heart and head that
Still feel as empty as our bed
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs
'Cause I can't go there

If it was only Florida or California
Maybe I could let myself move on
But its everywhere we've been
And everywhere I turn
I can't love again
'Cause I've learned

That I can't go there
It's somethin' I can't do
I can't go there
I'll run into you
I can't go there

When the sun shines, when it rains
Christmas parties, football games

I can't go there

Kenny Chesney,"I'm sittin' here alone,
Thoughts of you run wild.
I'm longin' for your touch, 
Haunted by your smile.
No use tryin' to erase,
No one could ever take your place.


[Chorus:]
Well I remember how it used to feel,
Back when our love was strong and real.
And I remember tears in your eyes,
As I looked at you and said goodbye.
All I want right now is to forget,
Every single thing that I regret,
And drown out these embers...but I remember.

It's yesterday again,
Here inside my mind.
And I can't find a way 
To leave your love behind.
I want to wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way.

Kenny Chesney,"Saw him sittin' on a sidewalk in Fresno...
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on.

About the tour he did and the deal he got.

Watchin' the tide roll in.

I'd went skinny dippin' with Jenny Carson that time she dared me to

I wish I woulda spent more time with my dad when he was alive

I wish I'd gone to church on Sunday morning when my grandma begged me to
But I was afraid to go
I wish I'd woulda listened when they said ""boy your gunna wish you hadn't""

Even if they could
Oooh but I would

There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad she could taste it
I should've bought it
But I didn't
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow trimed in blue's and green's
But I wouldn't let her
It wouldn't have hurt nothin'

Kenny Chesney,"Friday night butterflies,
Like clockwork they'd arrive...
A little chill and the October sky.
Nervous till the kickoff game,
Four quarters win or lose...
Spent Saturday's black and blue.
But it was what I love to do,
And it was more than just a game.

It was my life and it was fun.
Another season of my life is done.
Another race I'm glad I got to run.
Another chapter in my life, it's over.
No I'm never gonna feel like that again,
Time's rushin' by me like the wind,
Never be as young as I was then,
No I'm never gonna feel like that again.

Practice dancin' in my garage,
Two left feet and a white corsage.
Daddy let me borrow the Dodge,
Said, ""Don't bring her home on empty.""
Swung by and picked up Cindy Lou,
Took her to the prom for a dance or two,
Then we drove to the water blue
And that's where she kissed me.

No I'm never gonna feel like that again.

I got a call one July day,
Cindy Lou was in that way.
Had a big decision to make
And I couldn't take it lightly.
At first I thought of leavin' town
But I couldn't let our families down.
Now I'm out here throwin' this ball around
With a boy that looks just like me.

It's my life and it's sure fun.
Another season of my life's begun.
Another race I'm glad I get to run.

Workin' six days a week.
Wearin' holes in the soles
Of the shoes on my feet.
Been dreamin' of gettin' away
Since I don't know.
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

No shoes, no shirt, and no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.
The sun and the sand,
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,
No problems.

Want a towel on a chair
In the sand by the sea,
Want to look through my shades,
And see you there with me.
Want to soak up life for a while,
In laid back mode.
No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code

No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.

And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,

No problems.","No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"

She was born to see the world.
All I got is a picture she mailed me.
Barefoot in the snow white sand;
A bag of sea shells in her hand.
She finally found a paradise it seems...

On the coast of somewhere beautiful,
Trade winds blowin' through her hair,
Sunlight dancin' on the water,
And I wish I was there.
Don't know how I'm gonna find her,
All I know so far...
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful,
Runnin' with my heart.

Sometimes when the sun goes down
Shadows fall across this little town,
And I close my eyes and I drift away
To another place in another time,
When the world was ours and she was mine,
I dream of holdin' her again someday...

Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hopped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'

But we ain't learnin'
We're the same sad story that's a fact
One step up and two steps back

But he ain't singin'

But the church bells they ain't ringing

It's the same thing night on night
Who's wrong baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back

There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married

Kenny Chesney,"Lookin' back now well it makes me laugh,
We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch em burn.

Listenin' to our music just a little too loud,
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young, young

Talked a good game, we were right with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Singin' Silent Night with the palm trees a-blowing

Ooh, don't you think it's a pretty good plan?
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Well if you're thinkin' 'bout gettin' me a present this year
Let me put a bug in your cute little ear
How 'bout two tickets to a tropical shore
Where we don't have to wear these winter clothes anymore?
Instead of turkey we'll have mahi-mahi grillin'
And piña colada in the blender chillin'

Well everybody's praying for a Christmas of white
Come to think about it, that'll be all right
As long as it's sand and not snow on the ground
And every day our skin gets a little more brown

Then we'll string some lights in a coconut tree
I rub some oil on you and you can rub some on me

All I want for Christmas is a real good tan
I can see us baby, on the beach hand-in-hand
Rocking to and fro with the rhythm of the ocean
Baby won't you say you and me will be goin'?

Ooh, I can almost feel my toes in the sand
All I want for Christmas is a real good tan

Don't worry baby, we'll celebrate plenty
I'll buy you some shades and a brand-new bikini
We won't have to worry 'bout the holiday rush

Kenny Chesney,"Well, the news spread through Jerusalem, tonight a child is born
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and Angels blowin' horns
But in their golden halls the Pharasees
Scoffed and drank their wine
They said it's only Hebrew prophecy
We don't care and besides, He just a kid
That's all He is
One more pebble in the gravel, one more rumor in the rabble
How can He be king, he's just a kid

Well in no time He seen the world was knockin' on His door
Performed miracles and wonders they had never seen before
Soon the Pharasees stopped laughin
The silver sun was paid
And near the end He knelt down in the garden and He prayed, I'm just a kid

That's all I am
I'll need Your strength too see me through it
If it is Your will I'll do it
But how can I be king, I'm just a kid?

Now I think about the Baby and the Man at Christmas time
Of mothers, sons and fathers and children just like mine
About the power in unselfishness, love and sacrifice
The Gift that we were given and the price

And how the news spread through Jerusalem, tonight a child is born
There are shepherds fallin' to their knees, and angels blowin' horns
I wonder how on Earth the Pharasees, could scoff and drink their wine
And say He's only Hebrew prophesy
We don't care and besides He's just a kid

Kenny Chesney,"""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levy
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin' Me Baby""
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him

Kenny Chesney,"We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on top of the car
He drank beer out of a mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed.

A wide frame house in a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown
But we tried our best anyway.

We went to class just to pass the time
Back in '89.

We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet.

This old guitar taught me how to score
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more
About wantin' what you can't have.

Sweatshirts and flag football
Spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all
We never dreamed it wouldn't last.

Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's goin', where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it,
To the way that I see it,
To the way that I see it when I sit in that old blue chair

From that chair I've caught a few fish and some rays
And I've watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
I prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start

I've read a lot of books,
Wrote a few songs
Looked at my life where it's goin',where it's gone
I've seen the world through a bus windshield, but nothing compares
To the way that I see it, to the way that I see it,
To the way that I see it when I sit in
That old blue chair

That chair was my bed one New Year's Night
When I passed out from too much Malibu and diet
And woke up to a hundred mosquito bites,
I swear got 'em all sittin' right there
In that old blue chair

There's a blue rockin' chair
Sittin' in the sand
Weathered by the storms and well oiled hands",Old Blue Chair

Lock up the house pack up the station wagon
Make paradise our final destination

There ain't no time like the present they say
Lets cruise all the way down A1A
Put the top down and catch a few rays
Baby we'll be outta here

Anywhere you want to go
As long as its sunny weather
Let the time fly by I don't mind
As long as we're together

South of the border there's a place I know
Where James Taylor sang about Mexico
And the suns so hot we'll forget to go home
Baby we'll be outta here

Maybe drive to the country
Down to the lake see if the catfish are jumpin set our bait
And if we come up dry we'll just sleep in late
At least we'll be outta here

Kenny Chesney,"His old man was a rebel yeller. 
Bad boy to the bone he'd say, 
""Can't trust a colored feller""
And he'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin.
And he was raised to think like his dad, 
Narrow mind, full of hate,
On the road to nowhere fast,
Until the grace of god got in the way,
Then he saw the light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer,
And rose up a brand new man, and left the old one right there.

(Chorus)
Here's to the strong,
Thanks to the brave,
Don't give up hope,
Some people change.
Against all odds,
Against the grain,
Love finds a way,
Some people change.

She was born with her mothers habit,
Guess you could say it's in her blood,
She hates it that she's gotta have it,
She fills her glass up.
And she'd love to kill that bottle,
But all she could think about is a,
A better life, a second chance, 
And everyone she's lettin' down.

She throws that bottle down.

Thank god for those who make it.
Let them be the love.

Some people change.

Kenny Chesney,"All he could think about was I'm to young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I'm just a kid myself
How'm I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah...he loves that little girl.

Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she stumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls

He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future my everything
I love you, daddy goodnight
There goes my life

She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and fifteen pairs of shoes and his American express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood, said your good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the west coast

He cried

There goes my future, my everything
I love you

Are we're ever gonna get it right

Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer to
When I think about leaving I think about me

You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had all he could
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye

When I think about leaving I think about him
That little apartment cross town he's living in
Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other weekend
When I think about leaving oh I think about him

I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he walked out on her
And her mom when she was just a kid

When I think about leaving oh I think about her
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are you coming
Back
When I think about leaving I think about her

You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we got something
Special
When I think about leaving I think about us
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender way we touch,
All those nights we spent making love,
When I think about leaving oh I think about us

When I think about leaving I think again
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would rather be

Can goods scattered all the way to the curb.

So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing.
Western sky all turning red.
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said:

Anymore there ain't nothin' I swear man that I don't do.
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals.
Dancing backwards in high heels.
Just when it feels like I can't make it through.
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me.
I was gonna run the bank.
I was gonna run the map.
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath.
Back then you know I had this plan.
Before all of this reality set in.
Here comes life boy ready or not.

I'm stayin' here with some friends
And they've got lots of room

You can sell your paintings
On the sidewalk
And by a cafe where
I hope to be workin' soon

Please come to Boston
She said, ""No, boy you come home to me""

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy
Why don't you settle down?
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""

""I'm the number one fan
Of the man from Tennessee""

Please come to Denver to see the snowfall
Move up into the mountains
So far that we can't be found

And throw I love you echoes
Down the canyons
And then lie awake at night
'Til they come back around

Please come to Denver

And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
And of all the dreams

I've lost and found
And all that I ain't got
I need someone to cling to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to L.A. to live forever
A California life alone
Is just too hard to live

I live in a house that, looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars
That fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill

Please come to L.A.

Little bit of sun on my skin
A hammock, a book
Never gonna look back
Once my feet hit the sand
I've had it up to here with this rat race
Need a smile on my face

I want to go where I can lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star
And be as you are

Gettin' stuck sure would be easy
In this palm tree paradise
Ambition fades with every wave
For the finer things in life
Maybe I'll just hang around here
Go home later next year

I want stay down here, lighten up the load
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
Get this laying low off to a flying start
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon
Where you can be a tourist, a beach bum, or a star

And he was desperate to rearrange priorities
And he thought the sea would be the best place to be

Now he's an island boy

And he sees tourists come and go
With their pressed pants and camera case
Too much sun burned on their face
Now he watches the snow on CNN
With all of his dope-smokin' friends
Just look at the hell they must be in
Swears he won't go back again

Even though I know my way around
Didn't take me long until I found the devil
With just one word I knew his voice
Is the one I heard in every choice I made
Just trying to be a rebel
In a small town, in a small town

If you jumped off of our front porch
You'd land right where the Civil War was fought
And it's never been forgotten
It's twenty miles to the interstate
There's a Burger King and a Motel Eight
And the only thing between here and there is cotton

And Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me I just ran away
From a small town, from a small town

Sometimes it was heaven, sometimes hell
Kinda like church, kinda like jail
There's a water tower says 'Welcome to nowhere'
As soon as I could I was long gone
My jeans were torn and my hair was long
Now I can't believe I wanna go back there
To a small town, to a small town

Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me I just ran away
But I knew I'd come back some day
To a small town, to a small town
Oh to a small town, to a small town",In a Small Town
Kenny Chesney,"Drivin' down the road again
A highway that never ends
Takin' naps in my old car
Singin' in guitar bars
Killin' time with cafe queens
And truckers playin' slot machines
I meet a lot of wannabes
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me

Charlie runs the Produce Shack
Livin' in a van out back
Sellin' peas and homemade syrup
Cantaloupes and Elvis shirts
Braggin' on future plans
With whiskey breath and shaky hands
I meet a lot of wannabes
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me

Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes
To another one-night show
'Cause that's where I was born to be
Have guitar, will travel light
Here today and gone tonight
Playin' this lifetime lottery

Here's to faces I have seen
A carnival of those who dream
Rodeos seekin' fame
Table dancers I can't name
Willie T. in Abilene
Karaoke's all-time king
And every six string wannabe
Dreamin' big and livin' free like me

Wearin' wrinkled travelin' clothes
To another one-night show
'Cause that's where I was born to be
Have guitar, will travel light
Here today and gone tonight

Kenny Chesney,"The body's a temple; that's what we're told
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day, they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up; they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUVs
They pray for their babies, and they worry 'bout me

'Cause I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

I'm always runnin'
Son-of-a-gunnin'
I've had a good time, it's true
But the way I've been goin'
It's time that I toned it
Down just a notch or two

Oh yeah

Well, I'm living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

Yeah, I'm living in fast forward

Yeah, I still got some miles to go",Living in Fast Forward
Kenny Chesney,"Ain't nothing out here but me, the road and the radio
Looking for an exit and a song that I might know
Counting down the memories and adding up the miles
Searching for a feeling I ain't felt in a while

Clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:
The road and the radio

Spent the night in Carolina, got up early out of bed
Bought a Red Bull and a road map and a old Stones cassette
Setting my sights south bound, no reason or rhyme
Threw up a prayer just lookin', just lookin' for a sign

And some clarity and inspiration
Happiness is a destination that's hard to find
It may take some time
But in my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind
And I'll get there leanin' on some friends I know:
The road and the radio

In my mind there's something more
And I'll open up a brand new door
And find the strength to close the ones I left behind

Kenny Chesney,"Same ol' bedroom floor
Same ol' empty sheets
I hate this haunted bed
So down here's where I sleep

Tryin' to find a place
To hide what you have left
Some things never change
My heart hasn't yet

Well I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home
Can't somebody take me home

The hope that we had left
Wrapped around your ring
That river just rolled on by
When I watched it sink

Well I don't wanna go out tonight
Yeah but I can't be alone
Standing underneath this broke streetlight
Can't somebody take me home

Kenny Chesney,"Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on forty nine
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says ninety three
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimmin' hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

The more things change
The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

Two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime

Kenny Chesney,"South of the border
American dollars
Take you a long, long way
Beach side bungalow
Sand between your toes

And the heart that you broke will soon be a joke
As soon as he and I meet

Kenny Chesney,"Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

It ain't fair you died too young
Like a story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no one could take your place
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today

Would you see the world, would you chase your dreams
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
I know it might sound crazy

It ain't fair you died too young
Like a story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no one could take your place
Sometimes I wonder who you'd be today

Kenny Chesney,"Every now and then I get a little lost
My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby, you save me

It's hard lovin' a man, that's got a Gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it; I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say, to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me, like nobody else
And I thank God you do

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby, you save me

I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love

When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby, you
Baby, you save me

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker comin' undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby, you save me",You Save Me
Kenny Chesney,"She's thinkin' about what her kids are doing
Five miles away it's almost time for bed
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story
And in the mirror, she paints her lips bright red

She wishes she could call and say she loves them
But the boss man says no calls go out or in
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty
If she didn't have to take it off again

[Chorus:]
She's dancin' for the groceries
She's dancin' for the rent
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday
Smiling while she dances, is the price she has to pay

They tell her in this job there is no future
So get it while you can cause looks don't last
There's money in those pockets for the taking
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast

The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall
The business men stare at the single mother
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall

[Chorus]

Someday she'll have a house out in the country
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn
And no one will ever know what it was she did before
But she just heard the DJ say ""you're on""
And the lights come up and they play her song

She's dancin' for the groceries
She's dancin' for the rent
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday
Smiling while she dances, smiling while she dances
Is the price she has to pay

It's the price she has to pay",Dancin' for the Groceries
Kenny Chesney,"Sometimes they're in a bottle
Sometimes a pair of high heal shoes
Some come rolled in paper
Some have six strings and only play the blues 
Once you meet the devil
There's no way he'll let you be
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

Skeletons in closets
Ghost underneath the bed
They hide out in pictures
And in words better left unsaid
They hang around like perfume
And haunt me like an ancient melody
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

[Chorus:]
There's things I can?t leave alone
'Cause they won't leave me alone
What I want ain't what I need
Still I reach for the things I crave
Better try to runaway
Maybe I'm afraid of being free
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

So roll one up and light it
Pickup my old guitar
I'm playing crossroads
Drinkin' whiskey from the mason jar
There's heartache at my front door
Says she needs my company
When I'm not chasing demons
There's demons chasing me

Kenny Chesney,"I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is""

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first""
Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your ""better half""
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

So I've been tryin' to slow it down
I've been tryin' to take it in
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife

Woke up by each other's side
It got a little crazy last night

Last thing I remember
I told the bartender
Mix rum and whatever you have
First one drink, then two then I woke up with you
So I know things can't be all that bad

Kenny Chesney,"She played third base on a softball team
Had a pretty good arm and a real nice swing
I was workin' part time out at Gentry's farm
Had a thing for a girl in a uniform
After the game she was mine, young, wild and free
Yeah old Mr. Gentry was pretty cool he said ""son, I know where I'd be
And what I'd say if it was me""

One of these days, I'm gonna have to grow up
Have to get real jobs and be adult some day, just not today
Have to worry about things out of our control
Like kids, love and money and gettin' old someday, just not today
Just not today

Had a rope swing hanging from a sycamore tree
By a deep little spot on white sand creek
Used to walk barefoot down a little dirt path
We'd throw out the beach towels and lay on our backs
Had four wheel drive trucks parked up in the shade
With those speakers blasting we never knew how much we really had it made
Without a care in the world we'd say

Have to show some maturity, responsibility
Pay the ole fiddler, face reality
Maybe tomorrow the older and wiser we'll be

And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel

A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor

It was mine all mine
And I never wanted nothing more

I took Katie down by the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line

And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
I'd never been that far before

Blue eyes staring through me
Baby, what are you doing to me
You (never felt this before, it's all brand new to me, never known anyone) scare me
You (I'm doing what I said I would never do, too late to stop it now) scare me

I still dream about that look on a woman's face
That says I love you through the good, the bad, the sunshine or the rain
Sometimes I wish, I had someone to share my life with
Maybe I'll have a wife and kids
Maybe someday

Maybe I could have a son
Play football in the back yard
Or take my daughter fishing
And when she turned fifteen
Teach her how to drive a car
When I grow old and they've all left home
I wanna lay beside my wife
Talk about the old times, remember all the good times

See can you make it on the wild ride (wild ride)

As she sasheyed through the door

Fell in love in the heat of passion
Oh, but passion has it's price
Under all that beauty
Beat a heart that was made of ice

Kenny Chesney,"When I was a boy

Four houses down from me
Was a family with an only child
She was the only girl
In this whole world that can make me smile

Down the road
I made up reasons to go
Down the road

Somewhere inside of me
There was something she took a liking to
I asked her to marry me
She said she really wanted to

Down the road
To see what life's gonna hold
Down the road

Her momma wants to know
If I'm washed in the blood or just in the water
Her daddy wants to know
If I make enough to take his daughter

Down the road
Before he could let her go
Down the road

Now down the street from here
There's an engineer with an only son
And our baby girl says
She believes that he is the only one

Down the road

Her momma wants to know
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water
And I want to know
That he makes enough to take my daughter

Dwell on the wreckage as it smolders in the rain
But not me, I'm alive.

And today, you know, that's good enough for me
Breathing in and out's a blessing, can't you see

Kenny Chesney,"It was early one morning
Playa del Carmen
That's when I first met Jose
He had a 12 foot Schooner
A 3 foot cooler
Full of the catch of the day
And he was wrinkled from grinning
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said ""Gracias senor"", when I paid him too much for
All of the Snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing
In the best broken Spanish I knew
I said I make a good living
Back home where I'm from
He smiled and said Amigo me too

He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife
I pray every night
I can do it all over again

Somewhere over Texas
I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I've gathered
From climbing that ladder
Didn't make much sense anymore
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire
They call it paying the price
So that one day in life
I'll have what I need to retire

And just fish
And play my guitar
And laugh at the bar with my friends
And go home to my wife
And pray every night
I can do it all over again

And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made
When the truth is I'm really just dying
To live like Jose

And just fish
Play my guitar
Laugh at the bar with my friends
Go home to my wife
Pray every night
I can do it all over again

Like an old scooter slipping slowly to it's grave,
Like ghosts of old sailors caught somewhere in time,
Like a lone palm watch the world unwind

Nowhere to go and nowhere to be,
""Trinidad Charlie"" on a stool next to me,
Reading his book bout the ""have"" and ""have-nots,""

And one by one we slide from reality,
With nowhere to go, and no where to be

There's jerk chicken grilling on the grill.
Sure feels good for some time to be still.
Even if its only for a little while.

A restlessness that I can't seem to tame

There's a hurricane that's raging through my blood
I can't find a way to calm the sea
Maybe I'll find someday the waters aren't so rushed
Right now they've got the best of me
And oh, it's been a long, long time
Since I had real peace of mind
So I'm just going to sit right here
In this old chair till this storm rolls by.

Oh, maybe it's just the way I am
Maybe I won't ever change
So I'm just going to sit right here
In this old chair and just soak up the rain.

Kenny Chesney,"Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about 1 I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears

But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here

Kenny Chesney,"Some folks livin' in the country can't wait to get in their pickup trucks and go to town
There's people livin' in a penthouse dying to get out in the sticks and ride around
There's a man up on a mountaintop who wants to go down and breathe the salt air by the shore
There's a guy on an island he ain't smilin' and don't want to be on an island anymore

There's a lady locked in a love affair wouldn't care if she was single again
There's a lonely soul who's only goal is to get that golden ring upon their hand
In the middle of nowhere there's a nobody tryin' to get that 15 minutes of fame
Someplace there's a superstar thinkin' Lord if I could only change my name

Round and round and round and round we go
Why we can't be satisfied I don't know

I don't know

There's a young man wishin' he could grab the hands of a time and speed em' up a year or two
There's and old man wishin' he could just go back and stop the clock and hang on to his youth
There's a stoner on the sidewalk wishin' he could just get straight for a day
There's a man in a suit and tie thinkin' gettin' high might be a better way

Round and round and round and round we go
Why we can't be satisfied I don't know

From the day we're born it seems like it never stops
Why do we always want somethin' we ain't got

Aww we ain't got

Round and round and round and round we go

Kenny Chesney,"A Saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
She said it was her first time to see the sea
Helping her climb across those jetty rocks
Was the first time I touched her hand

The rain and the way that felt never let up all week
By Thursday I knew everything about her
And God, the last day I didn't wanna leave without her

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Time was like the tide, it came and went
That old pier ran clear out into the mist
My mind plays back that Tuesday night
Again and again, and again

I taste that saltwater taffy on her lips
And Wednesday morning snuck in through the window
We just laid there and listened to the waves come and go

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand

Moments with her, now they're all a blur
Except for every second and every word
Every drop of rain, every single grain of sand

The sidewalks, the streets were soaked
The sky was gray but you should've seen her face
Shining like that lighthouse through all the rain
And the way she called my name

I've lived those seven days a thousand times
Those seven days a thousand times

Seven days a thousand times
A thousand times

Don't it make you feel mean, Jean?
Don't it make you feel ashamed of yourself?

Kenny Chesney,"If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

""I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.""

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

Kenny Chesney,"There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house
Where Mama used to measure us
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised
But that ain't where I grew up

See, I gained a little on Father Time
The summer my Granddaddy died
The first time I saw Mama cry
Man, that sure was tough

Felt like I put on a few years
Watching Daddy wipe her tears
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud
That's where I grew up

My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank
Getting a head start on twenty one
That's the place that made me feel just like a man
But that ain't where I grew up, no

See I gained a little on Father Time
That night I crossed that center line
I bet I rolled a dozen times

Next thing I knew I was waking up upside down
Praying ""God, just get me out""
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck
Hey, that's where I grew up

You learn as you go, that's how you grow

See, I gained a little on Father Time
When me and her, had our first big fight
I said some things, I made her cry
She packed all her stuff

The boy in me said let her go
But the man in me said pull her close
It was time to find out which one I was
Standing in a doorway holding on to love

That's where I grew up
Oh, that's where I grew up",Where I Grew Up

One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy

Kenny Chesney,"I couldn't wait to turn sixteen
And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
Was all I could think about

A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor
Five hundred dollars
It was mine all mine
And I never wanted nothing more

I took Katie down by the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line

And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
I'd never been that far before

And I never wanted nothin' more
No I never wanted nothin' more

And I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

But I told them that I thought it through
Well Katie laughed and my momma cried
When they heard me say I do

Her little ring was a little thing
But it was all that I could afford
Now shes mine all mine
Till the day I die

And I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front
And I got down on my knee

Right then and there I swear
I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah good God Almighty

I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you

And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're goin' far

I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby

Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,
Were you even here at all?

I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby

Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say

One is one too many, one more is never enough

Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again

'Cause you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in

'Cause you and tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough

Never enough

When the old battery gets running low
I'm a sucker for the sand and sea, yea
If I had my way, hey I'd always be

Way up high in a coconut tree
Layin' low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

Not to green, not too brown
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece
And you can do alright if you ain't afraid to be

High in a coconut tree
Layin' low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High in a coconut tree

Yeah, there's less stress and the world's alright
It's a different point of view

Kenny Chesney,"Your spirit will live here forever
The sea will echo your gypsy soul
You will always bring us together, this much I know
Oh, your smile was as big as this island
You could drown in your eyes of blue
You were friend of a friend and someone, I'm glad I knew

I'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die never die
You will never die never die

I hope time can be our healer, maybe time can be a friend
Still I'm a strong believer, someday we'll see you again
Where the sun is on our faces and the wind is at our back
Sailing south to our favorite places, where the water's calm and flat

'Til then we'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die never die

Our circle of friends, we're sad that you're gone
We celebrate your life with stories and a song
Somehow you will keep us strong

And we'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive

Let our inhibitions run

Left behind so many traces of my soul
I carry all these voices with the ringing in my ears
Some girl's tears and the rhythm of the road
Sometimes my life takes more than I can give

Where no one's around
But the silence and the sound
Of ""Three Little Birds"" for company
I got a sip of something strong
A secondhand ""Old Man and the Sea""

God knows I love my life and I thank Him every night

And the struggle and the strife, what's wrong and what's right

I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely 'cause it's not the same

Living like pirates out among the stars

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart

Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around.
Moonshine, that's where they make it,
Put it in a jug, make you wanna get naked.
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line.
Stepped down in the sun, with my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able
Don't know what makes you say ""What the hell""
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something 'bout her makes you just wanna dance
And she loves to dance

I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kinda blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world

I remember back home 'neath the big ol' moon
Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good

It's called the blood of the blessed land
If your faith ain't strong enough child
You might wind up dead
Praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

Now Reverend Jones he struts some dances
While the guitar plays amazing grace
He testifies in tongues of fire
With tears of joy running down his face
He ain't sure, and we ain't sure
Exactly what he said
But praise the Lord and pass me a copperhead

You won't find many hypocrites
That will take the chance on getting bit
But a true believer can survive
Rattlesnakes and cyanide

Now I'll bring you home that deadly viper
Keep the holy spirit in your mind
You might lose your concentration
That serpent's surely bound to strike
Either way you won't forget

I learned to fight, keep roads tied, and not chill
Never did change, stayed strange, hopped a train
My first chance I got out of Smallville
Life has it's way of movin' you on, don't it?

My first stop was a pawn shop
Dropped a pretty penny for a cheap Fender with a song in it
I had a quick right hand, and an old band
I thought good friends would make a good band
Life has it's way of provin' you wrong, don't it?

And I've been right and I've been wrong
Somewhere in between for so long
Live the night, miss the light, and I've been shown it
Life has it's way of keepin' you strong, don't it?

So there I was, a long way from nowhere
Fried mind, spare time and a blank stare
I was just numb enough not to feel a thing
After all we didn't share a set of rings
Besides, how bad could it be!
She never found out I'd never come clean
Life has it's way of leadin' you on, don't it?

And I've been right and I've been wrong

Hope none for patty and loveless,
November of ninety-three

And the crowd was really small
He'd say I was a scared kid,
If this bus could talk

Some nights we'd dance with the devil
Some nights we'd pray to the Lord
Between vibrant passes and rubber arena glasses
He was never really bored

We were starry eyed dreamers,
Bouncing off the wall
And all the stories he could tell,
If this bus could talk

He'd sing of pool halls in Texas
And have a corn dog in county fair
Girls that we made cry,
Some crowds that didn't care

And Bobby road us down in Bama
He kept rocking through it all
All the stories he could tell,
If this bus could talk

Late night conversations,
Full of drunk philosophy
On politics and religion,
Football and family

The lovers that we missed,
And the lovers that we lost
All the secrets he could share
If this bus could talk

He'd seen Virginia Beach,
Caught in a hurricane
He roads I wish I never met
But he ain't naming names

We learned the code of the road at the grizzly rose
When we had a bone
All the stories he could serve
If this bus could talk

Many years of summers,
And I hope it never ends
Been down so many highways,
Full of twists and turns and bends

We caught lightning in a bottle,
Somehow we survived it all

I hit that water back with a monster stack
And a kick, kick, kick drum kicking my butt

Just across town
There's a lone hillbilly playing Stardust Willy

So I'm heading on out the door

I knew I'd be missing
The feel of the wind on my face

Of wondering what happened
Too busy taking all the blame

It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kind of making eyes at me

And they're all too high to be bringing 'em down
If they ask about you
I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

They'll be plenty of time for what if's and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

'Cause the sun's too bright,
The sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking about you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away

There's only one thing left to do

Gonna take a deep breath and hold it in
Twirl you around 'til my head spins

Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn 'til it's gone

And this feels way too right
It'd been way too long to start
And it's sure worth drinking to

Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love

You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru
Kenny Clarke,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.

To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Kenny Clarke,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Kenny Colman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Kenny Colman,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you",Where Do You Start?

Not a real one, just a dream

You're just what I wanted

Paradise to live

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Kenny Davern,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

Will come back to me

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn

Kenny Drew,"Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning
This need that you and you alone create

Kenny Drew,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Kenny Drew,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

You used to do
I grow lonely

I walk along with you

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Kenny Drew,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Kenny Drew,"I sit alone in the golden daylight,
But all I see is a silver sky,
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

The evening mist melts away,
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Kenny Drew,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day

Kenny Drew,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Kenny Drew,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Kenny Drew,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Kenny Drew,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

After it brought my lover near

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"

Then the world discovers as my book ends

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.

Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings

Hey why'all get up get up it's a one night stand
Here I come again with my rhyming slang
I said ride to the rhythm as I flip this sound
Flip this sound we're gonna move around

Mis-Teeq we're coming back again
Love of the music inside your membrane
Yo, I'm gonna burn you with my lyrical flame
Start the game
Come follow me it's time to play

Now don't you get the wrong impression
It's just a dance
I'm with my girlfriends hanging out
To mislead wasn't my intention
Nothing more to say

Hand on my hips as we start to dip
Close range, full clip

Kenny G,"One more time saying goodbye to love.
And wondering why, so I only
Hope that I'm learning to make the right choices.
I keep hearin' voices sayin'...

I'll be alright; it's just another heartbreak baby. 
I'll be alright, soon as I forget your face. 
I'll be alright; I'll just write another love song. 
I'll be alright; Lord, just get me through the night. 
 
Some hearts get so used to feelin' this way, 
But that's not for me. 
Oh, I only know things do happen for all the right reasons. 
That's why I'm believin' ...

Can't say we didn't try to make it last.
How we tried!
Once the feelin' changes, it's just no use.
 'Cause love just turns into lies.

Oh, my love is a love that you'll feel forever.
So don't be afraid.

I heard he sang it from his heart
When I found out thought I would die
Because that lullaby was mine
I heard he sealed it with a kiss
He gently kissed her cherry lips
I found that so hard to believe
Because his kiss belonged to me

How could an angel break my heart
Why didn't he catch my falling star
I wish I didn't wish so hard
Maybe I wished our love apart
How could an angel break my heart

I heard her face was white as rain
Soft as a rose that blooms in May
He keeps her picture in a frame
And when he sleeps he calls her name
I wonder if she makes him smile
The way he used to smile at me
I hope she doesn't make him laugh
Because his laugh belongs to me

Why didn't he catch may falling star

I reach out to touch you
Feel you by my side
And I reach, and I reach,

Will I ever get to feel you again, again

Just one more time
One more moment
To take you in my arms
One more chance
One more kiss
Before I wake to find you gone
One more time
Before I have to face another bad day,
And my heart breaks again

It's only a dream
But it's all so real
Don't want it to end
But I know it will
So I pray, and I pray
Every night I'm on my knees
Begging for the chance to see you
Again, again

One more moment
To take you in my arms

Kenny G,"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay;
Remember Christ, our Savior,
Was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessed morn;
That which His Mother Mary,
Did nothing take in scorn.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father,
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Fear not,"" then said the Angel,
""let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior
Of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy",God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen

To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Kenny G,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Kenny G,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Fly Me to the Moon/You Make Me Feel So Young
Kenny G,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Kenny G,"Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power

So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you baby
If I ain't got you baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?

Me alejaste de ti
Why la sal de este mar se seco
No se puede salvar
Lo que ya se quedo
Si en la piel esta escrito el final

Fuiste el unico amor en que crei
Pero el tiempo mato lo que te di
Tu tambien estas triste
Porque duele oir la verdad

Es hora de decir adios
No queda otra salida, termino
Abrazame en silencio, lo siento
Dejemoslo pasar, digamonos adios

Tu why yo sin amor
Dos en la obscuridad
Compartiendo tanta soledad
Ya no hay a donde ir
Aceptemos que todo acabo de una vez

Te propongo olvidarnos del ayer
Separarnos ahora sin llorar
Aunque sea muy triste
Es mejor oir la verdad

Es hora de decir adios
No queda otra salida, termino
Abrazame en silencio, lo siento
Dejemoslo pasar, digamonos adios

Te perdi, lo se
Nada queda ya
Solo las cenizas de un recuerdo
Tienes que seguir
Tengo que seguir
Why buscar consuelo en otros besos
Siempre hay un talvez
Siempre habra un despues
Sobreviviras, sobrevivire

Ya no es tiempo de finjir
No podemos ignorar

Every single moment that we spend apart.
I need you around for every day to start;
I haven't left you alone.

There's something about you, it's there in your eyes,
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find.
All this time away is killing me inside -
I need your love in my life.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

We fought in a battle, but nobody won,
And left ourselves a mountain to overcome.
You can't turn away: the past is said and done;
I need us to carry on.

I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

You never thought would work before.

You can always give 'em some more.

Unless you're here to share with me.
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
'Cause you're always there in my dreams.

I want to fall with you again.

And even longer ago, when we both were young
But it's nice to know, that as we grow old
That our love still shines like gold

And you, you were my lover and girl, my best friend
And its crazy I would go through the ups and downs

Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California

He left you wanting and with nowhere to turn
You hid your feelings, kept a smile on your face
You fooled some people but not me

But now you're living alone, pretending that's what you want
When really loneliness grows
Before you give up on love, try one more time 'cause I know
That I can restore your hope

I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness

You say you're moving slow 'cause you have been hurt
I understand 'cause when you go through you learn
I'll take each step with you to make sure it's right
I know it's gonna work this time

But don't begin to compare, sincerity and intent
While holding on to the past
I'll love you body and soul, commit my life just to show
Why don't you give me a chance?

I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist
I'll bring you joy and so much happiness, love and tenderness
No girl, you can't resist

If you just open your heart to me
And let me show you how good true love can be
When you give your all
There's nothing in the world that can ever
No never tear us apart

Stuck right in the middle of two broken hearts

You're afraid to give yourself another start

You deserve better

I'll be your everything
I'll give what you need

Just keeps right on giving till it fills you up

I'm gonna hold you
Let me console you

How could the feeling be gone?

Where did our love go?
How could we just let it fade away?
To me it's all a mystery
That's left my heart in so much pain

Can't stop looking at your picture
Reminiscing on the way it used to be
Still holding on to yesterday
With thoughts I can't seem to put away

Could someone else be loving you
And erasing your memory?

I don't want to get over you
If I did, it wouldn't be tonight
If loving you is all I can do
I wanna do that for the rest of my life

Kenny Lattimore,"I'm coming to terms with how I'm feeling
Putting my heart out on the line
My emotions say this is serious, but do you agree?
Or am I living a fantasy?

Every time I see you with another man
You always say he's just a friend
Thought that I could take it, but this heart of mine is breaking
It's harder now to face it, I don't want to understand it

Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free
Girl in my mind you're all I need
And baby I've been no good at make believe

Maybe somebody did you wrong
Or even you heard this all before
So you hesitate, are you afraid? Or is this a game?
I want to know, I'm tired of wondering

But girl if my timing just ain't right
Then we've got to move on with our lives
But tell the truth, you really want me too, there's nothing I can do
To convince you this is right

Can you pretend you don't love me
Just tell me now, I'll set you free

And I can't, I don't want to go back to living without you, no

Kenny Lattimore,"Had so much to give you, had so many plans
For our future happiness, isn't that the role of a man
I knew that I could provide everything you need
All I wanted was a little time, then to you I could commit

So, you waited on me believing in all my dreams
I didn't think I'd have to learn in the worst way

Why wait till tomorrow, you got a good thing right now
Baby, 'cause tomorrow may not ever come around

You weren't too demanding, never asked for much
Didn't even mind the struggle as long as it was all about us
You wanted my mind, hey, my body and soul
But I told you to hold on, I'm still working some things out on my own

So, you waited another year despite the pain and all your tears
I wasn't sensitive enough to think you had an option

She'll wait till tomorrow, how could I have been so wrong?
Surely cause tomorrow, my, my sweet lady was gone

Now I'm living my dreams, but it ain't nothing cause you're not with me
I'm so all alone, it wasn't even worth it, no

Waiting till tomorrow, I had a good thing then
Baby, but tomorrow ain't never gonna come around again

Missin' you baby, where are you, baby?

Kenny Lattimore,"Trial separation, many days and nights
I sat and thought about our plight
And what I think is maybe that we need a change
Though sometimes you make me feel I'd rather be alone

We've got too much to throw it all away
We tried talking it all out, even gone around the world
But that didn't make it better
Tell me how do we save what matters?

Maybe we should try separating
'Cause it ain't working, baby
(Baby)
You and me being so close all the time

Maybe by separating
We can take a good look at saving
Love that it took us so long to find

Maybe where we're at is the result of moving fast
You see it's so hard to tell when you're in love
But looking back on what has happened since back then
I wonder if that's really what it was

We're leaving out a complex situation
We can't deny the way I feel and you feel for me
Maybe we're just too close to see, oh

Maybe we should try separating
'Cause it ain't working, baby
('Cause it ain't working out)
You and me being so close all the time

(Maybe we're just too close to see)
Maybe by separating we can take a good look at saving
(You and me)
Love that it took us so long to find

Oh, ooh, what are we gonna do?

Maybe we should try separating
(Me and you babe)
'Cause it ain't working, baby, baby
You and me being so close all the time
(Maybe we're just to close all the time)

Maybe by separating
We can take a good look at saving
Love that it took us so long to find

Girl, we've got too much
We've come too far to say goodbye
Let's step back take a look
And maybe then we'll realize what we had, baby
What we have

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice
It's turning
While my guitar gently weeps

While every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

Look at you all

Who saw you stumble baby?
Who broke your fall?
Who gave you something out of nothing at all?
Who is the one for you to turn to...
When you're feeling low?
Who's always been there for you?
Darling you know

Who's gonna turn your back on...
All that we had?
And who had the good times
Should outweigh the bad
Who took the vow that that they would be there
til death do us part?
Who's here slowly dying...
cuz your breaking my heart?
You know

-Chorus-
I gave my love and it was from my heart
I can't figure out just why you tore it apart
Why does it have to be this way?
I can't figure it out baby
I wanna know who's gonna love you like I do?
... and whose gonna be there holding you now?

Who can I turn to when I'm feeling so blue?
Who can I run to?
There's no me without you
Who's gonna be by your side?
Since you walked right out my life
I can't sleep at night
I keep toss and turning
and one one can you tell me who?

I guess I knew that you weren't satisfied
I tried to push those thoughts right out of my mind
I guess this happens...
when you don't deal with the pain
But if you come on back this way
I'll give you my everything again

And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.

Kenny Lattimore,"Nothing like a woman
For me to hold and kiss
Making love to her mind and body
I didn't think I could fall like this
Where my mind would be captured
By the thought of just keeping her satisfied
And I know she's mine
Now I don't want nothing else

Nothing like a man to love me
And I'm the woman of his dreams
And I know he just ain't talking, nah nah
He knows me intimately

And he knows just how to make me smile
And he knows he's mine

Kenny Lattimore,"If everyday could be like
Waking up to your smile
And tasting your sweets lips
To put my day in motion
But I don't always recognize you
When you wear the pain you've been through
And I compete against a past
And learn it's more than an ocean

I'm not afraid of work
Even through the worst
Baby I'm staying with you
It's gonna be worth that I love you
Everybody knows that it's still good
(Life's been crazy, but I know baby)
Baby it's so good
(Good and bad times, cause you are mine)
(Our love, our love) Is still good
(Our love, our love) so good

Sometimes I don't know how to steer it
Can't really say that I've been fearless
But we've got too much invested
It's only fair that we're destined
(I don't want nobody but you)
(Big and strong when we go through)
On the other hand you still know you've got my devotion

It's been 10 years and I can't believe that my baby's home
I can even recall the day that you came along
All the years that we dated baby, then I made the call
And I brought you a cla**ic rock like the 80's songs
We the unbreakable perfect couple, he made us strong
Who would've ever predicted that I take a fall
You could've packed up and taken off
But instead you stuck with me through the greatest storm
And that's love, man the rain clouds
Didn't have a rule 'till you thought of how we exchanged vows
Yeah we faced trials, by the grace of God
Still good, now great, now real talk

I'm not afraid of work
Even through the worst
Baby I'm staying with you
It's gonna be worth that I love you
Everybody knows that it's still good

Baby it's so good
(Good and bad times, cause you are mine)
(Our love, our love) Is still good

If you'll be smart
Don't let a traveling man take your heart

Take my advice
Don't let it start
You'll think you're different from the rest
You'll try to do your part
Until he breaks your heart

Lunch for the lonely
Looking at picture postcards of someone else's scene
Somehow they don't seem real
The sea's too green

Somebody calls her
Giving out information
About the boy on the moon
Suddenly it's all too much
To be told
What she already knows

If you'll be wise
If you'll be smart
Don't let a traveling man take your heart
Take my advice
Don't let it start
Because you've been told too many times


If you'll be wise
If you'll be smart
Don't let a traveling man take your heart
Take my advice
Don't let it start
Because you've been told too many times

If you'll be wise
If you'll be smart
Don't let a traveling man take your heart
Take my advice
Don't let it start
Because when he comes and needs a friend
He'll do it all again

Better be smart
He's breaking your heart
Find you another lover
Better be wise
And open your eyes
This time",If You Be Wise
Kenny Loggins,"Seven-eleven he rolled
And all his life was a golden gamble
You'd see him reeling it in when the odds were high
Something supernatural, a charlatan, a mastermind
Or some lucky lady's design

Oh, what the devil, it's fun
His lady luck was his one companion
And by the silver and gold
His heart had been bought and bound
But he chanced to fall in new love
He kissed her and he cut the tie
And kissed his lucky lady goodbye

Oh, spin your wheel of fortune
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice
Are you with me in love
Like you've been with me in life
If I leave you for a lover
Would you leave me far behind

You should've known from the start
She'd take no part in a love triangle
You have to be her's alone
And go it on your own
Because if you've found a new love
Lady Luck is gonna step aside
So kiss your lucky lady goodbye

Spin your wheel of fortune
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice
Are you with me in love
Like you've been with me in life?
If I leave you for an hour
Would you leave me far behind?

Seven-eleven he rolled
And all his life was a golden gamble
You'd see him reeling it in when the odds were high

Or some jealous lady
Kiss your lucky lady goodbye
Don't pass this way again, goodbye
Don't pass this way again, goodbye",Lady Luck

Come into my room again
Broken window pane
Now reminds me I'm alive

Could it be right
Giving up, my darling
I'll wait for you now
To remind me why I've gone

How I love to write
Songs that have no answers
Oh, there's nothing on my mind
That I want to let go of

Letting it go on pretending
Everything has its way of ending
And I'm a loner

Wonder when I'll see a change in weather
Something's getting tangled up again
And I can't find an end

Can't let it go on returning
I've given everything that the harlequin boy can find
And I'm tired of trying
I'd rather leave than tell lies

Let it free my love to fly

Lying only breaks their hearts
And tears their lives apart

Even if I lie to little babe
I know she'll never leave me
She'll stay by my side

Tell me why do the people say
She ain't loving you anyway
So while you keep believing it brother
She'll keep making her time
Right before your eyes
Tell me why they gotta lie

In my eyes a revelation
In her arms the fascination
Of a friend

I've been making like a fool

Tell me why
Why is it true?

Tell me why do people lie?

Tell me why
Why do they lie?
Oh, why do they lie?
Tell me, tell me why

No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night;
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
Oh I'm just a friend.
That's all I've ever been.
Cause you don't know me.

For I never knew the art of making love,
Though my heart aches with love for you.
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by.
A chance that you might love me too.

You give your hand to me,
And then you say, ""Goodbye.""

Kenny Loggins,"From the time that I wake to the time that I rise, she's a lover and so am I
But the lady loves her passion more than me
When I'm under her spell, then I know very well, how her magic can mystify
And the lady leaves her lovers in ecstasy
She's young, but she's wise, and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance
Is as much as a man can see
But she'll never really love any more than any other lover in her life
And you'll come to know the devil in Angelique
For a moment it seems I'm a part of her dreams
And she loves like she's hypnotized
While she hides inside the man she's made of me
And then just when I've found her, her visions surround her
And I'll never fill her eyes, but I wonder who in hell the young girl sees
And she moans, and she sighs, and you search inside her eyes
But all you find is a man who can never be
And you wonder if she'll ever discover that the devil could never set her free
She's young, but she's wise, and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance
Is as much as any man can see
And you'll never really lose any more than any other lover has lost in her life

And you'll come to know the devil in Angelique
And you'll learn to love the devil",Angelique

Kenny Loggins,"Here's a sweet September morning, there's the sense of Autumn on the rise
He steps into the wind and sadly sighs
""Why does it always seem to be, there's a cold December wind in front of me?""
The more he fills his empty evenings
The less he feels that there's a chance to find
Something that can bring a peace of mind
Is there a place where you can go?
A little something you should know to turn the tide to your favor?

[Chorus:]

Wait a little while to welcome what you're after
Give it the time to find its way to you
And soon as you no longer try, you'll turn and find it standing by your side
Come and get it, when you let it, it'll come to you

When I run short on inspiration, I best recall what I've known all along
'N I remember sweet September's song, there never really has to be
A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore

Just forget it and wait a little while, while, while
Wait a little while, everything will come to you in time
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time
Wait a little while - every little thing's gonna come to you in time

Kenny Loggins,"He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realized
It never really was
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As she rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go
But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all keeps sending him 
Somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe
There's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere, she will return
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As she rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

In the middle of a dream
To an unfamiliar scene
Wonder what I fell into
Who knows why
People look for alibis
In a passing stranger's eyes
What am I supposed to do
So tonight
Tell her that you love her tonight
The only way to know is to try
tonight
Give it half a chance
And the glow
From the bathroom down the hall
Lights a mirror on a wall
Where a stranger stares at me.
""Hello, stranger,
Where you been?
Do you still remember when?
Well, every heartache has an end
'N maybe yours is on the way""

And you won't need yesterday
Beside you
See yourself in love again
And believe in the arms you're in
Tonight.

Evening ember glow
And you're wishing you could see
How far it flows
Rolling on to an endless sea
You'd be well on your way
If you could only set sail.

But dreams can drift away
And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision
If the embers flicker out?
Don't let it slip from view

The horizons are waiting
Your river is fading

[Chorus:]
So keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night

And believe the sun
Will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
But for tonight
Just keep the fire burning bright

I will never need to ask
""What have I done?""
Comes a moment when it's clear
There's only one.
Oh, whatever you need of me
I've made up my mind
I'll give you more than you've asked for

And there are those who can foresee
Where we will go
All the future...
I don't really want to know
Only that you'll be here with me.

Kenny Loggins
(This Is It)

The many times you've learned the lines
That love has spoken
So easily you love to leave
Your heart's unbroken
You've opened up a hundred eyes
And given them a point of view
Now think about the times you knew
And hold them up to me and you

Love has come of age

You close your eyes and
Fantasize a lost horizon
A memory, a gentle breeze for love
To ride in,
But in your dreams you turned arouind
And stumbled on a Shangri-la,
You'll never be along anymore,
'Cause brother now you've gone too far

Love has come of age

I'll stop by by tomorrow
I'll stop by by tonight
I'll stop by by morning. Momma
It's alright.

If a gigolo's what you're after
You'll have to hold on tight
Bye bye bye, later, baby
Make it, make it right

The first rays of sunlight

Whistling in the sycamores

And when the lady loves you

And let your feelings show

And she, never will leave
Always these memories will stay with me
