Dave Barker,"Outside my window
A robin builds a nest
At last, winter's gone away to rest.
Once again the leaves have returned to the trees.
I can just feel that soft summer breeze.
There's magic in the air
Winter's disappeared
It's summer
Children will be playing in the park
Days will be longer till dark 
Nights will be cool
With star-filled sky
A perfect setting for a girl and a guy
There's magic in the air
Everywhere, in the summer
Don't you know it's summer time
And the livin' is easy, so easy
Everybody sing summer time
Now that summer's here
There'll be millions of things to do
Vacation near a farm
Whatever pleases you
Summer is the happiest season of them all
So everybody get together 
And have yourself a ball
There's magic in the air
Everywhere in the summer
There's magic in the air
Everywhere in the summer

It's summer time
It's summer",It's Summer
Dave Barker,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.",Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)
Dave Barnes,"When you say you love me
It's something I can feel
Your words like fire 
Melt my heart of steel
Only you do this to me
So let's take two and turn us into three

'Cause I can't grow tired of your love
'Cause I can't grow tired of your love

Tell me baby
What I can do
To take the love you give 
And give it back to you
Break it down, let me know
Point your finger and baby, I will go

'Cause I can't grow tired of your love
'Cause I can't grow tired of your love
'Cause I can't grow tired of your love

We're leaving lonely to the fools

Dave Barnes,"I said don't you ever leave me lonely baby
You didn't know what to say
Now you got me worried 'bout the future baby
Doubt I see upon your face

Sometimes, yeah we move just like a freight train
And sometimes we don't even move
Somehow we're stuck here in this circle
Where you wait on me
I wait on you

Well love ain't got to be something complicated
It can be as easy as it seems
So tell me if we're hot or cold baby
Just save me from the in-between

Monday, we're smiling and we're laughing
Tuesday, won't return my calls
Wednesday, I'm tearin' up your pictures baby
Thursday night we're havin' a ball 

Love ain't got to be something complicated
It can be as easy as it seems
So tell me if we're hot or cold baby
Just save me from the in-between

Give me proof we're going forward
And you know I won't ignore it 
I just need to know what's goin on.
If you like this indecision
Well I hate to cause division, but I'm gone

Dave Barnes,"She drives down on Sunset
With the windows down 
Just so she can let it in
She knows he's far-gone now
But there still are pieces
Pieces there still left of him

He uses love like a bullet from a gun
She's careful like a surgeon
Everywhere he goes they all know to run
But she can't help but love him
Love him

There is a picture sitting by her bed
Her reflection in his face
She has been meaning, meaning to move it
But it's always been his place

He uses love like a bullet from a gun
She's careful like a surgeon
Everywhere he goes they all know to run
But she can't help but love him
Love him

City of angels, everyone is sleeping
4 am and she's awake
She is moving, moving that picture
Someone will fill that space

Someone will fill that space",The L.A. Song
Dave Barnes,"There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you,
There's nothing you could not find, in any other man. 
There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you, 
But I love you as hard as I can. 

There's no good reason for the way you love me, 
But you're my walking dream come true. 
There's no good reason for the way you love me,
But I thank God that you do.

I don't know the perfect conversation,
I don't know the way to turn a head,
I don't know the perfect way to prove my love,
But I know I'll love you till I'm dead.

There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you,
It's as simple as the stars in the sky, and the blue in the sea.
There's nothing fancy bout the way I love you,
But it sure is fancy how you love me.

But it sure is fancy how you love me.",Nothing Fancy
Dave Barnes,"On a night like this
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you

In this dark so dense
We talk so soft
The way young lovers do

The days last sight
Turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves
I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the Judas kiss

On a night like this
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you",On a Night Like This
Dave Barnes,"Mama's alone where the sirens call
They're filling up her mind like they fill the hall
Mama can't fight what she don't know
Baby looks fine while the cancer grows

Talking about the prayers of the saints
They can do what most men can't
God bends his ears just to hear what they say
Talking about the way they move 
Makes them do the things that they do
Somewhere a saint is praying for you

Papa's alone while the sun sets red
Papa stands fine, baby lays in bed
Papa blames this on what he don't know
Baby looks fine while the cancer grows

Talking bout the prayers of the saints
They can do what most men can't

There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night
Than wasted here with you
The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to win
Stay here by my side we'll watch 
The struggles start again

I need you now and forever
So stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept from me like a secret
And I swore that I was trhough
Until you, until you

The city settled down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration for
Every breath you breathe
Now this all makes sense
You ask company
I left all I knew with the better part of me 

I need you now and forever
So stay right here with me
Don't ever leave

There's songs reserved for angels
Would you sing me one, a stranger
Just to prove your love

And You know they tell me
You've given poor men kingdoms
Handed guilty freedom
Taken on their stains
Your love will never change
Your love will never change

They tell me
You dwell with good and evil
In alleys and cathedrals
Shadows and a light

And You know they tell me
You hold the world together
Not from guilt but pleasure
You somehow know my name

Dave Barnes,"Jethro plays the trumpet
In Mount Zion Gospel Band
Playing that thing for 15 years, just as hard as he can

Now keep on playing that thing Jethro
Fills my heart with joy

If you don't play that trumpet
Lord, who's gonna make all that noise

Bubba plays the tuba every Sunday at the church
Play that thing for so long babe 
Sometimes her lips they hurt

Now keep playing that thing Bubba
Fills my heart with joy

If you don't play that tuba
Lord, who's gonna make all that noise

Raymond is the drummer, sloppy as can be
Mama plays the organ like the 7th symphony
Papa plays the guitar, sometimes play the bass
And you can tell he's happy from the smile upon his face

Then there's little Liza who plays the tambourine
Sometimes play a smile
But mostly plays it mean

Keep playing that thing Liza
Fills my heart with joy

If you don't play that tambourine
Lord, whose gonna make all that noise

If you don't play that trumpet

Dave Barnes,"Baby, something is happening here
Though it's not perfectly clear, I think I like it
Baby, my heart and my brain can't agree
On the status between you and me
And where we're standing

And I can't tell you what it is but
It's the best thing that I've found
The butterflies in my stomach
And my feet off the ground
So for now I'm just saying, let's just call this love
Let's just call this love

Maybe, I'm over reacting a bit
Blame it on August and quit
And start all over
Maybe you might just feel the same way
Practicing both of our names 
Just to giggle

And I can't tell you what it is
But it's the best thing that I've found
The butterflies in my stomach
And my feet off the ground
So for now I'm saying, this just might be call this love
Let's just call this love

To continue in excess now suddenly feels oh so strange.
Prayers and money should not be confused,
But I pray that both still are used.

All of the stars are gone
Your purse is on the table; the TV's on

The day that I first saw you, you changed my mind
See, I was moving forward; I thought I was fine
There was a hole here in my heart that only love could see
I love you, Annie
It's so hard to see
What life without you would be like for me
Would the sky be as blue and the grass as green?
What would I be without you?

And I pray that when my life is done that they remember me

And branches in the yard
Don?t lose heart

Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me

This is not an accusation
The fault is probably mine
By now I thought we?d be familiar
Some things only come with time
Don?t lose heart

Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me

Hold onto me and I?ll hold onto you
Hold onto me holding onto you

Someday we?re gonna find it
Someday we?re gonna see
Someday we?re gonna find you and me
Someday it?s gonna be like breathing
I know it?s gonna be
Someday we?re gonna find you and me

It would come to this
What began with such a promise
Would end with such a twist

I lean into the whisper
But I don't hear a thing

It's a tear in the dark
All alone in the car
In pieces, in pieces
It's the sound of mistake
As I lie here awake
Sleepless, sleepless

This is the sound that made
When a heart breaks

Everybody's laughing
Maybe that's just me
Does something unrequited
Mean it will never be

This is the sound that made
When a heart breaks

Please don't leave me here

Life, for now, I've come to fear
You've dropped me off and left me here
With nothing here to find my way
But the lights you take as you pull away

Far ahead the brush is moving
There's others here and good is proving
Nothing's wrong, it's in my mind
Nothing's wrong and I'll be find

Dave Barnes,"Why is it, we have to run to understand
And why is it that every time we grow close
We fall down, and why is it I break my
Rules to let you in. Why is it?
I act the fool, let you in, you in
Now my spinning head is slowly slowing down
At least my lonely bed is in my favorite town
Sometimes at night feel heartbroken
Sometimes just don't know what to say
Sometimes I make mistakes and I hurt you
But we're only human and we're all built
That way
Now my spinning head is slowly slowing down
At least my lonely bed is in my favorite town

Don't expect too much
You've nothing to prove
It's a hard old station
Hold onto the truth
Words together send them to you
Explain how I feel
Explain what I think",Home
Dave Barnes,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents

I just want you for my own

All I want for Christmas
Is you

I won't even wish for snow

I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight

So brightly everywhere

Won't you please bring my baby to me

Nothing is wrong but conversations go long
I only want a minute with you
Let's rendezvous and sneak a kiss the time is right
No one will know
Meet me at the mistletoe
It will be while before the party ends
Another couple just walked in

The night's been great but I can hardly wait
Until it's only us again
The mistletoe is looking so good tonight
Let's rendezvous and sneak a kiss the time is right
No one will know

I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm goes through
And I need you

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

There's more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true

I just watched her leave

Dave Bartholomew,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know

Please say you love me too

So squeeze me but please don't tease me

Dave Brubeck,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint

I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you

Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

It's not hard to conceive

I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Dave Brubeck,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

",In a Little Spanish Town
Dave Brubeck,"The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see, 
For the moon refused to shine. 
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree, 
For love they did pine, 
Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness 
So she said, ""I guess I'll go."" 
Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, 
Told the moon his little tale of woe: 

""oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon, 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me and my gal!"" 

I can't see why a boy should sigh, 
When by his side is the girl he loves so true, 
All he has to say is: 
""Won't you be my bride, 
For I love you, 
Why should I be telling you this secret, 
When I know that you can guess?,"" 
Harvest moon will smile, 
Shine on all the while, 
If the little girl should answer ""yes."" 

""Oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon - for me and my gal !""",Shine on Harvest Moon
Dave Brubeck,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Dave Brubeck,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You

Dave Brubeck,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things

Raised up by merchants and drugstore liars.

Some lay him down in a junkyard bay.
Some will chase us and some will call us,

Scatter by bones on the wild green tide.

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

I sense a love that lasts for always.

But it can never really harm you,

That's deep inside you.
Soon the time will come for us to say
Goodbye,
But all the visions of our friendship will
Remain.
And every time I see a child look to the sky,
I will remember you.
We shared a love oh so true.

Yes I do,
There is no doubt.

So strange.
I close my eyes and feel the universe within

Just creeping out on me.
Your dizzy head, and smoky eyes,
You'll find some others bed to sleep.
So don't look back, it is too late,
No story to be told.
This creepin' mess you left for me,
Promising that you'd be home.

Saying your promise to be home.

As I'm sifting through these photographs of you
Life will never be the same
All these memories keep calling me to you
And it seems so long ago
And in my heart I'll always know
That I'll miss you most of all
When I see Flowers in the Rain
Wish I could do something about it
Life can be cruel, no doubt about it
In life's many mysteries
It just wasn't meant to be, oh no

Dave Davies,"Mum would shout and scream when dad would come home drunk
When she asked him where he'd been, he'd say ""Up the Clissold Arms""
Chatting up some huzzy, but he didn't mean no harm
Sunday morning drives, just to get away
Ramsgate or Southend, it would always be a laugh

Walking by the sea, full of dreams, eating ice cream

Fortis Green, memories of days when I was young
It can only be a memory. A time that now has gone
There's Uncle Frank tellin' stories from the war
Frightening all the kids, yet we'd heard it all before
While the bombs were droppin' round, there were parties underground
Aunt Lil's at the gin, while Mum's singing songs
From the 40's when variety, Max Miller was going strong
All the characters are gone, oh, what a blooming shame
I wish that it could be like it was in the old days
Sat on Auntie's knee, toasting bread in the fire-place
Fortis Green, memories of days when I was young
It can only be a memory. A time that now has gone
Memories of Fortis Green, when I was just a lad
Collecting bottle tops, threepenny bits. Fishing with my Dad
Sister's in the doorway, snogging with her bloke
Scared to put the cat out 'case I put him off his stroke
But she wouldn't be denied, I got a shilling as a bribe
I used to do my courting on an old kitchen chair
The girls were all so sporting, but I only really cared for my little Katie-Sue
There was nothing she wouldn't do
Sunday after tea we would listen to the wireless
Hancock's half-hour, Luxembourg. We'd sit for hours
Fortis Green, memories of days when I was young
It can only be a memory. A time that now has gone

Well it missed him by a whisker 
And the gunman could not be found 

They found a bullet in the chapel nearby
It was embedded in the altar stone
The statue Virgin upon the altar
Started bleeding on a Sunday 
And so the faithful- They came in thousands 
From as far as the Phillipines 
To pray for healing from the Virgin 
And to kiss that bullet clean
Word got around about the Virgin
There were pilgrims- There were tourists
Souvenirs and postcards 
Plastic virgins and bullet roseries

And many cripples started walking 
And the mute began to speak 
And the skeptics kept on talking

A bloodied rifle among the pieces
Found the sniper above the altar
Dead and tangled in the attic

As they rifled through his jacket
A bloodied wallet identified him
And his surname was Emmanuel
His given name was Jesus

So they buried him in the Chapel
With the rifle by his side
And they bought another statue Virgin
With the proceeds from the healing

Now she stands upon the altar
Spring water runs from the bullet hole
Now the Chapel is a shrine
They use the water to make wine

Dave Dobbyn,"Evening love
How's your day?
I'm bringing you the weather from the satellite jigsaw
Today was fine

Tears at times
A weak ridge from pressure from the hinter to the
Heartland
Who knows what it'll be

A briny breeze
Collars on the upturn, a nod towards the winter
And Monday
Is a Monday

Tuesday's a thunder day with a wind that chills you to
The bone
Wednesday
Don't mention Wednesday

Not a good one at all!
Otherwise fine
Otherwise it's dandy
Otherwise fine

Otherwise it's over the top
You got really rotten weather it's so hard
I know
Tell me where a weatherman should start

When he's miles from his sunshine
Promise you the warmest winter fire
When outside its freezing cold
Promise you the bluest summer sky

It'll shine just for you
And it'll be the outlook for Thursday
You're guess is good as mine
We'll be together

Yeah, together by design
Sunshine

Otherwise fine
Otherwise it's dandy
Otherwise fine
Otherwise it's over the top

Dave Dobbyn,"Tonight I am feeling for you
Under the state of a strange land
You have sacrificed much to be here
There but for grace as I offer my hand
Welcome home, I bid you welcome, I bid you welcome
Welcome home from the bottom of my heart
Out here on the edge
The empire is fading by the day
And the world is so weary in war
Maybe we'll find that new way

So welcome home, see I made a space for you now
Welcome home from the bottom of our heart
Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts
Keep it coming now keep it coming now
You'll find most of us here with our hearts wide open
Keep it coming now keep on coming now 
Keep it coming now keep on coming now

There's a woman with her hands trembling
And she sings with a mountain's memory 

There's a cloud the full length of these isles
Just playing chase with the sun
And it's black and it's white and it's wild
All the colours are one

So welcome home, I bid you welcome, I bid you welcome
Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts
Welcome home, see I made a space for you now
Welcome home from the bottom of our hearts
From the bottom of our hearts",Welcome Home
Dave Douglas,"[Verse 1:]
Once he seen you get so comfortable
Never wantin to commit fo sho
Always lying bout the girl next door
That's how all these things began
You let you guard down and he does you in
All you secrets he's been holdin that in
To throw back at you when it benefits him
So he can go and play with all his chickens

[Chorus:]
Tell me where the lyin and the front begun
Why you playin wit me 'cause it ain't fun
How can it be two if I'm your only one
That's how crazy this game is
Workin so hard to complete ourselves
Never thinkin that our love was on the shelf
Livin our life like there was no one else
That's how crazy this game is

[Verse 2:]
Who you messin with 'cause all the games you play
Oh you didn't know my name was Mary J
All the chicks you hear that heard they all look slave
Tryin ta gas me sayin things have changed
Now your like the furthest thing from my brain
Never thought I had to say it to you this way
All these years I been with you boy I feel so played
Now I need to go jump in my blazer

Dave Douglas,"Penélope,
con su bolso de piel marrón
why sus zapatos de tacón,
why su vestido de domingo.

Penélope,
se sienta en un banco en el andén
why espera que llegue el primer tren
meneando el abanico.

Dicen en el pueblo que un caminante paró
su reloj  una tarde de primavera.

Adiós, amor mío, no me llores, volveré
antes que  de los sauces caigan las hojas...

Piensa en mí, volveré por ti...
Pobre infeliz,
se paró tu reloj infantil
una tarde plomiza de abril,
cuando se fue tu amante.

Se marchitó
en tu huerto hasta la última flor,
no hay un sauce en la calle mayor
para Penélope.

Penélope,
tristes a fuerza de esperar,
sus ojos parecen brillar
si un tren silba a lo lejos.

Penélope,
uno tras otro los ve pasar,
mira sus caras, les oye hablar,
para ella son muñecos.

Dicen en el pueblo que el caminante volvió,
la encontró en su banco de pino verde.
La llamó: ""Penélope, mi amante fiel, mi paz,
deja ya de tejer sueños en tu mente...
Mírame, soy tu amor, regresé...""

Le sonrió
con los ojos llenitos de ayer,
no era así su cara ni su piel:
""Tú no eres quien yo espero...""

con su bolso de piel marrón
why sus zapatitos de tacón

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless

Dave Dudley,"Thank you Lord for all the miles without an accident
But I wanna ask one more favor before my life is spent
Please Lord this once before I turn to dust
Let me run the wheels plumb up a Greyhound bus
You know I have been running these highways in this old rig for a long long time
And I have been humiliated by them dang buses till it's a crime
Well even when I'm empty gettin' all that she's gotten high
They're blowin' their horns and flash them lights on just fly on by
But you know if I had me a rig I'd do about a hundred under the great big load
Well I'd wind her up tight and I'd blow me one of them grey dogs plumb off the road
So Lord before my last run to the foot of them mighty golden stairs
I hope there'll be an answer to this poor old trucker's prayer

Dave Dudley,"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised

It makes no difference now who was right who was wrong
Too late to go back now I've been away too long
I keep looking back over my shoulder

Hoping someday I'll see you smile and looking back at me
I walk along now on this road of regret
And the miles between us they had let me forget
I keep looking back over my shoulder

And I guess if I let you you'd hurt me all over again
And I can't help but wonder what was I thinking of
To think that your kind of woman could understand my kind of love
I made you my life while you made me into your fool
Yes I found that too late that your love meant heartache
Your kind of woman never could be true
But someday you'll know what a hurt when your heart breaks in two
And when your world falls to the pieces then you'll know what you put me through
And I hope I'm around when you'll learn what I'm speaking of

Oh mama, tell them what we're fighting for

Tell them that we're fighting for the old red, white and blue
Did they forget Pearl Harbor and Korea too
Another flag must never fly above our nation's door
Oh mama, tell them what we're fighting for

From Maine to California, there are many noble men
Who know the price of war and pray, we'd never fight again
But the world must learn, that we will fight, we will protect our shore

They might have to cut me outta this seat

And my back it's beginnin' to hurt
If I don't get to wheelin' to a stop pretty soon
I'll be takin' buttons off of my shirt

I got lost in the arms of a baby of mine
It was three in the morning, she was all alone
But don't you mention that to the boss
As far as he's concerned, I made a little wrong turn
And from there on out I guess, I got lost

I could stop and sleep but my freight won't keep
I got a deadline for makin' a call
I couldn't stay in bed, I got an oversize head
And my hat's about a size too small

I got my jacker break off and my windshield smeared
I'm headin' south drivin' into the wind

Make it on long night on the little white lines
I gotta go on a hummin' in my ears

If the flux don't get me with that radar bit
I'll be steady creepin' up on the block

I'll wheel it right into town

Dave Dudley,"(Well as long as there's a truck I won't forget Korea and Operation X)
I won't forget the year of '54 I drove a truck in that Korean war
Haulin' G-I's to the front and back in a truck they called Duce and a half
The orders called it Operation X we had to move in just an hour or less

First echelon and maintenance that was all and there were twenty men I had to haul
That south Korean sky was smoky black I was third in convoy from the back
But twenty minutes out they hit the nail it was mortar they were sendin' in the mail
We'll scatter out and find a hole they said cause Operation X is catchin' lead
I wheeled into a side road to the left drivin' to an almost certain death

I heard the steady creepin' of the shells the burnin' powder sent a deadly smell
And it happened as I pulled into a stop they hit us and I blacked out from the shock
Somehow I got back to the States alive and now I got another rig to drive

For when we reach the top of old Mount Eagle you can see this ol' binder roll
But it's a mighty rough road around Chattanooga there's kerbs on a four mile grade
It was on that grade that Joe lost his average

He was goin' down that road makin' ninety miles an hour
When the brakes on that old binder screamed
They were found in the wreck at the bottom of that mountain

Saying take a look at my gal's photograph
Then they gathered round him just to look upon her face that's smiling face
And he said I love my Filipino baby

Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene
Till I'll return to you fare Thee well Lily Marlene

Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet.

And Mom, we will carry them through.
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you.

And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name

And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight

Dave Dudley,"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup over hills and the meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun and we grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep he was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and he pulled me out
Now the years rolled along and at last he grew old his eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at him and said well I can do no more for him Jim
With a hand that was tremblin' I picked up my gun
And I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
But I just couldn't do it oh I wanted to run and I wished they would shoot me instead
Well I went to his side and I sat on the ground and he laid his head on my knee
I stroke the best pal that a man ever had then I cried so I scaresly could see
Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go and no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know old Shep has a wonderful home

Dave Dudley,"The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes

They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess
We must've drunk a case of beer

I guess I oughta go and watch them
Put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' 'bout the fire
And hell, well I get spooked

So I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass

Well, here they come and who's that ridin'
In that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome, I do believe that
That's the sharpest thing I've seen

That must belong to his rich uncle
Someone said he owned a great big farm
When they get parked, I'll mosey down
And look it over that won't do no harm

Well, that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know some women do look good in black

I think that when you's in the war

Dave Dudley,"One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at red light when these two men come and got me
And said that I was speedin' through their town

They said, ""Tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go""
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there over night so I'd just call my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

They motioned me inside the cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cell mate said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

We had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Next morning they'd just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I get my release
Later on we got more hot bologna eggs and gravy
By now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewing on the straw
He said, ""Where is this guy who thinks that this is Indianapolis
I'd like to talk to him about the law""

Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be a gettin' on my way
That part about me being who I was did not impress him
He said, ""The judge will be here any day""

The jailer had his wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to looking so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

Next morning that old judge took every nickel that I had
He said, ""Son, let this teach you not to race""

In thirty minutes I was out of state",Week in a Country Jail

Well ol' truck this is our farewell to the road
I guess we're both out of style
I could sell ye but I don't need the money

That doctor says I gotta get off the road
He tells me my eyes are sick
And they won't let you run when you get too old

Sometimes when I had me no help
I think I slept right behind that wheel

I'm gonna miss Ralph and Mike and Bill
And all them boys

We got the apple pie and coffee hungriest on the way
We pulled into a little truck stop just outside of town
Pretty soon the waitress came around
She said my name is Betty and I'd know you anywhere
I'd like to have a minute of your time if you don't care
Would you sing a song about me and the waitresses you've met
About the broken promises we get

All I wanna do is lay the blame where it belongs listen Betty I'm singing your song

I've seen some that were laughin' and I've seen some that were cryin'
I've left some that were happy and I've left some that were blue

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

I heard that old jukebox a playin'
Song about a truck drivin' man

That waitress done brought me my coffee
I thanked her and I called her back again
I said, ""You know that song, it sure did fit me
I'm just a truck drivin' man""

So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man

I climbed up aboard my old semi
Then like a flash, I was gone
Got old them big wheels a rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And drop another quarter in the jukebox
Play a song about a truck drivin' man

I said, pour me another cup of coffee

Dave Dudley,"I was out on the leave at the time just duckin' the fog nosin' around like a hungry dog
In that crazy place called Washington DC
I saw a crowd of people on the White House lawn all carrying signes about VietNam
So I went over to see what was goin' on
It was a strange looking bunch but then I never could understand some people
Oh a fellow came to me with a list in his hand he said we're gatherin' names to send
The telegram of sympathy then he handed me a pen
I said I reckon this is goin' to kids and wives
My friends over there who're givin' their lives
He said ah ah buddy this is goin' to Ho-Chi-Min
I said Ho-Chi who he said Ho-Chi-Min people's leader North VietNam
Oh I wasn't really sure I was hearin' him right
I though I'd better move before I got in a fight
Cause my ears were hurtin' and my ball started hit my lick
Then I thought of another telegram that I've just read
Tellin' my buddy's wife that her husband was dead
It wasn't too long till I was feelin' downright sick
Another held the sign that said we won't fight
I thought to myself boy ain't that right
To leave a lot of our soldiers die instead
I said it's a shame that every man who ever died up there that far off land
Was dyin' for that you wouldn't have to wake up dead
Course he looked at me like I was kinda crazy just another warmonger
Oh I left that place and I went downtown and hit first bar that I'd found
To cool myself off and pacify my brain
You see I was on orders to VietNam little old place just north to Saigon
Had about an hour to catch myself a plane
So all I mean to say is I don't like dyin' either but man I ain't gonna crawl",Viet Nam Blues

They stayed up all night, but they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy, she's a-walkin' down the aisle
And she catches my eye and she gives me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old-fashioned, but we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today, she never could have then.

Well I can see her now in the tight blue jeans
Pumpin' all the money in the record machine
Spinnin' like a top, you shoulda seen her go
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll [Repeat: x4]

Now her proud daddy only wanna give his little girl the best
And so he put down a grand on a cozy little lover's nest
You could've called the reception an unqualified success
At a flash hotel for a hundred and fifty guests

Take a look at the bridegroom smilin' pleased as pie
Shakin' hands all around with a glassy look in his eye
He got a real good job and his shirt and tie is nice
But I remember a time when she would never even look him twice

But I can see her now drinkin' with the boys
Breakin' their hearts like they were toys
She used to do the pony, she used to do the stroll
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll [Repeat: x4]

Well I can see her now with her headphones on
Jumpin' up and down to her favorite song
I still remember when she used to wanna make a lot of noise
Hoppin' and boppin' with the street corner boys
She used to love to party, she used to love to go
I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll [Repeat: x4]

Try as I might, I can't forget her smile
In passing conversation, what did I hear her say?
Where did she come from? Who is that woman anyway?

What can I do to change her mind?
Maybe she thinks that I'm just not her kind
I think she wants me but she's trying to play hard to get
When she treats me this way, I wish we'd never met

Dave Edmunds,"I was just 16 years old,
And Maggie's hair was black as coal.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Now, her eyes were bright as the stars up above.

Every word Maggie spoke was love.
And I felt this heart of mine go slipping away.
Falling in love again,
Falling in love again.

We don't care if we don't ever do
Fall back out again!
Time went on and my love it got stronger.
Me and Maggie couldn't wait any longer.

We had to go to town right away to see the Ju Ju Man.
I said, ""Please please tell me, Mr. Ju Ju Man,
Read the cards that you've got in your hand.
I've got to make a plan for me and my Maggie love.""

Falling in love again,

We don't care if we don't ever do

Maggie's Pa, now, I know he'd like to chain me,
Cause he don't understand a word of what I said.
I said, ""Please, Mr. Ju Ju Man,

Will I be holding Maggie's hand
When the robin sings again in the Spring, next June?""

On across Caroline.

We stopped at Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, 
We never was a minute late.
And we was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, 
Rollin' outa Georgia state.

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, 
Half way 'cross Alabam, 
When that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham.

So right away I bought me a through train ticket, 
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer outa Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans.

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town.
Well there are people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down.

Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit, 
Put luggage in my hands, 
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land.

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State; 
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate.

Swing low chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone; 
Cut your engines, an cool your wings, 
And let me make it to the telephone.

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Dave Evans,"I remember the day that Clayton Delaney died
They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his old guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray

I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin' up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be the good Lord likes a little picking too
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

It's a one horse town
It's a one horse way of life that I've been leading
It's a one horse town
No one in this town can give me what I'm needing

One one-chair barber shop
One local train that doesn't stop
One two-lane road, one motorcycle cop

This one horse town
Really brings me down
Still I hang around and chew the fat
With Ralph and Nat
The same old group
Those two-bit grinds
With their one-track minds
They'll wake up one day and find
I fin'lly flew the coop
I can't settle down
In this crummy one horse town


There's a roadside stand
You can go in back and feed the one-arm bandit
There's a one-man band
He can play your fav'rite song if you can stand it

Just give me one good year
I guarantee I'll disappear
I'll make my way to anywhere but here

With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,

Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.
Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.
Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed

Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay

Asleep on the hay

Cast out our sin and enter in

But a lion still rules the Barranca 
And a man there is always alone 

I played in a card game at Jolon 
I played with an outlaw named Juan 
And after I'd taken his money 
I staked all against his daughter Dawn 

I picked up the ace ... I had won her 
My heart it was down at my feet 
Jumped up to my throat in a hurry 
Like a young summer's day she was sweet. 

He opened the door to the kitchen 
And he called the girl out with a curse 
Saying ""Take her, Goddamn her, you've won her 
She's yours now for better or worse"" 

Her arms had to tighten around me 
As we rode down the hills to the south 
Not a word did I hear from her that day 
Nor a kiss from her pretty young mouth 

But that was a gay happy winter 
We carved on a cradle of pine 
By the fire in that neat little cabin 
And I sang with that gay wife of mine. 

That night I got hurt in a landslide 
Crushed hip and twice broken bone 
She saddled her pony like lightning 
And rode off for the doctor in Cholon 

The lion screamed in the Barranca 
Buck, he bolted and he fell on his side 
My young wife lay dead in the moonlight 
My heart died that night with my bride

Dave Hahn,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”",Cat's in the Cradle
Dave Hahn,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky mountain high (Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky mountain high

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high

It's Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky mountain high

Dave Hancock,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm in the 500, sitting on twenties
Pumping Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. getting money
I'm Hollywood swinging
It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singing
No Diggity, if it ain't def it ain't shit
I'm like kerosene I keep the place lit
Yo will fix the beat up
No beef read put the heat up
Yo Dave you the man now speak up

Friday, 5 o'clock time to close shop
Bounce through the hood, she was moving on the block
Cause my peeps already blowing up the box
With the 411 on the party hot spot
Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress
Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed
Gonna be a whole lot of woo-haa!
Know how we do on and on
Till the early morn
Always want to kick it not now I got move on
Beats pumping gotta get my groove on
Everybody's on the floor getting down
Players on the wild trying to spread the mack around
Red alert cause the bar's on fire
Serving drinks faster than you can blink an eye
Ain't gotta worry bout working next day
The weekend's here and it's time to play

Shorties rolling deep looking right
Reminding me of the f I just swung her last night
Oh my god shining, talking on the phone
Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone
Gotta put my thing down
Lock down the next round knock down for the next round
There's a run for the full-court press
Up and down bringing on the opposition stress
But it's all love this is how we do
Til the next Saturday keep it all true
Next stop speed down to the mall
Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball
Same time different place

To my favorite girl

God knows I do

Why, why
What's wrong with your shady ass 
Your waking me up early in the mornin' still yawning 
Don't you know a nigga half sleep 
So why the hell you keep on paging me 
I told you once before 
I'm goin' say it once again don't you call no mo' 
My girl is lying next to me 
Do you think this is a game 
Why you testing me 
You keep on stressing me 
 
Can't keep calling me 
All night long just constantly 
Interrupting can't you see 
I'm with my favorite girl 
What's that shit you on 
Talkin' 'bout my baby's Mom 
She's here laying in my arms 
She is my favorite girl 

I saw you around my way 
Riding by my crib just the other day 
The order of protection was restraining me 
I couldn't take the chance of someone naming me 
You tryna' frame me 
Leave me alone 
Callin' me and hanging up cause wifey is home 
How did you get my number in the first place 
Cause it ain't even listed under my name 

You call me 
And your telling me 
That you wantin' me 
And you needin' me 
Cause you lonely 
And you can't see 
How I could be with another 
B I T C H
And that she could never be my wifey 
Why can't you see it wasn't meant for you to be with me

Your crazy girl to think that I would ever leave my baby 
My lady 
The only one

Girl I know I've done you wrong before
Jeopardized our love
With thoughts of you walking out the door
Realized it's too late-what I've done to us
And if I can't have you now I can't go on
I can't imagine living on what used to be
Knowing that I just lost baby the best part of me
If I had half a chance to do it all again
I'll never ever break up a happy home between friends-ooooh my

Chorus
My feelings have taken over
What do I do now
I don't know
Girl I know that I've hurt you
But what can I say now
Please don't go

Verse 2
These cold lonely nights that I'm left here without you
I promise baby what's wrong I'll make it right for you
They'll be no mre lies no more games
This hurting feelings driving me insane
Cause I can't live my life
Baby I'm lost without you (without you)

Chorus

Girl the way you make me feel
When you say to me
You can't go on
I never wanted to hurt you
Just wanted to fulfill every one of your needs
Your my everything
I took you for granted and you took your love away
But I need you right here with me

We've been living in here, two years
You've been wearing this ring, one year
Times good, times bad
You said I'm down for whatever
Say down for whatever, say
Telling me that you've changed your mind
Said that I ain't been giving you time
Hustlin' morning till night, all the time
I know what you're feeling but you can't say

[Chorus:]
You can't say
That I'm not there
You can't say
That I don't care
You can't tell me I don't love
More than, more than anything

[Chorus:]

Now you're running the streets, all night
Where you been and you say, you're mama's house
I find it hard to believe
When you say whatever
And then you say get over it
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder
But it ain't working for me and I wonder
Why you treat me so bad, so bad?
When I've been in the beginning and there in the end

[Chorus:] (2x) 

More than the money I got
More than the cars I drive
More than this ice you see, you see
Are you down for whatever?
I'm still down for whatever, say
More than this house I live
Everything I got I'll give
Let me lay it on the line
Girl hear me out, out, out, out

I want to tell you how you make me feel 
Listen 

Let me tell you about few things that turns me on 
Just the little bitty things that make this love so strong 
Like how you push your hair back from over your face 
Bit your lip when you want me to come and taste 

[Chorus]
Make that face that you do when we're loving 
Make that sound that you make when we're hugging 
You know what I mean 
Baby do those things that you only do for me 
Close your eyes like you do when you kiss me 
Send that face that you send when you miss me 
You know what I mean 
Baby do those things that you only do for me 

Subtle way that you nudge me in the middle of the night 
It's just way of letting me know that the time is right 
You give me singles that nobody else can understand 
How you trimble at the slightest little touch of my hand 

You know when I want it,you put nothing extra on it 
It's just the simple things that you 
You know how I like it and I ain't afraid to try it 
As long as I am trying with you 
Cause only you can understand 
Just how to treat your man 
That's the reason that I made you my wife 
You always keep it real 
You know just how I feel 
See you made a difference in my life 

[Chorus]

Can I get a witness in here? 
Somebody knows what I'm talking about 
Only heaven knows

Shake off the haters and let it all slide

Won't rest until I say what's on my mind
Sick and tired of Hollywood game

I bet your Hollywood won't be the same
Cause some niggaz that we owe 'bout to get paid back

When the good fellas come through my nigga

Payback coming soon my nigga
The big payback coming to a hater near you

Promote me like you promised you would
Stop laying off right in the middle of my prime
Telling me you did everything that you could
Well I'm gonna do everything to make you hard to find
You really to small to deal with this drama
Like to short for you to really see
It's hard to be more when your new in my town
Had to sell it to much in love his story

Payback coming soon my nigga
The big payback coming to a hater near you

Guess who's back and breathing again
With a new budget and a dream on my side
When short folks left me for dead in the streets
Good fellas patched me up and kept me alive
Don't look now but up in the sky

Dave Hollister,"Ha ha I know y'all can feel me on this one
'Cause I'm talking 'bout the ghetto
Well, well, well, well, wel, oh yeah
Feel me, come go with me

I was about 13 as I recall
Just a young whippersnapper playin' ball
Tryin' to hang out with the homies after dark
We use to slap box until the street lights come on
And I can hear my mama yelling that it was time to come home
But being young you know how hard it be was
I can clearly remember all the other kids laughing at me
Because I use to wear those hand me downs
But if only they can see me now
And every now and then I reminisce about it
Well baby that's life as well you know
When you come straight from the ghetto

Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
Lookin' back as a kid again, hangin' in the hood again
Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
'Cause these are our sweet ghetto memories

We ate ghetto food, we wore ghetto clothes
Ended up being ghetto stars, driving our ghetto loads
With a diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' in the scene with a gansta lean ooh
Now I can clearly remember when it was cool
To do the Hammer dance
And everybody wore those pants
But back then I just couldn't afford it
And every now and then I reminisce about it
But its all good in the hood you know
Especially when your from the ghetto

Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
Lookin' back as a kid again, hangin' in the hood again
Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
'Cause these are our sweet ghetto memories

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talking 'bout the ghetto, talking 'bout the ghetto
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talking 'bout the ghetto, talking 'bout the ghetto

Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
Lookin' back as a kid again, hangin' in the hood again
Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that
Give me some of that good ol' ghetto
'Cause these are our sweet ghetto memories

{Ha ha, yeah this song goes out to all my homies
Who are locked up and all my homies who are passed away
Rest in peace
Ha yeah, yeah from the Goodfellas Family
To you and yours, so ghetto}

Hey yo, good ol' ghetto

Hey yo, hey yo, give me some of that

Dave Hollister,"Sometimes you would wonder if someone else was on my mind
I couldn't just tell you, how could I tell you? So I lied
Tryin' to save somethin' I wasn't being true to so blind
I know that you know but how did you know?

I lied even when I knew you knew the truth
I lied, didn't know what you would do so
I lied, to your face I lied
I lied even when I saw the pictures on the bed
I lied, you knew my every move and things I said
But I lied, to your face I lied

Late nights, I would come in well after three
And hadn't got caught one time
You better not trip on me 'cause I might leave you
And walk away in spite of all the things I put you through
I'm a fool, I know that you know but how did you know?

I lied even when I knew you knew the truth
I lied, didn't know what you would do so
I lied, to your face I lied
I lied even when I saw the pictures on the bed
I lied, you knew my every move and things I said
But I lied, to your face I lied

Noon day, the mailman had a special delivery for you
You opened it and screamed, ""Oh"", 'cause you saw me
Checkin' out of the Meridian with some floozie
I know that you know but how did you know?

I lied even when I knew you knew the truth
I lied, didn't know what you would do so
I lied, to your face I lied
I lied even when I saw the pictures on the bed
I lied, you knew my every move and things I said
But I lied, to your face I lied

I know the truth may let you down but it's better
Than findin' out from someone else
I know the pain is still the same but I should've
Been a man instead of foolin' myself

I lied even when I knew you knew the truth
I lied, didn't know what you would do so
I lied, to your face I lied
I lied, even when I saw the pictures on the bed

Dave Hollister,"Babygirl what's your name? 'Cause I like
No I don't have a girl I'm so trife
She's probably at the crib being a good wife
Without a clue that I'm coming to you tonight
She told me if I ever sneak she'd know
But she doesn't even know where I go
So like a fool to please my ego
I knocked her down like Ray Jones body blow

She'd laid it on me vicious no what I mean
Then granted me three wishes, now see
I don't want my girl to know where we be and
I don't want you to rock with nobody but me and
For my last wish I wanna know what the red
Light blinking is behind those blinds
She taped the whole thing and sent it to my girl
I'm Karma, vengeance is mine

K A are M A
Everything about her comes back around
K A are M A
Everything you do will find you somehow
K A are M A
On the card she left me was her name
K A are M A
Could be settling your score today

Two weeks later I met this guy drinkin'
He looked down so I asked what he was thinkin'
He told me about this girl he met one weekend
He had a wife but she was so worth the sneakin'
He took her shoppin' even took her on a cruise
He had a alibi in Vegas which was cool
By the time he got home it was to late
Wife and kids was gone and on the floor there was a tape

She'd laid it on me vicious no what I mean
Then granted me three wishes, lets see
I don't want my girl to know where we be and
I don't want you to rock with nobody but me and
For my last wish I want to know what the red
Light blinking is behind those blinds
She taped the whole thing and sent it to his wife
I'm Karma, vengeance is mine

K A are M A
Everything about her comes back around
K A are M A
Everything you do will find you somehow
K A are M A
On the card she left me was her name
K A are M A
Could be settling your score today

Know that Karma's looking for you, yea yea oh
You can't run, you can't hide
There's no use putting up a fight

Put out an A P be for this black girl
She's Chinese, no she's white, what in the world
Be on the look out 'cause she can change faces
And by the sound of things even change races
Please beware 'cause trouble make you weak
She's probably getting another victim as we speak
So check your record if you done any wrong
You'll soon be relating to this song

K A are M A
Everything about her comes back around
K A are M A
Everything you do will find you somehow
K A are M A
On the card she left me was her name
K A are M A
Could be settling your score today

Gotta take my time to sing my song

Seem like a couple weeks

Since I felt your body next to mine
If I said I could wait another day I should be lying, yeah
Said I almost forgot
Just how good it can get
So bring your body here
So I can make you sweat
What I'm gonna do to you
I guarantee you won't regret
I promise and put it on everything
You'll love every bit of it, oh

You gonna get pleased tonight
When I lay you down, and put it down
Sexin' you all night long, till the early morn
You gonna get pleased tonight
Girl your body's weak from the touch of me
Laying next to you till you go to sleep

Can you meet 'bout nine o'clock
With a trench coat and sexy pumps
Have a drink or two to loosen up
And focus on what's ahead of us
Candlelight, some massage
Some foreplay just to start
Bodies intent must release
Sexual healin' is what I need
Wanna taste your lips
Grab your hips, make you feel my grip
Some ole freaky shit
Take you to ecstasy
If you know just what I mean
Come on over here your body's callin' me baby
Turn your cell phone off and your pager too
There'd be no interruptions once I'm into you

And I still ain't got it all down
Never claimed to be the one

Truth is it's getting real hard
And there's somethings I don't understand
It ain't easy to live in this way
Believe me, I''ll try

What's wrong, with loving on the weekend
Or missing church 'cause I wanted to sleep in
And if I drink once a week, gotta sneak
Is that the way it is or is it just me?

God help me, I just wanna understand
God help me, I don't wanna be wrong again
God help me, 'cause everyday I'm struggling
But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

I'm the last one to point my finger
'Cause having done my share of err
But I'm getting tired of always being on trial
Yeah

I'm the topic of the he say, she say
When I don't wanna I gotta love my neighbor anyway
Am I wrong if I don't always wear a smile

What's wrong, with loving on the weekend
Or missing church, if a brother want to sleep in
And if I drink once a week, gotta sneak
Is that the way it is or is it just me?

But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

But the way they talking to me got me wondering what a
What's right from wrong, are you here the stress in the song
Well, it's enough for a brother to quit keeping on

I hear the preacher say, don't but my body say, do it
'Cause nobody will know about the gender juice fluid
Yeah, baby girl with the girls trying to get me to pursue it
But to keep it way real God knows everything you're doing

He knows I'm trying, I'm fight
Trying to follow the writing
All the preaching the, teaching
And the what the elders are speaking

I know you feel like sometimes
He ain't preaching
'Cause you party Saturdays
And then you Sunday go to meet Him

God help me, I just wanna understand
God help me, I don't wanna be wrong again

But if You help me I know I'll make it through another day for You

Like my Father cared for the weak
I really heard many stories
But check this one out

Every time I turn around, you're always complaining 'bout
How things ain't going right for you
When you working everyday and your bills are getting paid
So what's up with the attitude?

Need to make up your mind and you pray for overtime
You said you wanna have a piece
Of the good life that you get, for hardworking lots of sweat
Being just abundantly, can't you see

No one's ever gonna
Love you like He do, oh and
No one's ever gonna
Do these things for you

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
Dave Koz,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Dave Koz,"Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart in mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I feel so unsure
As you take my hand and lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbye

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
But there's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

[Chorus]

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay",Careless Whisper

I've been passing time watching trains go by,

Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face?

So many dreams to wake

Tells the moon to wait and the sun to linger
Twists the world 'round her summer finger
Lets you see the wonder of her arm?

And if you've learned your lesson well
There's little more for her to tell
One last caress, it's time to dress for fall

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?

Dave Lindenbaum,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world 
Will keep on turning

Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times",Good Time
Dave Lippman,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a voice in the wilderness
Sometimes I feel like I'm a voice full of cliches
Sometimes I feel like I don't know if I'm coming or going

And I'm right
Sometimes I know which way the wind is blowin
And I can duck
Why am I so lucky and why is it all bad luck",Thank You
Dave Loggins,"Please come to Boston for the Springtime
I'm stayin' here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a café where I hope to be workin' soon

She said ""No, would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy now won't cha settle down?""
""Boston ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
""I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night till they come back around
Please come to Denver
She said ""No, boy, would you come home to me?""

And she said, ""Hey ramblin' boy why don't cha settle down?""
""Denver ain't your kinda town""
""There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me""
""'Cause I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee""

Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill
Please come to LA

Dave MacKay,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory

Dave Madden,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

If I had to take the choice between the deaf man and the blind
I know just where my feet should go and that's enough for me
I turned around and knocked them down and walked across the sea

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt
But luckily for me they had to stop and then reload
And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come I'll take your soul
Wait until I come and I will steal you
Wait until I come and I will go

Darlin' dreamin in the night
Shadows on the windows
Lead oh and everyone go
Well leave me on the night
I will give you lightning
I will not relinquish light

Oh little dreamer eyes open and raving here

Wait until I come and see you little girl
When we come I'll leave with you too
When we come I'll let you come low

Hey we'll leave it all behind
Oh and then the nightmares
I'll fill them in good time
Oh they will seat your mind
When the light hits
And you maybe'll ask me

Why do you run around here
Why do you come inside of me
Why does it rip me out in dream
Why then why then watch this little fuck

Going away

Why this lonely
Why this lonely
Why this lonely love

Why this lonely
Why this lonely

Dave Matthews,"Satellite in my eyes
Like a diamond in the sky
How I wonder.
Satellite strung from the moon
And the world your balloon
Peeping tom for the mother station 

[Chorus]
Winter's cold spring erases
And the calm away by the storm is chasing
Everything good needs replacing
Look up, look down all around, hey satellite 

Satellite, headlines read
Someone's secrets you've seen
Eyes and ears have been
Satellite dish in my yard
Tell me more, tell me more
Who's the king of your satellite castle? 

[Chorus]

Rest high above the clouds no restrictions
Television we bounce 'round the world
And while I spend these hours
Five senses reeling,
I laugh about the weatherman's satellite eyes.

Dave Matthews,"So here we are tonight
You and me together
The storm outside, the fire is bright
And in your eyes I see
What's on my mind
You've got me wild
Turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping
Up heavy inside here
And know you feel the same way
I do now
Now let's make this an evening
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight
Stay here with me, love, tonight
Just for an evening
When we make
Our passion pictures
You and me twist up
Secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
But tonight let's be lovers,
We kiss and sweat
We'll turn this better thing
To the best
Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss
Tangled tongues and lips,
See me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Girl just tonight

Float away here with me
An evening just wait and see
But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends
Wait and see me,
Tonight let's do this thing
All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours
On our way here
Tomorrow go back to being friends

Go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Tonight let's go all the way then
Love I'll see you,
Just for this evening
Let's strip down, trip out at this
One evening starts with a kiss
Run away

And tomorrow
back to being friends

Just for tonight, one night, love you
And tomorrow say goodbye",Say Goodbye

All my worries of all those things that I dreamed and dreamed and dreamed
All I leave is, I have to say
It's nothing more than my point of view

It's hard and cold tonight
You're warming by a fire
Oh, sweet juice

Oh, the morning and the rain

Hey, love
What was the greatest thing you
Moments in the cold rain
Here to say there's nothing great that you wouldn't do

Fly, Raven
Won't you guide me?
Oh, what's the reason?
Won't you guide me?
Wait, now, what is the Raven?
Won't you come to me?

Is no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you, love
The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep us safe from the pain

But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted game we play

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
And hope to keep us safe from the pain

Will I hold you again?
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like a devil
In a church in the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between
Where you're smiling high
Is where you'll find me if I get tickled
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splash in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
'Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Love is all we need here

Just the other day
It was so hot outside
You could fry an egg
Remember you were talking
I watched as sweat ran down your face
Reached up and caught it at your chin
Licked my fingertip
Wasting time
Let the hours roll by
Doing nothing for the fun
Little taste of the good life
Whether right or wrong
Makes us want to stay, stay, stay
For awhile
Later on the sun began to fade
Then the clouds rolled over our heads
And it began to rain
Oh we were dancing mouths open
Splashing tongue taste
For a moment this good time would never end

Just wasting time
I was kissing you
You were kissing me love
From good day into a moonlight
Now a night so fine

All we can do is dream that the wind will blow us across the water

Baby, it's alright 
Stop your crying, now 

There was a weakling man
Who dreamed he was strong as a hurricane
A ship in a bottle set sail
He took a deep breath and blew across the world
He watched everything crumble
Woke up a weakling again

Some might tell you there's no hope in hand
Just because they feel hopeless

Was I a fool, was I a fool to think
That you would take me home
As if I was yours
Was I a fool to think at all?

I dance a thousand steps for you

Watching

We walk by them and hear voices yeah
No one ever stops to talk of things we'd rather do
They never did

What if God shuffled by
One day we might say
We're angry not afraid
Like breathing just to breathe
That we might find some reason

But there's much to go round
That's what's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They're only there until you're dead
Dream

Lying on the roof
Counting
The stars that fill the sky
Wondering why
Someone out there really isn't looking back down on me
You never know

So much space to believe
Only when you're small
A moment follows the cause
There's no one but you see
Hey there the moon is chasing me

And I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They're only there until you're dead
Dream
Oh oh oh la la la

One day fill your brain
With no cares in the world
The mellow tune come to play
She's all mine just for a day

And there's no time to waste
In the play of this game
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They're only there until you're dead

unforgivable down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light
Like a flash
You think you can you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem

Is it your dream
Dream

Spilling on being
And he fell on them
And every day should be a good day to die

Oh oh fall down
It won't be so long now
I do love I'll hand love
I find it hard to explain
How I got here
I think I can I think I can

I would dig a hole all the way to China
Unless of course I was there
Then I'd dig my way home
If by digging, I could steal
The wind from the sails of the greedy men who ruled the world

Still you my best friend
And after a good good drunk
You and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
Where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl

Well I was feeling like a creep
As I watched you asleep
Face down in the grass
In the park in the middle of a hot afternoon
Your top was untied
And I thought 'how nice it'll be the fall of your sweat down your spine'

You're my best friend
Or after a good good drunk
You and me
Wake up and make love after a deep sleep
Where I was dreaming
I was dreaming of a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl, dreamgirl

Caught by the wave my back to the ocean
It knocks me off my feet, just as I find my footing
Here you come again, dreamgirl, oh dreamgirl
That's all dreamgirl, but a dreamgirl, dreamgirl, oh wait dreamgirl

Do unto others as you'd have them do
Not an eye for an eye as the golden rule
Just leaves a room full of blind men

For fog in my eyes
I could not feel
For the fear in my life
From across the great divide
In the distance I saw a light

Walking to me with the maker

My body is bent and broken
By long and dangerous sleep
I can work the fields of Abraham
And turn my head away
I'm not a stranger

Have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there
With broken dreams
I have seen the flaming swords

There over east of eden

Burning in the eyes of the maker

And all the believers stand behind him and smile

Dave Matthews,"I'm driving through the desert I, met a man
Who told me of his crazy plan
He'd been walking there for 20 days
He was going to walk on

For 20 more
Said ""How about a drink or a bite to eat?""
He said ""No, my faith is all I need""
So then, save me
Save me mister walking man
If you can

You don't need to prove a thing to me
Just give me faith, make me believe
Come on, save me

Come on, save me

Stranger, if you please
Or am I too far gone
I see to get back home
To get back home

How about you take a ride with me
We could kill some time, shoot the breeze
He said ""every whispering wind and second counts""
Oh, maybe if you walk, but you should drive around

Save me
Save me
Mr walking man, if you can
Come on, save me

I don't need you to stall for some time, no
I don't need you to turn water into wine, no

I don't need you to, to fly
I'm just asking you to save me

You might try saving yourself
I'm gonna save me
You might try saving yourself

I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Put their slippers on

Dave McKenna,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Let me prove that it adores

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light

A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Dave Moore,"Well I used to go out people, every single night
Hangin' out in all the bars, 'til the morning light
Now that I am older, I have but one regret...
Half My Life I can't remember, the other half I can't forget

One day I got married and I tried to settle down
But the midnight hour rolled along and I'd head back into town
I couldn't get enough of what's-her-name...was it Claudette?
Half My Life I can't remember, the other half I can't forget

And the nights flew by, and I thought they'd never end
Now my mind is worried, now my shoes are thin
And the only friend I got left is my next cigarette
Half My Life I can't remember, the other half I can't forget

Instrumental verse

Ah let this be a lesson to those who still got time
Carve it on my tombstone, try to make it rhyme
When you lay me in the ground, write my epitaph

Half My Life I can't remember, the other half I can't forget

All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me)

And when youÂ´re out in the cold, 
No one beside you, and no one to hold, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Dave Mullen,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

Oh, thinking about all our younger years.
There was only you and me,
We were young and wild and free.
Now nothing can take you away from me.
We've been down that road before,
But that's over now.
You keep me coming back for more

Baby you're all that I want.
When you're lying here in my arms,
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven.
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven.
(We're in heaven)

Now, nothing could change what you mean to me. (Ooh)
There's a lot that I could say,
But just hold me now.
Cause our love will light the way

Baby you're all that I want.
When you're lying here in my arms,
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven.
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven.
(We're in heaven)

Now our dreams are coming true,
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you
(We're in heaven.)

Love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven!
Ohh, ohh, ohh.
Ohh, ohh, ohhh

Dave Pearce,"Deep in the bosom of the gentle night
Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black
This insomniac, take an original tack
Keep the beast in my nature
Under ceaseless attack
I gets no sleep
I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep

Twenty eight dollars in a fake silk purse and a leather skirt to wear
Shane came from Dublin town from the old world so green
Counterfeit ticket in to JFK in the land of his dreams

Even tough they only met that day they were lovers by dark
Laid out on the morning skies he puts a ring on her hand
He said listen babe we gotta take what's ours do it or die

It's all emotion when you take control,
I can feel wild horses running in my soul.
Oh my love, all I see
The stars, the sun, the energy,
If this going to kill us then let it go,

Up high above a desert sky where the space shuttles scream,
Sixteen men from a dying earth take their last dream.

Stay together

To say goodbye

To hold on to 
What we've got 
Must be a reason 
To hold on to

To set 
Things right

Is there 
Something on 
Your mind 
Tell me what you 
Hide inside 
Tell me the truth

Know, will

Will you go

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be

Dave Pell,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí",Frenesi

I didn't wanna do it 
I didn't wanna do it 
You made me want you 
And all the time you knew it 
I guess you always knew it 

You made me happy sometimes 
You made me glad

You made me feel so bad 

You made me cry for

I want some love that's true

Dave Pell,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a fine word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger 
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri
't was goodbye on the Isle of Capri",Isle of Capri
