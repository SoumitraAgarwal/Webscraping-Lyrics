Keren Ann,"She'll take you back,
Don't make believe
You wanna think it through.
I've loved before,
I love again,
I know that yours was true!

Wake up slowly, there are blue skies
Cutting white lines in black matter!
I see them shining through your drunken eyes,
Carving silver is strange weather.

I'll meet a man,
We'll make a home
And travel to the deep
Of further lines,
While hidden dreams
The broken hearted keeps.

Wake up slowly, there are blue skies
Cutting white lines in black matter!
I see them shining through your drunken eyes,
Carving silver is strange weather.

She'll take you back,
Don't make believe
You wanna think it through!
I've loved before,
I'll love again,
I know that yours was true!

Wake up slowly, there are blue skies
Cutting white lines in black matter!
I see them shining through your drunken eyes,
They only want me in strange weather!
In a small room, on a naked floor,
With the blinded heart of black matter
I could hear you through the front door
Carving silver is strange weather.",Strange Weather
Keren Ann,"I never seen you clear before
I never heard you cry
My blinded heart is washed ashore
My innocence gone dry
And I wish I had more patience
There are things I can't reverse
I don't know why you were so threatened by the entire universe

You were on fire
Tainted in this sun
You ran against the raging wind
Decadent and drunken with desire
Fooling the love of everyone
Your reverence in flames
Your eyes were golden and awake
You were on fire

And no one's ever saved you
You only saw him bleed
And his sorrow misbehaved you
To avenge and not to plead
But out here there is no other
Whose seen you broken down
Barren, blameless for your lover
Bold and fearless for the crowd

You were on fire
Tainted in this sun
You ran against the raging wind
Decadent and drunken with desire
Fooling the love of everyone
Your reverence in flames
Your eyes were golden and awake
You were on fire

You were on fire
Fooling the love of everyone
Your reverence in flames
Your eyes were golden and awake
You were on fire

I never seen you clear before
I never heard you cry
My blinded heart is washed ashore
My innocence gone dry
And I wish I had more patience
There are things I can't reverse
I don't know why you were so threatened by the entire universe",You Were on Fire
Keren Deberg,"Pack up all your things
And box up unspoken dreams
With nothing lost
And nothing gained
I’ll get back on my feet again

Leave the kitchen light on please
I won’t cry, won’t make a scene
Just do this quick, your needle stings

Wake me when you’re gone
Cause I don’t need to sleep tonight
I don’t even care

Will you miss my face?
And how long till I’m replaced
Your cryptic smile
Makes me aware
Oh, 
You were really never there

What a tragic waste of time
Don’t act if you really tried
Erase the blackboard in your mind

Oh,
And wake me when you’re gone
Cause I don’t need to sleep tonight
I don’t even care
Its not like you would recognize if I’m not even there
Oh,
Wake me when you’re gone

And all the things that we were supposed to be
And all the things that we will never, see
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
And wake me when you’re gone
'Cause I don’t need to sleep tonight
I don’t even care
Its not like you would recognize if I’m not even there
Oh, wake me when you’re gone
Oh, wake me when you’re gone
Oh, wake me when you’re gone",Gone
Keres Katia,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas
Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby","All I Want for Christmas ""Is You"""
Keres Katia,"So this is Christmas and what have you done,
Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,

'Cause see, some women just tolerate too damn much
Now I know we gotta choose our battles
But damn it, every woman gotta breaking point
And see the next time he's testin' your love
You put your finger in his face and you tell him

Keri Hilson,"Not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could

Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
OMG you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down, yeah",Knock You Down [Moto Blanco Club Remix]
Keri Hilson,"So long my lovesick youngsters
Goodbye my used to be friends
I remember each vacation
Each day we wasted
It felt so different then

So long my Casanova
Fair well to my long lost friends
I remember all the kisses
The hits and misses
I never knew a love like this

After all the boys that I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
After all the boys that I wished had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this feeling before
Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Oh yeah you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

So long my traveling soldiers
Reminisce about the boy cross town
Peace to the wide eyed genius
With Hollywood dreams
Said he never wanted to be tied down
So long my high school teacher
Damn I had a crush but I couldn't reach ya
Remember all the guys
They were never right
I'm so glad I found you this time

After all the boys that I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

After all the boys that I wished had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this feeling before

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

Oh when I didn't know
I did not know
Til you let me know
And I didn't see
I could ever be
This happy
And I never loved
In a way that I do today
Oh I'll never be the same
Since your loving came my way

Say you love me love me love me
You love me love me love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me loved me loved me
But yeah you love me love me love me
Ooh you love me love me love me

Keri Hilson,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Feels like I can breathe
You lift a burden off my chest

Traces of sadness
No more chain me to the ground

And funny poem
I accidentally
Overheard

It keeps
The little children playing
And bigger children
Spread the word

My memory is bad
So I always tend
To forget how it goes
But

Life is my creation
Is my best friend
Imagination
Is my defense
And I'll keep walking
When skies are grey
Whatever happens
Was meant that way

You're no better
Or no worse
Than the others
We are all the same

And life
Is just a moment
You might as well
Enjoy this day

It's time
To start believing
That everything
You want is on it's way
And

Life is my creation
Is my best friend

Is my defense
And I'll keep walking
When skies are grey
Whatever happens
Was meant that way

We'll be growing
Into knowing
While we're floating

Little creepy town in a little creepy world
Little creepy girl with her little creepy face
Saying funny things you have never heard

Do you know what it's all about
Are you brave enough to figure out
Know that you could set your world on fire
If you are strong enough to leave your doubts

Feel it, breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
And you'll be walking on air

She has a creepy little cat and a creepy little bat
Little rocking chair and an old blue hat
That little creepy girl, oh she loves to sing
She has a little gift, an amazing thing

With her funny little eyes of hazel
With her funny old blue hat
She will go and set the world on fire
No one ever thought she could do that

Feel it, breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try, go fly, so high
And you'll be walking on air

Feel this, unless you kill it
Go on, and you're forgiven
I knew that, I could feel that
I feel like, I am walking on air

Flitter up, and
Hover down, be
All around, be
All around

You know that I love you
Go on

Feel it, breathe it, believe it
And you'll be walking on air
I knew that and I could feel that
I feel like, I'm walking on air

But if you wear those golden earrings,

Hurrying into Spring

I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Give it all till there ain't no more

All I need will be found within Your presence

When I'm finally home
And I finally know
What it really means to praise His name

Nothing left for this wandering soul

Kerrie Roberts,"I wish I never really had to fall this far
Could have the wisdom of a broken heart
Without all the pain
And I wish I could find a way to just forget
All the yesterdays that I regret
That I don't want to face

But Lord, you saw these moments
Before I began to breathe
And You see how to use them
And where they're going to lead

And I will rest knowing You are holding me
I believe You will never say goodbye
I close my eyes
Unafraid of what I cannot see
'Cause I am always in Your sight

Sometimes, I never feel like I am good enough
I wonder if I'll ever measure up
But that's not the truth
And I'm through with my emotions always guiding me
They take me places I don't want to be
So far from You

And I've lived in fear of failing
But that's just my pride
And I know it's not about me
'Cause I've given You my life

And I will rest knowing You are holding me
I believe You will never say goodbye
I close my eyes
Unafraid of what I cannot see

Where could I go
What could I do
There's no place I know
Apart from You

And I will rest knowing You are holding me

Kerrie Roberts,"His eyes take in all the glory of worlds
His voice holds power
His ears hear the sound of the songs the angels sing to Him
Shout eternal praises

He left all of this just to give us a chance
To be closer to Him and to know what love is
Put His feet on the ground that He made with His hand
He lived just to die, but He lives again

No road was too lonely
No cost too great
No distance too far for the reach of His grace
All He left behind
All He sacrificed for every soul throughout all time
Nobody loves like Jesus loves
Like Jesus loves

We do our best to recount all His steps
To picture His face and learn what His word is
We fight against hell to live how He lived
The hope in our hearts is the life that He gives

No road was too lonely
No cost too great
No distance too far for the reach of His grace
All He left behind
All He sacrificed for every soul throughout all time
Nobody loves like Jesus loves

Come to Him all who are broken
Come to Him all who are searching

Cause nobody loves like Jesus loves
Like Jesus

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Kerry Politzer,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Kery James,"28 décembre 77, aux Abymes j'suis né
D'une famille plus proche d'être pauvre que d'être fortunée
Mes parents sont originaires d'Haïti
Terre indépendante que mon cœur a choisi pour pays
La plupart de mon enfance, je l'ai passé auprès de ma mère
Je peux pas ne pas mentionner qu'elle surmonta beaucoup de galères
Et elle continue à ramer, trimer, jusqu'à cette heure
Sur une main je peux compter le nombre de fois que je les vu en pleurs
On nous fit venir en France au prix de nombreux sacrifices
Pensant que la France était terre de réussite
Octobre 85, dans ce pays j'atterrissais
Le temps était gris et j'ignorais ce qui m'attendait
Souvent les parents ont pour leurs gosses de l'ambition
Ainsi ma sœur et moi on s'est retrouvé en pension
Loin... de ma mère, tu le sais, enfance amère
Loin d'ses enfants, pour une mère, vie amère
Éloignés d'elle, le temps qu'elle construise ses repères
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle nous récupère
Puis on a quitté la pension pour venir vivre à Orly
Et ce que j'ai vu ce jour-là, a sûrement changé ma vie
Dans un pavillon ma mère louait une seule pièce
Qu'un rideau séparait 30 mètres carré au plus
Dans ce truc-là on était 5, vivant dans la promiscuité
Ouvrir un frigidaire vide, me demande pas si je sais ce que c'est
Mais maman nous a jamais laissé crever de faim
Maman a toujours subvenu à nos besoins
Pour notre bonheur, elle a sacrifié le sien
Étonnant ce que l'on peut faire par amour pour des gosses
Avant je ne portais pas de Nike Air, mais plutôt des Jokers
Mon style vestimentaire, provoquait des sourires moqueurs
Ce qui développa en moi, très vite la rage de vaincre
La rage d'exister, l'envie de réussir
Influencé par les Orcas, Litle Jay et Manu Key
Avec Teddy et Harry, Idéal J on a formé
À l'age de 14 ans est sorti notre premier disque
Alors j'ai espéré pouvoir vivre de la musique
Mais mon rap était trop sincère, trop dur, trop franc
Conséquence succès d'estime, mais trop choquant pour leur France

Nos vies souvent se ressemblent
Le destins parfois nous séparent
Les erreurs ont des conséquences
Qui font s'envoler nos espoirs

Nos vies souvent se ressemblent
Le destins parfois nous séparent
Les erreurs ont des conséquences
Qui font s'envoler nos espoirs

Puis l'école contre la rue, peu a peu j'ai échangé
Sont arrivés les premiers joints
Du lycée, j'ai pris congé
J'étais de ces gosses qui auraient pu réussir
Mais légèrement trop féroce pour que le système puisse me contenir
Issu des blocs de béton, la rue m'attendait au tournant
Elle m'avait toujours guetté, mais jusque là je l'avais feintée
Et avant que je puisse me rendre compte, elle m'a emporté avec elle
Est venu l'époque que j'appelle entre rap et business
Entre rap et business, mes potes et moi, grosse équipe
Veux tu que je te raconte la suite ?
Skunk, popo et shit, transactions illicites
Sur le terrain on prend des risques
On prétend devenir millionnaires sans jamais rien donner au fisc
Sans même s'en rendre compte on s'enfonce dans la violence
Le plus souvent sous défonce, tout ce qui bouge on te le défonce
Une embrouille, on bouge à 10
À coté ça vend des disques, jusqu'à croire réellement que
Tu peux pas test Mafia d'Afrique
Les ennemis se multiplient, jusqu'à ce qu'on puisse plus les compter
Vu que la vie n'est pas un film
On sort enfourailler
On le sait et on sent, on le sait et on sent que ça part en boulette
Ça parle de se ranger mais qu'après avoir pris des pépètes
C'est ce que j'appelle la rue et ses illusions
Derrière lesquelles se cachent la mort ou la prison
La prison mes potes y rentrent, y sortent, reviennent
Et moi j'échappe à leur justice de justesse
C'est dans la rue, que j'ai appris à connaître L.A.S
Et su que derrière tout dur, se cache un peu de faiblesse
Aujourd'hui t'es avec un pote et vous vous charriez
Mais t'attend pas à ce que la mort t'envoie un courrier
L.A.S, nous a quitté subitement
Que Allah le préserve du châtiment
Dans ce bas-monde, les actes et pas de comptes
Mais dans l'au-delà les comptes et pas d'actes
Je me suis réellement senti en danger
J'ai su que je risquais de me noyer, si jamais je plongeais
Les vagues de la violence, tôt ou tard m'auraient submergé
Victime de mon insolence, de la rue je suis un naufragé
Et j'ai nagé, alourdi d'un fardeau de mes regrets chargé
Et même à ce jour ne croit pas que j'ai émergé
Je t'assure, je garde les traces de mon passé
Tu sais, ces choses qu'on ne pourra pas effacer
Puis j'ai appris l'Islam cette religion honorable
De transmission orale auprès de gens beaux et fiables
Elle ma rendu ma fierté, m'a montré ce qu'était un homme
Et comment affronter les démons qui nous talonnent
J'ai embrassé le chemin droit et délaissé les slaloms
Ceux qui m'ont éduqué je remercie, j'passe le Salam
À tout les musulmans de France, de l'occident à l'Orient
Ceux qui ce bas-monde voudrait quitter en souriant
Mais yeux se sont ouverts, mon cœur s'est épanoui
Me fut dévoilé, peu a peu tout ce qui m'a nuit
Jusqu'à ce que je devienne de ceux qui s'inclinent et se prosternent
Voudraient aimer pour leur frères ce qu'ils aiment pour eux-même
J'ai une vie et j'en connais le sens je ne pars plus dans tout les sens
Ne soit pas étonné si au rap conscient je donne naissance
A la précipitation, je préfère aujourd'hui la patience
Aux paroles inutiles, la sauvegarde du silence
A l'intolérance et au racisme l'indulgence
Et à l'ignorance j'aimerai rétorquer par la science
Ce bas-monde, terre de semence que plus tard tu récoltes
Le jour où l'âme te quitte, subitement qu'la mort t'emporte
Sois intelligent et sème-y ce qui t'es utile
Ceci est l'enseignement de l'Islam et il hisse l'âme
Loin de tout extrémisme, la voie de droiture
L'unique voie a suivre et si le système te sature
L'Islam ramène l'amour, rassemble les gens de tous les pays
De toutes les origines, toute les cultures, toutes les ethnies
Y'a pas que des riches et des pauvres, y a des gens mauvais ou biens
J'ai réappris à vivre, compris les causes de notre déclin
Et quand je regarde mon passé, j'ai failli y passer
Si je n'avais eu l'Islam peut être que je me serais fait repassé
Ou la moitié de ma vie en prison, j'aurais passé
Pour ceux qui y sont passés, ici, j'ai une pensée
Mais combien sont partis sans avoir eu le temps de se préparer ?
Chargés de pêchés et d'injustices à réparer
Avant que la mort, ne me vienne, faut que je répare les miennes
Si je veux récolter du bien, c'est du bien qu'il faut que je sème
Un jour je partirai, et serai enveloppé d'un linceul
Au mieux de mes vêtements dans un modeste cercueil
Et lorsque je serai mort, et que cette chanson tu te remémores
Sûrement quelques larmes viendront humecter ta mémoire
Maintenant tu sais d'où je viens, qui je suis et où je vais
Et pourquoi mes textes de sagesse sont imprégnés
D'une famille plus proche d’être pauvre que d’être fortunée
28 décembre 77, aux Abymes j'suis né
Et à une date que j'ignore un jour je partirai",28 Décembre 1977
Kery James,"J'observe ce qui se passe et me rends compte que tout va mal
J'vois qu'ils se bouffent pour l'argent
Car l'argent possède ce A d'avilissant
Pour tous les jeunes de tous les quartiers
Les pauvres, les riches!
Mec de rue et tu le sais

La rue a fait de moi Kery James le mélancolique
J'vais pas me plaindre, certains en sont devenus alcooliques
D'autres on finit dans le trafic de narcotiques
Inondent nos rues de toutes sortes de substances toxiques
Au départ très inquiétant étaient les pronostics
D'autant plus déconcertant sont les diagnostics
J'vois qu'ils s’entre-tuent de façon méthodique
Ca n'empêche pas de dormir un flic, ça j'suis catégorique
Les miens vivent une galère, faut que ça s'ébruite
De mômes, ils n'ont plus l'air, ils deviennent des brutes
L'usage de la violence devient automatique
Systématique devient l'usage de l'automatique
Quand leurs espoirs se tuent, leurs rêves se meurent
L'amour de l'argent les ronge, telle une tumeur
Certains ont pris pour religion le dollar
D'autres comme dans dans ces polars où la plupart finissent taulards
L'argent les rend le A de arrogant
Car l'argent possède ce A d'avilissant
Tous sont persuadés qu'ils ne pourraient vivre sans
Alors au risque de décéder ils portent la cagoule et les gants

Ils portent la cagoule et les gants même au risque de décéder
Qu'importe le prix à payer, ce qu'ils veulent c'est posséder
Ils sont obsédés, parfois même comme possédés
Et la plupart du temps ne s'en prennent qu'aux dépossédés
Ils disparaissent comme dans le triangle des Bermudes
Ils ne respectent plus rien, sous prétexte que la vie devient rude
Tous prétendent vouloir faire carrière dans l'illicite
Marché plus saturé que celui de l'industrie du disque
Il suffit que l'un d'entre eux sorte la tête de l'eau
Pour qu'ils s'empressent de le noyer au nom de la loi du ghetto
Puis à tord et à travers, ils crient, réclament l'unité
Alors que dans leurs cœurs a pris place l'animosité
Les gens de chez sont devenus pires que des hommes d'Etat
Franchement attends toi que j'fasse état de leur état
Le diable leur à fait croire que la fin justifie les moyens
Ils veulent pas de ton job, ils s'moquent de l'honnête citoyen
Ils sont déconnectés de la réalité
Beaucoup se font buter, pour eux ça devient une banalité
Les gens scrupuleux se font rares, en voie de disparition
Les crapuleux pullulent, eux certes en voie d'expansion

L'argent les rend arrogants, parfois même violents
Ils ont pour conviction qu'ils ne pourraient vivre sans
Les rend arrogants, parfois même violents
Ils ont pour conviction qu'ils ne pourraient vivre sans

Parti du bas, tu vises le sommet
Et pour cela l'interdit, tu le commets
Tu n'en a pas pour toi-même, tu veux du respect
La réputation des tiens, tu compromets
Tu prends le pactole et tu te casses, ça tu te le promet
Mais ça tu l'aurais déjà fait, si tu le pouvais
Et au placard le prix du crime, c'est toi qui le paie
A l'extérieur, avec ton fric, c'est ta tête qu'on se paie
Parfois tu jures que tu ne te rangeras jamais
Certains t'entendent, ne crains-tu pas qu'ils te butent?
Dans la rue ça ne joue plus et ça tu le sais
T'es loin d'être bon mais y'en a toujours un plus mauvais
C'est aux richesses que tu veux le A d'accéder
Quitte à laisser ta famille le A d'accablée
L'argent tu veux le A d'en avoir
T'es pas très loin de posséder le A d'avare
Alors t'attaques la main le A d'armée
T'es pas très loin du A d’assassiné
Combien quittent les bancs de l'école pour ceux de la cité?
Mais combien abritent leurs familles loin du quartier?
Leurs yeux brillent pour l'argent comme s'ils en étaient épris
Pour lui ils ne craignent pas de provoquer les peurs et les cris
Pourtant certains d'entre eux sont fils d'honnêtes gens
Le peu qu'ils ont, leurs parents l'ont acquis en travaillant
Ainsi j'dédis ceci à tous ceux qui se lèvent de bonne heure
En quête du bonheur mais malgré tout préservent leur honneur
Ils savent prendre sur eux-même et quelle que soit leur humeur
Travaillent pour survivre même si petit à petit ils y meurent
Ils luttent pour être honnêtes à la sueur de leur front
S'acquittent de leurs dettes pour pas qu'on leur fasse affront
C'est pas qu'ils ont baissé les bras, c'est plutôt la vie qu'ils affrontent
Gardent la tête haute pour pas que sur eux s'abattent la honte

J'dédie ce morceau à ceux qui bossent comme des hommes pour nourrir leur famille
En quête du bonheur mais malgré tout préservent leur honneur
Et j'dis qu'il vaut mieux peu gagner honnêtement que beaucoup mal acquis
La rue a fait de moi Kery James le réaliste

L'argent les rend arrogants, parfois même violents
Ils ont pour conviction qu'ils ne pourraient vivre sans
Les rend arrogants, parfois même violents
Ils ont pour conviction qu'ils ne pourraient vivre sans

Ah il choque grave
Le sujet? Il choque tout le monde
C'est à dire, ça choque quoi! C'est la vérité, non?
C'est voilà, c'est la vérité, une vérité quoi
L'argent ça rend fou les gens, non?
Surtout chez nous, c'est dangereux chez nous
L'argent, les gens ils pètent les plombs à cause de l'argent
Plus d'amis, plus rien

C'est devenu grave
Et puis, ici j'attire le A de ton attention
Remarque que dans le quartier, faut faire le A d'attention
Trop de gens en quête du A de l'ascension
Et ça qu'importe les moyens ça c'est le A de l'acharnement
Sois pas surpris quand sonne le A de l'ambulance
Criminelle A quoi? Criminelle ambiance
L'atmosphère quant à elle, s'est le A d'alourdie
Et la violence prend le A de l'altitude
Étrange est le A de leur attitude","Ce ""A"" d'Avilissant"
Kery James,"Issu des quartiers meurtriers, là où le meurtre y est trop fréquent
La vie de you-voi et ses conséquences
J'raconte les trips du ghetto, ses ambiances louches
Quand sonne le fusil à pompe, tout le monde se couche
Pas un voyou qui fasse long feu t'es prévenu
À peine tu viens d'ouvrir les yeux que t'es détenu
La mort ou la prison t'as que deux issues
L'histoire s'répète et tu crois être le plus vicieux
Tu veux grimper par n´importe quel procédé
T´es donc sujet à de judiciaires procédures
La rue te guette, mec, les flics aussi
T´as peut-être déjà vendu une barrette à un vil-ci
Entre les traîtres et les balances
Tu te balances comme sur un fil
Ta carrière peut prendre fin
Sur un coup de fil d´une balance
Un mec qu'est mal et passe à table
Ton numéro d´écrou remplace celui de ton portable
Là, tu connais l´envers du décor
La prison et son univers hardcore
Faut qu't'assumes, même si son atmosphère t'asphyxie
Le juge t´allume et fait ber-tom ton sursis
Affaibli malgré ton moral d´acier
Leurs barreaux, tu souhaiterais pouvoir les scier
Maintenant que la parole devient l'encre
Tu te rends compte qu'il y a peu de gens pour qui tu comptes
Peu de courriers et encore moins de mandats
Qu´est-ce que tu crois?
""Pour survivre t´es pas assisté""
Ta mère n´a que ses yeux pour pleurer
Le cœur serré tant que son fils est incarcéré
Ébranlée par cette douloureuse conviction
Qu´elle a échoué, manqué à ton éducation
Et dès que t´es sorti ça y est t´es reparti
""Puis t´es reparti dès qu´ t´ es sorti""
Les plus jeunes te prennent pour modèle
Ils comptent sur toi pour
Que tu leur fasses prendre de l´oseille
Ça t´arranges vu qu´ t´ as les flics sur les reins
Tu n´hésites pas
Les mômes tu les fous sur le terrain
Tu veux pour eux
C´que tu ne voudrais pas pour ton fils
Et ta morale ne l´emporte pas sur ton vice
Te remettre en question, pour toi pas question
Tu te fous du monde des flics et de leurs questions
Tu te méfies de tout même des sourires
Tu sais qu´en prison
Beaucoup voudraient te voir pourrir
D´autres te voir mourir après t´avoir fait courir
Pour parvenir à cela
Ils seraient même prêts à te nourrir
Là où les ennemis et les amis se confondent
Peux-tu dire qui sur ton sort viendra se morfondre
Les gens t´aiment tant que t´es rentable
T´es réputé mais peu fréquentable
T´étouffes car la vie que tu mènes t´étrangle
Tu deviens ""ouf"" tu connais la loi du boomerang
T´es dans l´attente de
Celui qui ne frappe pas mais entre
On dit que tu pèses
Pourtant tu vis la peur au ventre
Pas étonnant
Y a pas que les flics que t´as sur le dos
Peux-tu dénombrer le nombre de types
Qui voudraient ta peau?
T´as vu, tes ennemis t´es incapable
De les dissocier de tes amis
Car en fait t´as pas d´amis, juste des associés
T´es entouré de gens et rarement seul
Mais surprenant la façon dont tu te sens seul
Ton histoire est triste
Mais malheureusement t´es pas le seul
Ni le dernier, que l´argent va mener à son cercueil
Car dans ce milieu tu fais rapidement des jaloux
Des mecs qui te voient debout
Et souhaiteraient te mettre à genoux
Ainsi peu probable
Que tu puisses avoir une fin heureuse
Tu peux compter les jours
En attendant qu´une balle te creuse
Avoue que le quartier t´a eu
Et que comme à l´intérieur à l´extérieur
T'es comme détenu
T'es même pas certain
De pouvoir assurer une descendance
T´en peux plus, ""la nuit tu ne dors plus""
Tu penses aux potes que t´as perdu
T'aurais jamais cru
Que la vie de you-voi serait si re-du
C´est émouvant
Tu t´enlises dans des sables mouvants
Et tu ne fais que t´enfoncer à chaque mouvement
T´aimes une femme qui elle, aime le calme
Mais ne souhaite pas épouser tes histoires de shit et de came

Te voilà bloqué entre deux, t´es prévenu
Y a pas un voyou qui fasse long feu
Si t´as des gosses
Qu´est-ce que tu vas leur apprendre?
Comment se faire respecter
Et devenir le chef de bande?
Leur diras-tu que pour devenir millionnaire
Y a pas besoin de diplômes
Et que papa fut un gangster?
Combien de jeunes sur cette route a deux issues?
Ainsi vivent beaucoup de mecs d´où je suis issu
Combien d´entre eux n´atteindront pas la trentaine?
Au lieu d´un an ou deux
Écoperont d´une vingtaine d´années
Là où sont couronnés les condamnés
Faire marche arrière ils appellent ça déballonner

Je reviens de tellement loin qu'il se peut que j'en pleure
Je reviens de tellement loin, que je t'avoue parfois j'en pleure
Je croyais être prêt, mais les choses ont pris une telle ampleur
De quoi semer la terreur, dans le plus arrogant des cœurs

Pendant que j'étais plongé dans un nuage de fumée
J'ai beau pleurer toutes mes larmes, mais ils ne reviennent pas

Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Avant l'heure ce n'est pas l'heure
Et après l'heure ce n'est plus le moment
On naît, on vie, on meurt
Mais ce que l'on ignore c'est comment
Chaque respiration nous rapproche de notre échéance
La vie ce n'est pas un film qu'on se remet a la prochaine séance
Chaque jour, ce sont des pages de nos vies qui s'écrivent
Nos gestes et nos faits c'est ce qu'ils y inscrivent
J'pense au mal qu'on s'est fait, plus qu'au mal qu'on a fait
Mais le mal qu'on s'est fait, conséquence du mal qu'on a fait
Les regrets profitent aux vivants et pas aux morts
J'm'excuse auprès de ceux à qui j'aurais pu faire du tort
Car du jour de ta mort, sois certain qu'personne t'informe
Reconnaître ses torts, c'est ça être un bonhomme
Y'a tant de gens que j'aurais voulu embrasser
Mais les jours, les mois et les années sont passés
Malheureusement ces gens là ont trépassé
Me laissant que mes pleurs et mes regrets
Me voilà balafré à jamais, la blessure est interne
Et à tout moment elle saigne
Si c'était à refaire, assurément j'ferais autrement
Mais les choses sont telles qu'elles sont et ce ne sera jamais autrement
Et je garde les traces de mon passé
Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Je t'assure je garde les traces de mon passé
Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Je t'assure je garde les traces de mon passé
Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Je t'assure je garde les traces de mon passé
Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Je t'assure je garde les traces de mon passé
Ces choses qu'on ne pourra plus jamais effacer

Je t'assure je garde les traces de mon passé",Si C'était Á Refaire
Kery James,"Message d'amour même en temps de guerre
Alors que certains attisent les passions
Moi j'rappe pour les Noirs, les Arabes et les Blancs
Saches que je suis pas de ceux qu'effraient la différence
Ta couleur de peau pour moi ne fait aucune différence
Y a pas de couleur pour aimer, pas de couleur pour souffrir
Pas une couleur qui t'empêche de mourir
Pas une couleur pour s'aimer, pas une couleur pour sourire
Pas une couleur pour pleurer (tu le sais)
Dans nos différences nous sommes liés
Nos apparences ne sont pas toujours le reflet
De ce que contiennent nos cœurs et c'est ce qui importe
Y a pas de couleur pour que la mort t'emporte
Y a pas de couleur pour tricher, pas d'couleur pour tromper
Pas de couleur pour blesser ou tuer
Pas une couleur qui t'immunises contre la douleur
Pas une couleur qui te rendes supérieur (sache-le!)

Ma sœur y a pas d'couleur pour pleurer
Tu vois mon frere, y a pas d'couleur pour aimer
Pas d'couleur pour soufrir
Pas d'couleur pour sourire
Y a pas d'couleur pour pleurer

Y a pas de couleur pour être stupide, ignorant, raciste et borné
Pas une couleur attitrée à l'absurdité
Pas une couleur qui prouve ton intelligence
Pas une couleur qui témoigne de ta tolérance
Pas une couleur qui t'empêche de te sentir seul
Foudroyé, rescapé d'un amour manqué
Pas une couleur qui t'abrite de la pauvreté
Pas une couleur qui garantisse ton honnêteté
Pas une couleur qui te protège de l'erreur, frère
Pas une couleur qui te protège de la peur, sœur
Pas une couleur qui t'innocente de toute injustice
Aucune couleur ne garantit ta réussite
J'connais les méfaits du racisme et ce qu'ils provoquent
Quand l'exclusion devient rage, arrive le choc
Même en temps de guerre alors que la paix agonise
J'réanime l'amour dont l'absence m'épuise

Y'a pas d'couleur pour pleurer
Pas d'couleur pour aimer
Message d'amour même en temps de guerre
Y a pas d'couleur pour pleurer
J'dis qu'il n'y a pas d'couleur pour aimer

Kery James,"A notre époque, trop de gens s'entraident pour l'injustice
Ils croient s'aimer, se trahissent, puis se divisent
Nous on te parle d'amour véritable
Leila Rami, Diam's, Kery James et Disiz!

L’amitié se passe de paroles, quand tu la vis et que c’est un acquis
A qui veut l’entendre, tes amis c’est pas ton équipe
L’amitié naît sans raison et avance sans horizon
Mon ami, ce texte est en fait une oraison
Une amitié qui se finit en fait n’avait pas commencé
De vrais liens faits dans le bien, amènent à se réconcilier
Si le cœur y est, l’amitié envahit l’âme entière
C’est la matière première qui rend plus riche qu’un diamantaire
(L’unisson de la poitrine)
Et son absence c’est la sécheresse du cœur
Sereins et dignes, on avance sans avoir de rancœur
Lorsque l’on te fait ces cadeaux qui n’ont rien de somptueux
Mais comme venant d’un ami, c’est en ces sens qu’ils sont précieux
L’amitié ne se cherche pas afin de tuer le temps
Elle est meilleure, lorsqu'elle se réserve pour les heures vivantes
Elle est là, parce qu’elle est là non pour combler le vide
L’amitié, c’est l’amour véritable
Elle ne mange pas à la table de l’antipathie
L’amitié a pour cousine la sympathie
Quand elle s’absente, tout le monde en pâtit
Imagine ce monde si elle est totalement partie
Elle scelle les relations humaines et les rend fluides
L’amitié c’est Dieu Qui l’a créée, Amine
Elle sert à former une communauté
C’est l’amour véritable, c’est elle, c’est l’amitié

Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment
Et c’est pour cela certainement que beaucoup de gens saignent
L’amour véritable peu de gens l’sèment
Très peu d’gens l’savent car très peu d’gens l’enseignent

Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment
Et c’est pour cela certainement que beaucoup de gens saignent
L’amour véritable peu de gens l’sèment
Très peu d’gens l’savent car très peu d’gens l’enseignent

La vie c’est triste quand t’as personne pour partager
Depuis l’époque des cartables on s’est tous départagés
Ami, t’étais là quand j’allais ou quand j’allais pas
Puis tu m’as fait ça dans mon dos alors qu’il ne fallait pas
Mon cœur est grand, j’ai voulu abriter tout le monde
Puis j’ai appris que les soi-disant amis peuvent vous faire de l’ombre
Peu sont sincères, mais comme c’est ainsi
J’me suis fais un cercle d’amis, avec la paix pour insigne
Pas besoin que je te prouve quoi que ce soit
Si ça n’va pas tu peux m’trouver où que ce soit
J’suis là pour toi, tant qu’ça peut te faire du bien
Mais ne me demande pas d’te suivre vers un chemin qui m’éloignerait du mien
Tu connais ma vie, mes convictions et mes buts
Donc si t’es mon ami, sois correct depuis l’début
Je t’oublierai pas, toi qui m’a aidé sans cesse
Peu importe ce qu’ils disent, t’inquiètes nous on sait (laisse)
J’ai la vingtaine et les amis ça compte
Ni père ni frère ni sœur y’a qu’à mes amis qu’j’me raconte
L’amour véritable ne se résume pas qu’à ça
Mais j’ai dans l’cœur, mes potes d’école et du bac à sable
La vie c’est dur quand t’es seule et mal-aimée
Et l’amitié c’est une richesse qui à elle seule m’a aidé
Ce morceau est pour mes amis, sur qui je peux compter
Ceux-là même à qui j’ai confié des choses si dures à conter

Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment
Et c’est pour cela certainement que beaucoup de gens saignent
L’amour véritable peu de gens l’sèment
Très peu d’gens l’savent car très peu d’gens l’enseignent

Celui qui t’appelle au mal, c’n’est pas ton pote
Mais plutôt ton ennemi en quelque sorte
Unis pour des biens pas pour le bien
Ils croient s’aimer jusqu'à ce que l’argent les sépare
Quand t’aimes quelqu'un tu veux pas l’voir souffrir
Quand t’aimes quelqu'un est-ce que tu l’aides à se détruire?
(Pose-toi la question), pose toi la question!
Puis fais le tri dans tes fréquentations
Faut qu’tu choisisses tes amis parmi les meilleurs
Pas parmi ceux qui ne font qu'embellir tes erreurs
Car ceux qu’on aime d’un amour véritable
On les empêche d’accomplir c’qui est blâmable
Aimer, combien en saisissent le sens?
Parfois la trahison s’trouve dans le silence
Il s’peut que le silence tue, le sais-tu?
Le mal se propage parce que le bien s’est tût
Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment
Et c’est pour cela certainement que beaucoup de gens saignent
L’amour véritable peu de gens l’sèment
Très peu d’gens l’savent car très peu d’gens l’enseignent
L’unité, beaucoup s’en donnent l’illusion
Mais l’unité ne vient pas sur la corruption
La corruption souvent entraîne la trahison
La trahison rime elle avec division

Ce son transpire l'émotion
Et nos paroles sont sincères
Là d'où l'on vient, peu de gens s'aiment

Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment
Et c’est pour cela certainement que beaucoup de gens saignent
L’amour véritable peu de gens l’sèment
Très peu d’gens l’savent car très peu d’gens l’enseignent

Là d’où j’viens réellement peu de gens s’aiment

Kery James,"On naît, on vit, on meurt, mais ce que l’on ignore c’est comment 
La louange est au Seigneur, Celui Qui contraint par la mort 
Où que tu sois sur terre, dans les mers 
Elle vient à toi, ta vie n’est qu’éphémère 
Elle est celle qui brise les passions, te sépare de tes proches, 
Apporte la solitude et te sépare de tes biens 
Sache que lorsqu'elle vient en fait c’est toi qui pars 
Et avec elle y a pas moyen pour qu’elle repasse plus tard 
Elle est celle qu’on ne repousse pas, elle prouve notre faiblesse 
Elle touche les blancs, les noirs frappe même en pleine jeunesse 
Elle apporte la douleur lorsqu'elle emporte les nôtres 
Mais pousse à réfléchir et aide au repentir 
Elle ramène l’équité, rend beaucoup moins arrogant 
Par elle nous sommes unis, cela qu’importe nos opinions 
Qu’importe ton origine, ton rang social ou ta couleur, 
Ton nombre de diplômes elle passe te prendre à l’heure 
Les pleurs lui succèdent ainsi que les regrets 
Elle raye nos ambitions, elle balaye nos projets 
Si elle inquiète comme ces choses inconnues 
Elle est douloureuse, voilà ce que d’elle on a connu 

Elle met fin aux actes pour que viennent leurs conséquences 
Châtiment intense ou réjouissante récompense 
Tu peux tenter de l’oublier mais elle n’oublie personne 
Et la plupart du temps elle ne prévient personne 
Non, Elle ne prévient pas mon frère, elle surprend 
Elle ne demande pas ma sœur, elle prend 
Attachés à cette vie, beaucoup craignent de la rencontrer 
D'autres s’égarent et espèrent pouvoir la contrer 
Mais sache qu’elle est une porte que tous devons franchir 
Qui est venu ici-bas doit nécessairement partir 

Combien sont les gens plongés dans l’insouciance 
Ayant peu de crainte et beaucoup trop d’espérance 
Courant après une vie qui souvent leur tourne le dos 
Et quoiqu'ils obtiennent c’est autre chose qu’il leur faut 
La plupart des hommes sont ainsi, insatisfaits 
Très peu se contentent de ce qu’ils ont comme bienfaits 
Mais rappelle-toi mon frère, ma sœur 
Qu’il est un voyage que tous devons entamer 
Alors nos bagages il convient de préparer 
Avant qu’elle ne vienne de cette vie nous séparer 
Ce bas monde, un pont menant vers l’au-delà 
L’intelligent le traverse et ne s’y établit pas 
Rendons-nous des comptes avant la rétribution 
Ne soyons pas tel celui qui voyage sans provisions 
Car elle est proche, elle arrive, elle vient 
La vie est comme un instant, une lumière qu’elle éteint 
En fait elle c’est la mort, la mort, c’est elle 
Les gens sont comme endormis c’est lorsqu'ils meurent qu’ils se",Elle

J'vois en toi tout ce que j'aurais voulu être
Et croire en moi, les erreurs pour toi j'les ai faites
Tu s'ras toujours tenté de regarder vers le bas

L'enfant un bienfait qui nous est confié
Son cur un diamant qu'il reste à tailler
Un verre vide qui attend d'être rempli
Une source de bonheur malgré les soucis
Une vie qui change la nôtre
A laquelle on voudrait épargner nos fautes
Et si l'on craint pour lui le feu et le froid
Alors que dire du feu de l'au-delà
A notre époque beaucoup l'oublient et c'est le drame
Peu d'enfants reçoivent la nourriture de l'âme
Grandissent sans distinguer le bien du mal
En étant des proies faciles pour le chaytan

C'est pas parce que t'as nourri, habillé ton môme qu'tu t'en es bien occupé
Commence par le rééduquer, le diable t'a dupé
Tu dois leur inculquer "" Din "", les valeurs fondamentales "" Din ""
Avec ferveur, c'est ainsi qu'on fonde un mental
Un enfant c'est comme un appart, c'est toi qui le meuble
Il repose sur l'éducation tel un immeuble
Sur sa fondation, si ça commence de travers
Il finit courbé, comme la tour de Pise, embourbé
Dans les vestiges mon gars
En restant ignorant tu risques de le fourvoyer
Imprègne-toi d'la croyance pour protéger ton foyer
Croyez en Dieu, Craignez le feu
J't'avertis l'Haram est fertile
Société pervertie, rend orgueilleux, versatile

J'vois en toi tout ce que j'aurais voulu être
Et croire en moi, les erreurs pour toi j'les ai faites
Tu s'ras toujours tenté de regarder vers le bas

J'vois en toi tout ce que j'aurais voulu être
Et croire en moi, les erreurs pour toi j'les ai faites
Tu s'ras toujours tenté de regarder vers le bas

Entre ascendants et descendants, y'a contraste
Pourquoi ta fille n'est pas pudique, ton fils n'est pas chaste
Regarde c'qu'ils consomment, la télé les façonne
Cultive la légèreté d'la parole, la morale, laisse les
Qu'ils s'rebellent, le monde une poubelle, l'irrationnel
Entre parents et enfants attouchements sexuels
Moi j'dis, y'aurait pas autant d'débordements ou d'fléaux
Si toutes les créatures éprouvaient leurs égaux, délaissaient leurs idéaux
Au Créateur, interroge ta conscience
Juste l'existence reste inexpliquée par la science
Allah nous éprouve pour qu'on fasse nos preuves
L'éducation conditionne pour faire face aux épreuves

J'vois en toi tout ce que j'aurais voulu être
Et croire en moi, les erreurs pour toi j'les ai faites

Kery James,"C'est un message de paix avant que la spirale du temps nous élimine
C'est un message d'amour à toutes nos sœurs et nos frères musliminis
C'est un appel à la raison, la crainte et à la discipline
À l'heure ou l'homme détruit la terre et les gosses explosent sur des mines
J'dis que l'islam est la lumière qui t'extrait de l'obscurité
La vérité qui éclaire ton coeur de bonté et d'humanité
La voie de droiture change nos différences en facteur d'unité
Sérénité, sincérité, simplicité, humilité

Et qu'il nous agrée ici au Paradis pour l'éternité

Manbara passe un message positif
Pour tous les frères arabos? peace
Comme la colombe banche cette musique est porteuse d'espoir
Faut croire, ne pas laisser de chance au désespoir
Savoir d'où l'on vient, tisser des liens, resouder les miens

Faire que tous les ennemis marchent main dans la main
Même cause même combat de Paris à Istambul

Haïtien d'origine
Pourtant ces musulmans moyés
l'islam est la seule croyance que l'on ne peut pas monnayer
y'a aucun? forfait de vie, qui t'apporte force, courage, honnêteté à ton avis
Qu'à accepter tout ce monde, noirs, blancs?
en bons musulmans Haïti au Saint c'est pas un terrorisme mouillé
nous pas raciste mais justice nous aimer
en turque, en banbara, en woulof, arabe ou français
même en créole on ne va chanter que des thèmes rassemblés
pas ni noirs ni blancs y'a des gens mauvais ou bien
le meilleur d'entre nous après les prophètes sont des Saints",Ensemble
Kery James,"La force
Dans la grandeur de l'âme
Ce que nous apprend l'Islam

Dans nos quartiers règne l'illusion, qu'être un homme fort
C'est collectionner arrestations et bastons
Et c'est cette illusion qui les perds, les enfermes, les enterres
Ils confondent courage et folie, raison et lâcheté
Ils ne peuvent distinguer entre orgueil et honneur
Leur besoin devient cupidité
Ils courent après une vision déformée du bonheur
J'dis que mes frères ont faussés les valeurs
Alors sur eux s'abattent les malheurs
Le mal est devenu bien à leurs yeux
C'est le regard noir des cœurs aveuglés en banlieue
Mais j'dis que l'homme fort, est celui qui maîtrise ses passions
Indulgent, sincère, modeste et patient
Il pardonne car espère être pardonné
Maîtrise sa colère même s'il peut l'exercée
Et quand le faible se plaint, le fort se bat
Il ne cautionne pas l'injustice mais la combat
La pauvreté ne l'amène pas à la corruption
Il voit à travers les épreuves une bénédiction
Le fort a du cœur donc pleure, parfois, par inquiétude pour le faible
Lui fait face à la réalité, tandis que le faible fume pour anesthésier sa douleur
La femme forte sait dire non
On l'aime pour ce qu'elle est, et pas seulement pour ce qu'elle parait
Qu'elle soit sœur, ou mère, elle est force et la vertu l’éclaire

La force d'un homme, se compte aux larmes que verse son âme
Quand il se sait dans l'erreur
LA force d'un homme, n'est pas dans son Arme
Mais dans la grandeur de son cœur

Tu sais Kery, faut que nos frère atterrissent
La réalité, le plus lourd haltère
Et c'est pas en pompant qu'on d'viens costaud
Qu'ils s'guèrissent de ce mal de vivre
Qui fait que la haine livre au coeur de la chaleur de Moscou
Etre libre, c'est pas qu'avoir des chaînes brisées
Vois l'homme moderne, esclave des chaines télévisées
Plaquent, les principes que nos parents nous apprennent
Disent qu'être un homme c'est être riche
C'est ce qui freine les frères à Fresnes
Font croirent au monde qu'être fort, c'est avoir
C’est avoir un magnum comme Harry, une Ferrari comme Magnum
Ils nous marient, avec le vouloir faire, puis le pouvoir faire
Nous fait oublier le devoir faire, de Mars à Paris
C’est ce qui nous rend faible, de croire à leurs fables
Faire le contraire de ce que veulent nos cœurs, suivre leurs vibes
Être un mouton dans leur bouse
La force d’un homme ne se lit pas sur la virgule de leurs shoes
Mais sur les rides qui décrivent l’histoire de nos pères
Sur ces ampoules qui éclairent leurs doigts pour payer nos Roberts
Sur les cernes que l’inquiétude dessine sous les yeux de nos mères
Jusqu'à la mort, j’resterais fort, pour leur honneur, pour leur amour, fier
Pour tout ce qu’ils ont abandonné
Pour me donner la chance d’avoir une vie décente au lieu d’être cantonné
A une vie de chien, du whisky en guise de Friskies
Tout ça j’esquive, avant que mes narines fassent du Jet ski
Réalise, que Allah nous guide
Qu’on se rallie, tous sur le droit chemin
Que Allah nous guide, que la foi nous donne la force de couper les algues
Qui me tirent vers le fond, que Allah nous guide

La force d'un homme, se compte aux larmes que verse son âme
Quand il se sait dans l'erreur
LA force d'un homme, n'est pas dans son Arme
Mais dans la grandeur de son cœur

La force d'un homme, se compte aux larmes que verse son âme
Quand il se sait dans l'erreur
LA force d'un homme, n'est pas dans son Arme
Mais dans la grandeur de son cœur

Ne profite pas de ta force, ton poids sur les plus faibles que toi
C’est pas loyal, lèves-toi, tu lui fais mal, tu l’écrases
Tu feras fort si tu l’écrases quand le faible a raison
En vérité la raison du plus fort ne l’a jamais emporté
Ça craint d’être craint, la hagla ne paie pas c’est prouvé
C’est comme la balle dans la roulette russe, si tu la cherches tu vas la trouver
Tu vas crever comme un pneu, orgueilleux, borné, haineux
Fataliste au point de ne plus pouvoir dénouer tes propres nœuds
Beaucoup vivent pour le regard des autres, pour ce que pensent les autres
Personne pour rattraper l’autre
Puisqu'il faut toujours aller, plus loin que l’autre
La guerre continue, y’a plus de respect, plus de vertu
L’incompréhension se perpétue, on valorise ce qui nous tue
Le faible fournit des efforts et le fort n’a pas besoin de renforts
Souvent le fort aboie, le faible boit, croyant que ça le rend fort
Cet homme indifférent aux insultes j’honore
Consulté, on lui dit: ""C’est toi que j’insulte!""
Il répondit: ""c’est toi que j’ignore""
Encore plus fort, un aveugle qui se plaint pas de vivre dans le noir
Fort de porter aucune attache aux richesses, au pouvoir
Prends l’argent, le laisse pas te prendre, il va te surprendre
Crois-moi je me fous de l’or, ça vaut pas une hassanat après la mort
La jalousie, la médisance sont des faiblesses en soi
Y’a pas plus fort que la science, le silence pour pas dire n’importe quoi, l’abstinence
Fort d’aider celui qui a des lacunes
Faible l’égoïsme, la lâcheté, la rancune
Fort d’être souriant malgré les déboires
Fort de partager une miette accepter un verre de calcaire à boire
Fort mes rimes car elles contiennent la foi
Fort le Din, faible la Dounya
Forte l’expression du visage de ceux qui reviennent du pèlerinage
Fort de ramener l’argent halal à la raque-baba
Y’a pas plus fort que prier
Allahou‘Akbar

Kery James,"Ayant été profondément touché par cette vague de violence
aveugle qui a et continue de frapper l'humanité dans sa chair
et parce que les auteurs de ces actes les ont injustement
attribués à l'Islam, j'ai entrepris de réaliser un disque dans
lequel je voudrais mettre en lumière ce que l'Islam confie
comme enseignement de paix, de fraternité, de modestie
de patience face aux injustices, de générosité et autres qualités humaines
Les artistes, d'origines et de confessions diverses
conscients des nobles objectifs de ce disque se sont mobilisés bénévolement

En effet, une partie des bénéfices de cet album sera reversé
pour la construction d'un centre culturel en France ouvert
à tous dans lequel sera dispensé un enseignement religieux loin
de tout extrémisme et fidèle à l'esprit du disque
Ce centre, géré par l'association Savoir et Tolérance aura également pour
mission de proposer des cours d'alphabétisation, du soutient
scolaire et d'organiser des événements sportifs et culturels
Dans un souci d'ouverture, j'ai souhaité qu'une autres part des
bénéfices soit reversée à une association n'ayant aucun caractère confessionnel
l'association CVHG affilée à Handisport
J'ai l'espoir que grâce à ce disque reculera la peur de l'autre
qui a souvent pour origine la méconnaissance de
l'autres et dont la conséquence peut etre malheureusement la haine de l'autre
C'est pour cela que j'ai souhaité donner pour titre à cet album

Un 4 avril 77 à Oujda jsuis né
D'une famille plus proche d'être pauvre que d'être fortunée
Ma mère exerçait alors dans le domaine scolaire
Donnait aux enfants du quartier des cours d'arabe littéraire
C'est à deux mois seulement qu'elle prit conscience d'ma maladie
Une nuit en faisant bouger d'vant mes yeux la flamme d'une bougie
Le lendemain on partait pour la France par avion
Pensant qu'cette terre était pour moi un espoir de guérison
Malgré les efforts des médecins il n'y avait rien à faire
Une autre épreuve encore dont mes parents ont su se défaire
En m'inculquant l'Islam et l'histoire de nos pères
Ils m'ont aidé à m'en sortir par le biais du système scolaire
Ils m'ont appris qu'en Islam l'épreuve est un bienfait
Une maladie, la pauvreté nous purge de nos méfaits
J'ai affronté la vie, fait face à ses difficultés
Et ici l'oujdi prose pour tous les déshérités
Pour tous ceux éprouvés par des maladies graves
Pour ceux qui vivent dans la misère sachez tous qu'elle nous lave
Que Dieu expie nos fautes à chaque douleur subie
Et elles sont à nos yeux bien plus précieuses que tous vos rubis

Non, ne pleure pas, non ne souffre plus
Si tu es dans les tourments
Remercie quand même Allah, car il y a encore
Une grande foi parmi les croyants
Si tu patientes dans cette vie-là
Mon Seigneur n'oublie pas, sois tranquille
Weshdi

J'veux un enfant, donner naissance
Aimer sa mère avec abondance
Maintenant qu'des épreuves j'ai la connaissance
Mon cur l'accepte en toute innocence
Mauvais caractère j'en ai subi les conséquences
Maintenant j'me calme j'me relance et je n'crois plus aux coïncidences
J'fais preuve de patience, de persévérance et j'pense prudence
Il faut que la cour de l'amour m'acquitte, mon cur y est en pénitence
Je n'pense plus vengeance Ya Rabbi par ta clémence
Fais-nous prendre conscience que c'est à la fin que ça commence
Dans nos vies trop d'souffrances, trop d'méfiance et d'arrogance
Moins d'attirance pour la famille, mais pour la rue une préférence
Toi tu t'confies plus à ta mère et tu crois qu'c'est ça l'indépendance
Moi je n'ai plus ma mère, ma plus grande épreuve est son absence
Certains croyants ont tellement d'épreuves qu'ils quittent ce bas monde sans péchés
Ces épreuves qui s'abattent sur eux les expient de tous leurs péchés
J'préfère payer de mes péchés ici-bas que d'en souffrir dans l'au-delà
Celui pour qui Dieu veut du bien Il lui fait subir ces aléas
Ya Allah, j'accepte et j'encaisse jusqu'à c'qu'un jour je disparaisse
Car cette vie au fond de moi me désintéresse
Intéresse ceux qui paraissent en avoir dans l'tiroir caisse
A cette vitesse plusieurs se rabaissent, d'autres changent d'adresse
Avec tendresse acceptent des promesses pendant qu'd'autres s'engraissent
La vérité d'cette vie c'n'est pas que quitter ta tec'
L'amertume y est épaisse et la mort on n'y échappe pas d'justesse
Moi c'est O.G.B. j'ai connu l'essence de la tristesse

Non, ne pleure pas, non ne souffre plus
Si tu es dans les tourments
Remercie quand même Allah, car il y a encore
Une grande foi parmi les croyants
Si tu patientes dans cette vie-là
Mon Seigneur n'oublie pas, sois tranquille
Weshdi

Dieu t'a donné la gloire, la richesse ou le succès
Mais une épreuve peut accompagner un bienfait
Ainsi tu peux partager ou devenir avare
Comme tu peux remercier ou devenir ingrat
Souvent la solitude accompagne la réussite
Quand envie et jalousie tu suscites
C'qui t'touche c'est que ça touche même ton entourage
Dans leurs yeux tu n'lis plus l'amour mais la rage
T'es l'même mais pour eux t'as changé
T'es c't'intime qu'on traite comme un étranger
Jamais assez fidèle, jamais assez généreux
Quoiqu'tu fasses pour eux, pour eux ça rime avec peu
Là tes amis disparaissent
Non en fait seuls tes amis restent
Difficile pour toi de goûter aux fruits de l'amour
Et ce car tu ignores la saveur du mot confiance
Coincé dans ta paranoïa
Est-ce que les gens t'aiment pour c'que t'es ou seulement pour c'que t'as
Il y a des choses que l'argent n'achète pas
Des échéances que la fortune ne repousse pas
Tu peux être riche mais en mauvaise santé
Au point que ton argent t'arrives plus à l'compter
Tu peux être riche mais seul et soucieux
Quoiqu'il en soit remercie Dieu

Non, ne pleure pas, non ne souffre plus
Si tu es dans les tourments
Remercie quand même Allah, car il y a encore
Une grande foi parmi les croyants
Si tu patientes dans cette vie-là
Mon Seigneur n'oublie pas, sois tranquille
Weshdi

Tous ceux qui sont touchés par des épreuves
On pense à vous, pensez à nous

Une leçon pour la nouvelle et l'ancienne école
Que Dieu les protège, car j'veux espérer
Qu'ils vont réussir là où j'ai échoué

J'ai compris à dix-sept ans qu'il y a des priorités dans la vie
Que les gens qu'tu rencontres, sont pas forcément tes amis
Quoiqu'on dise, on parlera pour éviter l'danger
Quoiqu'on fasse c'est dans le bien que c'bas monde on voudrait changer
J'ai compris qu'il fallait pas être prétentieux ni incapable
Mais s'préserver de ce qui est blâmable
Que certains sujets importants font réfléchir
Jusqu'à atteindre l'endroit sensible qui parfois s'déchire
Responsable je l'suis et des choses j'en prends conscience
Par cette cause je sais très bien à qui j'accorde ma confiance
J'ai compris que faire du mal aux gens n'était pas bien
Que les regrets ne sont plus utiles quand la mort te parvient
Que chaque seconde nous est enlevée de notre crédit de vie
Et que ce bas monde un jour sera anéanti
Qu'il faut pas s'fier à l'apparence ni à la grandeur

A dix-huit ans j'ai compris qu'y'avait qu'deux issues
On m'a laissé entendre «soit t'es enfermé ou soit on te tue »
J'ai appris avec le temps, à donner d'l'amour
Et à effacer cette haine trop fréquente en bas des tours
J'ai compris qu'la vie, nous offrait aucun pansement
Et si les cicatrices nous blessent, ben elles s'estompent avec le temps
Trop d'mal accumulé, pour trop d'bien dissimulé
A dix-huit ans c'est toutes ces choses que j'ai assimilées
J'ai appris à être la fierté de mes parents
Oubliés les bancs d'la cité et ses comportements
Et si j'pleure, c'est qu'j'ai compris qu'un homme c'est faible
J'pleure car c'est trop tard qu'j'ai appris à demander d'l'aide
J'ai compris qu'il fallait concrétiser sa foi
Y'a qu'un seul Dieu mon frère et on se doit d'choisir sa voie
J'ai compris beaucoup d'choses, mais j'avais juste un seize
Si j'avais compris plus tôt, j'aurai été bien plus à l'aise

J'ai dix-neuf ans et j'ai compris, appris que le bitume
Tue et rime aussi avec amertume
J'ai compris la sale ambiance qui y régnait
Et ressenti la souffrance quand mon cœur saignait
J'ai compris qu'il y avait des choix à faire
Mais surtout qu'il y avait des choses à n'pas faire
J'ai vu la rue c'qui s'y passe, ses cris
Ces choses qui te dépassent, ces nuits, qui elles riment avec insomnies
D'une fausse manœuvre t'es pas à l'abri
Actes et conséquences t'es pris dans l'courant des ennuis
J'ai compris même su que la rue était un mirage
Déçu, par elle, y'a d'quoi devenir barge
Peu d'gens se soucient des devoirs qui leur incombent
Jusqu'au jour où ils se retrouvent dans leur tombe
J'ai moins de vingt ans et grâce à Dieu j'ai compris

À toutes les mères qui ne trouvent pas en leur fils
La gratitude pour tous leurs sacrifices
À toutes les soeurs qui malgré elles subissent
La rue et ses peurs qui laissent des cicatrices
Je vous raconte pas la rue et ses vices
Mais la souffrance d'une mère sans son fils
Près du coeur, loin du regard
Les mots rapprochent même si la distance sépare
Impulsion, arrestation, perquisition, incarcération

À toutes les mères qui ne trouvent pas en leur fils
La gratitude pour tous leurs sacrifices
À toutes les soeurs qui malgré elles subissent
La rue et ses peurs qui laissent des cicatrices
Toutes ses pensées s'envolent vers son fils
Visage fermé elle est triste
Et les joies sont tellement rares sous son toit

Car il y a des absences qu'on ne remplace pas
Déception, désillusion, incompréhension

À toutes les mères qui ne trouvent pas en leur fils
La gratitude pour tous leurs sacrifices
À toutes les soeurs qui malgré elles subissent
La rue et ses peurs qui laissent des cicatrices
À toutes les mères qui ont supporté la difficulté des parloirs
Sur qui tous ces hommes peuvent compter, leur dernier espoir
Il ne leur reste que leur famille
Quand dans la solitude leur coeur vacille
Visite, courrier et mandats
La rue déserte les siens sont là
À toutes les femmes

À toutes les mères qui ne trouvent pas en leur fils
La gratitude pour tous leurs sacrifices
À toutes les soeurs qui malgré elles subissent
La rue et ses peurs qui laissent des cicatrices

Et les joies sont tellement rares sous son toit

Kery James,"Lève ton bras en l'air que j'vienne chanter la vérité
Ce qui éclaire les coeurs des ténèbres vers la guidée
La croyance pure sur laquelle se sont rassemblés

La louange est à Allah, le Seigneur des Mondes
Je Témoigne qu'il n'est de dieu que Lui
Le Créateur de tout autre que Lui
Celui Que je prie pour qu'Il m'accorde le paradis
Il existe il n'y a aucun doute
Ce monde même témoigne de Son existence
Regarde autour de toi, ouvre ton cur
Toutes ces belles choses nécessitent un Créateur
Il a toujours existé, on dit de Lui qu'Il est de toute éternité
Par le temps Il n'est pas concerné
Voilà pourquoi on ne dit pas ""Quand"" à à son sujet
Il a créé le ciel et la terre
Le paradis le Trône et l'enfer
Nous croyons qu'Il est le Créateur des endroits
Sans exception et quels qu'ils soient
Dieu n'occupe pas un espace
Il n'est pas localisé, il faut qu' tu l'saches
Et comprennes que Dieu n'est pas partout diffus comme l'air
Ni dans le cur de Ses adorateurs sincères
Dieu existe avant les endroits
C'qui prouve que Son existence n'en dépend pas
Les six directions ne L'englobent pas
Il ne change pas, Dieu existe toujours sans endroit
On ne dit pas "" où "" à Son sujet
Car le ""où"" c'est bien Lui Qui l'a créé
Celui qui est dans un endroit a une limite
Mais Dieu n'a pas de formes ni de limites
Il n'est pas assis, ni établi
Il n'est pas dans l'ciel ni au paradis
Dois-je rappeler que la voie de droiture
C'est distinguer le Créateur des Créatures

Dieu existe et rien n'est tel que Lui
Quoique tu puisses imaginer ce n'est pas Lui
Sache que les illusions ne L'atteignent pas
Tout comme les imaginations ne L'englobent pas
Comment prétendre L'imaginer Lui
Qui existe avant la lumière et l'obscurité
En fait, nous en sommes incapables
Dieu n'est pas un corps palpable ou impalpable
Ses attributs ne sont pas ceux des êtres humains
Il n'a pas de visage, de pieds, ni de mains
Bien sûr nous croyons fermement en ce qui figure dans le Qour'an
Mais la langue arabe est riche mon frère, il faut qu'tu comprennes
Et retiennes que certains mots peuvent avoir plusieurs sens
On ne retient pas ceux qui impliqueraient une ressemblance
Entre le Créateur et la créature
La croyance une base, un pilier, une armure
Bien évidemment Dieu est exempt de l'organe
Pour tout musulman, cette croyance est normale
Normale car notre croyance c'est l'exemption
De Dieu, de toute ressemblance
Normale, car notre croyance c'est l'exemption
Ce n'est pas l'assimilation, ni la négation
Lève ton bras en l'air que j'vienne chanter la vérité
Celle qui éclaire les curs des ténèbres vers la guidée
La croyance pure sur laquelle se sont rassemblés
Comme un seul corps les musulmans du monde entier
Et c'est par Dieu que je recherche la protection
Contre le mal de mon âme et les déviations
Nul n'est sauvé si ce n'est par Sa préservation
Le bien comme le mal, sont par Sa création
Il n'a pas besoin de nos adorations
Il sait toute chose et Il est le Tout Puissant
N'entre en existence que ce qu'Il veut
Et ici je témoigne qu'il n'est de dieu que Dieu
Ô Allah, pardonne-moi mes péchés, bien trop nombreux
Ô Allah, guide-moi car j'voudrais quitter ce monde parmi les pieux

Kery James,"J'aurais pu dire: 2005
Avec ma carrière j’enterre le rap: contestable, j'en sors comme j'y suis entré
Avec l'induscutable l'authenticité
J'aurais pu dire qu'après moi, personne n'écoute du pe-ra zarma
Les zoulos quittent le hip-hop pour la salsa!
J'aurais pu dire: ""Sur ta platine DJ cale ça, scratch ça
cale ça, scratch ça, cale ça, scratch ça, passe ça
Qu'ils avalent ça, s'échangent ça et aillent dire aux autres c'est du rap sale ça
C'est de la balle,ca vient d'Orly, c'est le nouveau kery, ça tue et c'est normal
J'aurais pu dire, M-C j'veux t'faire taire t'es où?
T'es tellement p'tit, que ton style touche terre où qu'tu sois
Lève la tête regarde le mien plane dans les airs!
J'aurais pu dire j'fracasse, dans l'rap j'explose j'veux d'la place
Un fossé m'sépare de mes concurrents. J'électrocute, quoi? T'es pas au courant?
J'aurais pu dire dé-dégage, faut qu'on rapatrie ton rap en bouée d'sauvetage
Mon rap est flot, il flotte qle tien s'noye, il a l'gout d'chiottes tandis qu'le mien s'boit
Tu vois, j'aurais pu etre vulgaire, t'insulter jusqu'a t'provoquer un ulcère
Si j'garde la classe, le contenu, le vocabulaire
C'est qu'j'revois ton rap d'où il vient, disons, dix ans en arrière
J'aurais pu dire j't'allume, mon écriture éteint ta plume
Mais mon rap est mûr le tien est puérile
J'aurais pu dire mon rap tue, car il s'vit dans la rue, respire et transpire mon vécu
Alors d'amour il est nécessairement dépourvu
J'aurais pu dire mon rap est réel
Comme ces règlements de compte a balles réelles dans nos ruelles
J'aurais pu dire c'est pas du Bruel, ça c'est pas l'rap des agneaux
C'est celui des cruels, des rebels, des renégats
J'aurais pu dire moi j'rap uniquement pour mes gars
Mes gars violents, insolents, inconscients, dingues ivres même au volant
J'aurai pu dire j'ai le style, de ceux qu'on survécu en milieu hostile
Style, ma rime reflète une réalité style
Elle n'est en fait qu'un miroir qu'ils cherchent à briser l'style
J'aurais pu dire j'ai l'argent les armes et les hommes
Alors mes ennemis j'les piège mets les armes et dégomme
J'aurai pu dire c'est oeil pour oeil, dent pour dent
Car au fond n'ai-je pas la mafia africaine dans le sang
J'aurais pu dire j'suis 9-4, 9-4 dans mon coeur mes pensées mes actes style
Block C4 magnum et M-16 style tu peux pas, tu peux pas test des mecs, tu pèses?
J'aurais pu dire que d'où j'viens, tu serre la main à tes futurs assassins
Tu peux être fort et compter parmi les braves
Tu peux t'faire tuer sans jamais être au fait marave
J'aurais pu dire qu'on a pas choisi
On était tous condamnés d'Marseille a Choisy
J'aurais pu dire tout est d'la faute du gouvernement
J'aurais pu éloigner les miens du discernement
J'aurais pu dire j'n'aime pas la police
Tous corrompu tous racistes, mais au fond est-ce vrai?
En évitant la question parais-je plus vrai?

J'aurais pu dire toutes ces conneries
Mais dans nos rues y a trop d'pleures et y a trop d'cris
Trop d'larmes, trop d'drames, trop d'meurtres, trop d'injustice dans l'monde
C'est pourquoi j'utilise mon micro comme un sabre
Au service de la justice, au service de la vérité
J'veux mourir avec la certitude d'avoir été utile au gens et pour ça
J'peux pas toujours leur dire c'qu'ils veulent entendre
J'navigue à contre-courant, et ma musique est fidèle a mes convictions
J'suis loin d’être parfait
Je l'sais, je l'crois, je l'dis, je l'vis, je l'chante
Mais j'suis sincère et si j'me trompe
J'n'hésite pas à revenir sur ma position

Mais moi je sais que : c'est ça être un bonhomme

Kery James,"Certains m'aiment, d'autres me détestent
Mais au fond combien me connaissent réellement?
Combien m'aiment vraiment?
Combien seront présents à mon enterrement?
A ma mort, combien se réjouiront sincèrement?
Je me demande combien vont pleurer mon absence
Me regretter jusqu'à en perdre leur propre présence
Combien cacheront mes défauts, mes secrets?
Combien m'auront aimé en secret?
Combien viendront visiter ma famille?
Quand elle sera ébranlée, amputée et fragile
Combien porteront conseil à ma petite sœur?
Avec sincérité, vertu et douceur
Combien lui rappelleront à quel point je l'aimais?
Combien écriront à quel point je peinais?
Saignais, tant ce monde me blesse
J'y suis comme un étranger, j'attends que la vie me laisse
Je vais surement quitter ce monde comme j'y suis venu, seul
Je vais certainement mourir comme j'ai vécu, seul
Mes paroles sont dures comme ma vie
Sans amour, vide comme un corps sans vie

Combien m'aiment réellement, malgré ce que je suis?
Combien me regretterons, quand je quitterais cette vie?
Combien m'ont entendu, mais ne m'ont pas compris?
Combien de temps, avant qu'on m'oublie?

Combien sont rentrées dans ma vie?
Radieuses comme le soleil
Illuminant mes jours, la nuit troublant mon sommeil
Alors j'ai espérer pouvoir changer
Aimer sans retenue, sans me sentir en danger
Pourquoi n'était-ce qu'un mirage?
Un vent de bonheur précédent l’ouragan de rage
C'est fou comme on peut se tromper
C'est fou comme on peut se tromper
Une même phrase pour deux sens différents
Que chacun peut interpréter selon son expérience
L'amour, une plante que je n'arrive plus à semer
Je me suis perdu au jardin des désabusés
Combien m'ont côtoyé mais ne m'ont pas connu?
Pour combien d'entre-elles resterais-je un inconnu?
Combien m'ont écouté mais ne m'ont pas compris?
Combien m'ont donné de l'espoir mais me l'ont repris?
Combien de cœurs j'ai brisés?
Combien j'en ai déçu?
Combien de cœurs j'ai gagné?
Presque autant que j'en ai perdu
Le monde m'a volé ma confiance
Ôté du berceau de l'insouciance!

Combien m'aiment vraiment?
Combien m'aiment vraiment?

Je dédis ce morceau à tous ceux qui peu à peu perdent confiance en la confiance
Retrouvez-moi au jardin des désabusés
Il y a quand même des gens qui nous aiment réellement, vraiment
Je dédis ce morceau à ma petite sœur, Cassandra
A mon petit frère Kevin et à ma mère
Quand je serai KO comme Alain Souchon
Descendu des plateaux, trop hauts
Et qu'il ne restera que mes chansons
Combien, combien seront encore à mes cotés?
Combien m'aiment vraiment?",Combien
Kery James,"Mes fautes sont lourdes car mes défauts sont graves
Je suis venu en éclaireur, pourtant mon coeur est en naufrage
Je suis qu'un aveugle qu'ils prennent pour guide
Rien qu'un homme que le diable a pris pour cible
Mes péchés sont nombreux
Tellement nombreux que je peux pas les dénombrer
J'peux qu'espérer que Dieu me pardonne
Qu'il m'accorde le repentir avant que ma dernière heure sonne
J'écris peut-être l'un de mes textes les plus poignants
Car à cette heure ma vie semble prendre un tournant
Les tourments font suite aux rebondissements
Comme quoi, toi comme moi, on est pas à l'abri du changement
Mais au fond ai-je vraiment changé?
Je dois constater que pour moi même je reste un danger
Je te jure la foi c'est tout ce que j'ai
Si j'la perds, frère, j'perds tout ce que j'ai

J'ai mis ma vie, en feu de détresse
J'attends une aide, qui tarde à me venir
J'suis envahi, par mes faiblesses
Au point d'ignorer, ce qu'Alix Mathurin va devenir

L'avenir me paraît sombre
Le soleil brille toujours pourtant je sombre
Plus rien de certain si ce n'est la tombe
Je distingue plus mon chemin y'a trop d'ombre
J'ai fait ce que je pouvais
A défaut d'avoir accompli c'que j'voulais
Je suis étonné d'être encore debout
Et parfois envers c'que j'fais, j't'avoue, j'ai du dégoût
J'me fais peur, j'suis à plaindre
Et si j'baissais les bras j'serais à craindre
Avec ce qu'il reste de moi, je me bats
Et avant tout ce sont mes pulsions que j'combats
Avec ce qu'il reste de moi je lutte
Je m'accroche, mais malgré moi je chute
Avec ce qu'il reste de lui, jusqu'où
Alix Mathurin pourra tenir le coup

Parfois j'ai l'impression que je n'y arriverai pas
Et là je n'ai plus envie de me battre, mais de baisser les bras
Crois-moi, le combat contre le mal est sans répit, intense
Il fait mal, déchire, comme un couteau dans une plaie
J'me vide, j'me perds, mon coeur saigne
J'appelle à l'aide mais je trouve personne qui puisse
Apaiser mes peines
Même pas une épaule sur laquelle je pourrais me reposer
Trop de pressions accumulées, un jour j'pourrais exploser
Trop exposé au danger, je suis au bord du gouffre
Les nerfs à vif, à cran, j'pourrais devenir ouf
Scotché a mon lit, j'ai peine à m'lever
J'me dis qu'y a 2 ans, j'aurais souhaité crever
Excusez moi mais je traverse une tempête
A bord d'un navire que je n'ai même pas l'droit de déserter
J'trouve pas de médecin qui puisse enfin guérir mes maux
Et combien comprendront mes lettres derrière ces mots
Ce texte, récit d'un homme qui a beaucoup perdu
Peut être même d'un chercheur qui s'est perdu
Pardonnez moi si je n'suis pas à la hauteur
Si j'ramène la honte plutôt que l'honneur
Pardonnez moi si j'ramène la défaite plutôt que la victoire
L'incertitude plutôt que l'envie d'croire
Moi j'ai fait c'que j'pouvais
A défaut d'avoir accompli c'que j'voulais

J'ai mis ma vie, en feu de détresse
J'attends une aide, qui tarde à me venir
J'suis envahi, par mes faiblesses
Au point d'ignorer, ce qu'Alix Mathurin va devenir",En Feu de Detresse

Ghetto super classe
Ghetto super classe
Ghetto super classe
Ghetto super classe

Avoir la Ghetto super classe c'est
Partir du bas
Sans ôter le pantalon ni les bas
Parvenir au but
Mais rester droit
Sans être injuste
Tout en défendant ses droits
Jusqu'à accéder à la ghetto super ascension
Une fois au sommet : Ghetto super attention
Car la ghetto super classe implique
De faire profiter les siens ainsi que
De ne pas renier d'où tu viens
Même si
Comme Ärsenik tu deviens une Ghetto super star
Et que tu dois évoluer en bourgeois super costard
Reste Ghetto super simple
Ghetto super humble
Tout en conservant ta Ghetto super rage de vaincre
Car la vie est parfois Ghetto super dangereuse
Ton âme guerrière Ghetto super courageuse
Faut s'accrocher, reste en place
Conserver la Ghetto super classe

Ghetto Super feeling
ça se ressent
Pas besoin de te la raconter
ça se ressent
Tu dégages un truc qui fait que ça se ressent
La Ghetto Super Classe c'est
être posé
Quelque soit l'interlocuteur
Savoir causer
Jamais, jamais trop en faire
Savoir doser
élégant, sympa, mais capable d'exploser
Avoir la Ghetto Super Classe c'est
Rester le même en R5 ou en classe C
Ne pas être ingrat savoir remercier
Bosser, jamais emprunter sans rembourser

Kery James,"Comme dans le passé j'vais revendiquer
Ce qui importe pour moi c'est la vérité
C'qui ne va pas, j'vais de l'indiquer
Lève ton bras car là j'vais m'appliquer!
Regards vifs, oeil critique, c'est avec pertinence que je revendique
Sur ce ponky beat, à l'ancienne, DJ Mehdi scratch moi

J'revendique et j'dis qu'il y a trop de paprasses
Pour s'inscrire aux Assedic ou à la CAF
Encore plus galère pour un appart
Sans fausses fiches de paies tu t'en sors aps
C'est comme si on poussait les gens à tricher
Rares sont ceux qui gagnent 3 fois le prix du loyer
Voyez, les gens, sous les dettes, sont broyés, noyés
Qu'est ce que vous croyez?
Ca y est ils ont la tête sous l'eau, n'y arrivent pas
Même avec un boulot ne s'en sortent pas
Les gens vivent sous crédit, c'est dit, à mes cotés: Teddy , Medhi, Boobacar
Et j'suis reparti!
J'revendique et j'dis qu'avec l'Euro, tout a augmenté
J'ai l'impression que les commerçants ont bien grattés
On a voulu nous faire croire que les prix n'ont pas changés
Mais j'ai des yeux pour voir, et j'sais compter
J'ressens le vide dans mes poches, tout le monde se plaint
Des plus éloignés aux plus proches
C'est la crise, les gens sont dans la rue
Font face aux élus, plus de retraite, plus de Sécu
T'as, t'as vu ça, la France change
Et j't'assure que les plus pauvres ne gagnent pas au change
Donc j'revendique avec sincérité et de ma bouche ne s'échappe que vérité

Frangin faut que tu lèves ta main
Quand Kery James revendique et s'implique
J'texplique, t'as le fond et la forme
Le contenu, l'instru, ça tue et sais tu
Que d'Orly jusqu'à Garges les Gonesses
Dans ces revendications, tout les gens s'y reconnaissent
Demande leur, Kery James ils connaissent
Rappeur authentique véridique et honnête

J'revendique et j'dis que certains flics
Ont la langue légère et la gâchette facile
Et quand abusivement ils tuent, ils sont mutés
Provisoirement suspendus mais jamais détenus
Ainsi ils ne prennent que du sourcis
Pour avoir injustement retiré une vie
'Tin, t'as vu ça ceci, pousse mes frères à croire
Qu'il y a une justice pour les arabes et les noirs
J'revendique et j'dis qu'il y a trop de mômes
Qui insultent la police pour que dalle
S'comportent dans la rue en vandales
Donc t'étonnes pas que Le Pen souhaiterait
Qu'on les remballent
J'revendique et j'indique que certains jeunes
Contribuent à la montée du racisme dans nos rues
Vu qu'ils alimentent la peur chez les français
Entre les deux France, creusent le fossé
J'revendique dans l'immédiat
Et dis que les médias ont faussés les dernières élections présidentielles
Tu te rapelles, l'insécurité comme générique
Ils ont maintenus la France dans la panique
Qu'ils s'étonnent pas que les gens aient votés FN
Puisqu'ils ont confirmé Jean Marie Le Pen
Ils disent, immigration dans nos banlieues
Et banlieue = vol drogue et violence
Que veux tu que le français moyen pense?
J'dis qu'il y a eu trafic d'influence
Les français se sont fait manipuler
De ma bouche ne s'échappe que vérité

Frangin faut que tu lèves ta main
Quand Kery James revendique et s'implique
J'texplique, t'as le fond et la forme
Le contenu, l'instru, ça tue et sais tu
Que d'Orly jusqu'à Garges les Gonesses
Dans ces revendications, tout les gens s'y reconnaissent
Demande leur, Kery James ils connaissent
Rappeur authentique véridique et honnête

Bon, là j'revendique pour l'Afrique
Juste une question
Où est passé notre fric?
Une terre si riche en matière première
Et maintenant, du monde, on serait le tiers
Ils se sont emparés de nos richesses
En échange de coups de fouet et ce qu'ils laissent
Aux miens, c'est une mémoire d'esclave
Même aujourd'hui ils tuent nos braves
Plus de 400 ans d'esclavage et l'Afrique
Envers eux, aurait une dette?
Faut être bête ou peu honnête
Pour pas reconnaître qu'il ya là une incohérence
L'Occident étend son influence
Qui proteste, paye pour son imprudence
Organisation de coups d'états
Assassinats ciblés et vendettas
L'Afrique n'se relève pas, son économie se redresse pas
Car en ce qui concerne ses chefs d'états
Il faut admettre qu'ils ont un fort penchant pour la corruption
Mais là aussi, t'inquiètes j'ai des revendications
Comment ces hommes osent trahir leur nation?
Le fric vaut-il mieux que l'Honneur?
Ont-ils troqués la paix pour une autre heure?
J'revendique et j'indique
Qu'il y a trop de noirs qui sont restés prisonniers de leur histoire
Esclaves du passé comme au présent
Incapables d'aller de l'avant
Je revendique, J'indique qu'à mon sens
Nécessairement, le rap doit avoir un sens
Puisqu'il a sans aucun doute, une influence
Une conséquence sur ce que sont nos jeunes
La vie ce n'est pas que fric, flic et gun
Ce n'est pas tout noir, comme ce n'est pas tout fun
Ainsi quand j'prends le micro et que j'revendique
C'est que j'ai conscience du poids des mots

Frangin faut que tu lèves ta main
Quand Kery James revendique et s'implique
J'texplique, t'as le fond et la forme
Le contenu, l'instru, ça tue et sais tu
Que d'Orly jusqu'à Garges les Gonesses
Dans ces revendications, tout les gens s'y reconnaissent
Demande leur, Kery James ils connaissent
Rappeur authentique véridique et honnête",Je Revendique
Kery James,"Dois-je croire qu'ils ont envahi l'Irak pour y rétablir la justice?
Chasser la tyrannie et l'injustice?
Mais, où sont les armes de destructions massives
De Saddam, qui leur permis de justifier leur offensive?
Quelles sont les preuves claires et explicites
Que l'Irak, a appuyé et financé les terroristes?
Quels sont les liens entre le peuple irakien
Et cet attentat sanglant du 11 septembre 2001?
A ce jour il n'y en a pas, ils n'ont même pas
Eté, capables, de les fabriquer
Ils ont démontré au monde entier
Qu'on peut opposer la force à la vérité
Ecoute les, au nom de la démocratie mais au fond pour le pétrole
Leurs tanks avancent, subitement leurs avions décollent
Il pleut des bombes sur les civils et les maisons
Qui voudrait m'faire croire que leur folie a une raison?
Ni enfants, ni femmes ne sont épargnés
On découvrira plus tard les charniers
Leurs frappes ne sont pas chirurgicales
Leur but est malsain donc leurs moyens sont sales
Après la destruction
Ils se disputent pour le partage de la reconstruction
Ils font main basse sur l'exploitation
Du pétrole, c'est le prix de la libération
Ils apportent, les problèmes ils ont les solutions
C'est le principe, du racket et de l'extorsion de fonds
A la Maison Blanche depuis l'arrivée des Faucons
On a plutôt tendance à prendre les gens pour des vrais cons
On parle plus d'information mais de propagande
Brandissant sans cesse les événements du 11 septembre
C'est sûr, c'est une tragédie
Que je condamne fermement, maintenant c'est dit
Mais ça leur donne pas le droit de bafouer les droits et l'honneur
Ces tortures en Irak une horreur
T'as vu ces hommes à même le sol, nus
Tenus en laisse comme des chiens détenus
Dans des conditions indécentes
Je trouve cette situation inquiétante
Détenus dans des conditions indécentes
J'trouve cette situation alarmante

Souhaitent voir couler le sang des innocents?
Que face à l'injustice ils s'réjouissent?
Que chacun d'entre eux cachent un terroriste?
Vas-tu croire que l'Islam
N'a pas préservé le droit des femmes?
Vas-tu croire c'qu'ils veulent que tu crois?
Vas-tu être c'qu'ils veulent que tu sois?
Ou vas-tu te forger ta propre opinion?
Vont-ils t'imposer leur propre vision?
Es-tu de ceux qui suivent, dont ils se servent?
Ou de ceux qui réfléchissent, analysent et qui savent
On vit à une époque de manipulation
Les yeux ne suffisent plus pour déceler l'information
Les extrémistes de toute part, alimentent les tensions
Attention, vers un choc des cultures nous marchons
Vas-tu croire que l'ONU, est résolu
A faire appliquer toutes ses résolutions?
Qu'elle reste ferme, face à toute les nations
Ou qu'elle n'est guère qu'une cour de récréation
Où les plus puissants s'imposent
N'obéissent que si ça arrange leur cause
Une cour, où les plus puissants s'imposent
N'obéissent que si ça arrange leur cause
Ouvre grand les yeux et reste vigilant
Ne cède pas à ce monde de plus en plus violent
Les dirigeants nous volent et les médias nous mentent
J'peux pas m'taire, car j'suis d'la résistance

Faut pas nous prendre pour des tebés

Tambour, cymbale, tymbale, grosse caisse, cloche, synthé
Rien à changé
J'combat toujours l'injustice
D'où qu'elle vienne, qu'importe d'où qu'elle provient
Vas pas dire que j'suis anti-américain
Moi, c'qui m'importe c'est la vérité
C'qui m'importe c'est la vérité
Ne pas dire que j'reviens hardcore
On peut pas faire plus hardcore que ""Si c'était à refaire""

On ne s'entend pas car dans le fond, on rêve d'être comme les autres
Vivre d'une mélodie fluide et sans fausses notes
Mais ne vois-tu pas que finalement on ne se dit rien
On reste ensemble car sentimentalement, il le faut bien
Tu n'entends pas ma souffrance, ni la haine de la routine
J'ai peur que ton amour puisse devenir une chevrotine
On s'entend pas et c'est peut-être ce que je désir
Toujours te contredire pour qu'enfin tu veuilles me fuir

Parce qu'on a manqué de sincérité
Parce qu'on a déguisé la vérité
Parce qu'on a pas fait preuve de compassion
Parce qu'on a trop souffert du manque d'attention (on arrive plus à s'entendre)

Parce qu'on a manqué de sincérité
Parce qu'on a déguisé la vérité
Parce qu'on a pas fait preuve de compassion
Parce qu'on a trop souffert du manque d'attention (on arrive plus à s'entendre)

On arrive plus à s'entendre, c'est de ma faute, j'fais pas de concession
Et faut lutter pour m'arracher mes confessions
Je suis perdu moi-même, j'arrive pas à me comprendre
C'est peut-être que je donne peu alors que j'veux tout prendre
On s'entend pas, on s'crit dessus, mais on s'parle pas
Et quand on parle de toutes façons, on s'cromprends pas
On se ressemble pas, lequel de nous deux à tricher? 
Parce qu'on se redécouvre comme si nous étions deux étrangers
Et finalement, on a peu de choses en commun
Franchement j'étouffe sous le poids de notre vie en commun
C'est pas de ta faute, la solitude est devenue ma compagne
Maintenant où que j'aille, elle m'accompagne
A cause d'elle, en amour, j'suis trop bizarre
J'suis flou comme le brouillard, froid comme le blizzard

Est-c'que tu peux me sentir? 
Est-c'que tu peux essayer de comprendre c'que j'peux ressentir? 
Tu comprends pas mon histoire, t'as beau la connaître, tu comprends pas mon histoire
T'arrives pas à m'anticiper, t'arriveras pas à me garder
Car t'arrives pas à me deviner

Parce qu'on a manqué de sincérité
Parce qu'on a déguisé la vérité
Parce qu'on a pas fait preuve de compassion

Parce qu'on a pas fait preuve de compassion
Parce qu'on a trop souffert du manque d'attention (on arrive plus à s'entendre)

On arrive plus à s'entendre car j'ai décidé de me battre
J'avoue, j'ai délaissé ma bande pour me délecté de Rap
J' n'ai plus beaucoup d'amis mais dans le fond c'est pas plus mal
Amitié vitale, je les aime et ils le savent
On arrive plus à s'entendre et je saigne car tu m'as blessé
Tes mots ont dépassé la pensée
C'est c'que tu m'dis mais j'arrive pas à le croire
Ton amitié tu la cris, mais j'arrive pas à la voir (vas-y dis un mot) 
Avec les autres on ne s'entend pas, peut-être car Dieu m'en sort
On envie mes scores, on envie mon or
On s'entend plus, nan, car j't'ai confié un secret
Que j'ai appris par les autres que ta langue était une traître
On arrive plus à s'entendre, dans le vacarme de l'hypocrisie
Dans la symphonie maladive de la jalousie
On ne s'entend plus car tu ne m'as pas pardonné
A pars mes regrets, j'ai plus rien à te donner
On ne s'entend plus et on ne parle jamais sans tendre (pa sur pr le mot) 
Tu voulais que je me plante, dans mon dos, t'es venu me descendre
On s'entend pas car ma passion est sans limite
Ne comprend que les vrais amis qui veulent que je guérisse
On arrive plus à se comprendre
On arrive plus à se comprendre
On arrive pas s'entendre
À s'entendre
Peut-être qu'un jour on finira par même se descendre. 
Y a peu de tendresse entre nous, j'deviends ton reflet 
Nouvel ennemie, ex refré
On s'entend pas car toi t'avances avec aigreur
Moi je grimpe les épreuves et sans ma rage dans mes heures
On s'entend pas car tu ne sais pas qui je suis
T'as trop dû écouter les gens, t'as fais la connerie des les suivre

Sincérité, Vérité, on arrive plus à s'entendre
Sincérité, vérité, parce que

Parce qu'on a manqué de sincérité
Parce qu'on a déguisé la vérité

Kery James,"Et tous les gens des cités lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les enfants d'immigrés lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des quartiers chauds lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des ghettos lèvent leurs mains

Les miens, Arabes et Noirs pour la plupart d'entre eux
J'ai grandi parmi eux, je connais leur histoire
Dans l'oubli de moi-même j'écris leurs mémoires
J'les aime, j'te prie d'y croire
J'ai tant chanté leurs souffrances
Eux, ces Français pourtant étrangers en France
Je n'ignore pas que profonde est leur déchirure
La mienne, je tente de soigner par l'écriture
Bien sûr que j'ai en moi une part d'eux
Bien que j'étouffe cette rage qu'ils cultivent en banlieue
Et c'est toujours de la tristesse que tu peux lire dans mes yeux
Et tant de tendresse qui se manifeste de mes vœux
Envers ces habitants des quartiers, banlieues, cités
Trop cités, qu'on a souhaité lier à l'insécurité
Leur différence naît dans le regard des autres
Parfois conséquence: la violence et autre
J'viens de la banlieue, une France à part
Et y a pas que la distance qui nous sépare
La cité a ses codes, son langage, son silence, ses modes
Ses méthodes et sa lecture de monde

Lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les enfants d'immigrés lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des quartiers chauds lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des ghettos lèvent leurs mains

C'est vrai que parmi les miens il y a des dealers
Des tueurs et des braqueurs
Des crapuleux mais aussi des durs au grand cœur
Des étudiants, des patrons et des sportifs
Y a, des innocents et des fautifs
Nos rues sont pleines de talents cachés
Transformés en talents gâchés
Sous-estimant la valeur du temps
Je me pose une question:
""Les miens sont-ils naïfs ou inconscients?""
Lorsque l'envie domine leur raison
Je vois les miens en vie, mais en prison
De toute façon, mêmes libres, ils se sentent comme prisonniers
Rejettent le bon sens comme un fou que t'essaie de raisonner
Torturés par les regrets
J'crois que les miens pleurent mais en secret
Ils sont si loin qu'ils n'arrivent plus à revenir;
C'qu’ils voudraient être, ils n'arrivent plus à l'devenir
Ils refusent un avenir sans oseille
Souvent victimes d'une adolescence sans modèle
En bas des tours, le temps leur échappe
Leurs vies se consument
Splif au bec, regard noir, avenir confus
Et certains tapent dans la coke
Mais la plupart t’diront que c’est jamais eux mais les autres
Combien des miens ne sont pas c’qu’ils voulaient être
Ne font pas ce qu’ils voulaient faire
Ne vivent pas ce qu’ils voulaient vivre
Ils se croient condamnés à l’échec
L’inégalité sociale comme prétexte
En fait, la délinquance, un héritage maudit
Que les plus vieux leur lèguent depuis leur plus jeune âge
Alors combien peuvent s’en sortir
Construire, partir
Ou alors partir pour construire
Pour revenir, pour reconstruire et instruire les nôtres?

Lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des cités lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les enfants d’immigrés lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des quartiers chauds lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des ghettos lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les fils de prolétaires lèvent leurs mains
Tous ceux qui se sentent solidaires lèvent leurs mains
Et tous ceux de la France d’en bas lèvent leurs mains
Lèvent leurs mains

Ça me tue de voir les miens s’entretuer
Tirer, tuer, trop s’y sont habitués
Pourtant nos histoires sont les mêmes
Et quand on se fait face
On est comme face à face à nous-mêmes
On a la rage pour les mêmes raisons
On subit les mêmes exclusions
Reclus dans les mêmes quartiers
Enfermés dans les mêmes prisons
Nos parents ont fait preuve du même courage
Nous aiment du même amour
Alors pourquoi tu me dévisage?
Tandis que les médias nous salissent
Que certains nous trahissent
Complotent, rêvent en secret que la France nous bannisse
Dans leur bouche, avant, on était des voleurs
Maintenant, dans leurs reportages on est tous des violeurs
On violerait nos sœurs à plusieurs
On y verrait une justice, une fierté, un honneur
Tu sais ce qu’ils se disent, normal pour des extrémistes en puissance
La haine succède à la peur et eux veulent faire flipper la France
Frangin, lève ta main si t’as une sœur et que tu la respecte
Lève ta main si t’as un frère et qu’il te respecte
Lève ta main si t’es conscient que la cité peut être un drame
Que tu sois un homme ou une femme

Lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des cités lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les enfants d'immigrés lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des quartiers chauds lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les gens des ghettos lèvent leurs mains
Et tous les fils de prolétaires lèvent leurs mains
Tous ceux qui se sentent solidaires lèvent leurs mains
Et tous ceux de la France d’en bas lèvent leurs mains
Lèvent leurs mains

Celle-ci c’est pour tous les gens des quartiers
Banlieues, cités qu’on a souhaité lier à l’insécurité
Afrique du nord, du sud, Antilles, Europe, Espagnols, Portugais
La misère n’a pas de couleur
Au royaume des rêves brisés, des cœurs brisés
Des sentiments maîtrisés
Quand ils ne sont pas méprisés
Ton sens de la survie doit y être aiguisé
C’est en rage, que les faiblesses sont déguisées
Les miens n’en n’ont pas l’air, mais ils sont épuisés
Les miens, je vais les représenter jusqu’au dernier",Les Miens
Kery James,"J'voudrais que mes potes soient encore en vie
J'voudrais goûter à leurs sourires
Ils me manquent, j'voudrais déguster leurs fou rires
J'voudrait par une journée ensoleillée
Contempler notre amitié, vivre et crier
Jusqu'à étouffer nos rinceurs
Qu'on soit unis en harmonie comme un seul coeur
Qu'on partage les succès et les efforts
Et si on souffre qu'on souffre comme un seul corps
Toutes les banlieues se ressemblent
Alors j'voudrais que toutes les banlieues se rassemblent
Qu'ensemble on défendent nos droits
Qu'ensemble ils nous entendent comme une seule voix
Puis-je encore rêver?
Moi qui suis plutôt du genre à œuvrer
dur de conserver l'espoir malgré la douleur de mon histoire

Laisser moi m'élever
C'est tout ce qu'il me reste, laisser moi rêver
Même si ce monde nous a fait prisonnier
nos espoirs ne doivent pas être emprisonnés

J'voudrais trouver la femme de ma vie
qu'elle m'aime, me comprenne, m'enseigne la confiance, me surprenne et m’apprenne
J'voudrais qu'elle sache m'anticiper
Que j'puisse enfin épanouir entre harmonie et paix 
J'voudrais que son sourire illumine ma vie 
Il est clair, loyal, sincère
J'la voudrais que sa douceur étouffe ma colère 
Qu'elle rayonne même quand y a de l'orage dans l'air 
Qu'elle tue ma solitude, bouleverse ma vie, mes avis, mes habitudes 
Que j'puisse avoir l'impression de voler sans ailes 
Que j'connaisse le sens de l'expression: sans elle 
Mais, puis-je encore rêver?
J'ai l'impression d'avoir déjà tant œuvrer 
Dur de conserver l'espoir malgré la douleur de mon histoire 

Laisser moi m'élever 
C'est tout ce qu'il me reste, laisser moi rêver 
Même si ce monde nous a fait prisonnier 
nos espoirs ne doivent pas être emprisonnés 

J'voudrais voir triompher la justice face à l'injustice 
La générosité se manifester et faire passer l'égoïsme 
Mais j'ai du mal à rêver 
Quand j'observe la souffrance des désœuvrés 
Comment conserver l'espoir face aux coups notés de notre histoire 

N'a-t-on pas tous les mêmes rêves? 
Nos cœurs abritent les mêmes espoirs 
J'dis qu'on a tous les mêmes rêves 
nos âmes subissent le même désespoir 
 
Laisser moi m'élever
C'est tout ce qu'il me reste, laisser moi rêver 
Même si ce monde nous a fait prisonnier 
nos espoirs ne doivent pas être emprisonnés 

Laisser moi m'élever

Kery James,"Emeric, joue cette mélodie
Cette douce mélodie
Qui n'me donne pas envie de rapper
Mais juste de parler
Juste, de dire
Ce que m'inspire la vie
Car la vie est
La vie c'est

J'm'étonne quand j'me rend compte à quel point on peut aimer la vie
J'm'étonne quand je constate à quel point on est attaché à la vie
On s'y accroche, on s'y agrippe fermement, pourtant
La vie n'est pas faite que de bons moments
Et malgré tout, on l'aime
Et pour ne pas la perdre, on perdrai beaucoup

Car la vie est

La vie c'est comme ces fruits, dont le gout est sucré, puis soudainement amers
Elle n'est ni noire, ni blanche, non... Elle est beaucoup plus complexe que cela
C'est un remarquable mélange de douces saveurs, à d'autre, fortement épicées
Un métissage entre le bien et le mal, entre l'agréable et le détestable
Entre l'acceptable et l'inacceptable, entre le vrai et le faux, entre l'illusion et la réalité
Entre l'espoir et la crainte

La vie peut être comme un film sans surprise
Car il peut nous sembler que ses jours se suivent et se répètent
Se suivent, se répètent et se ressemblent
Se suivent, se répètent et s'ajoutent les uns aux autres
Mais parfois, Parfois
La vie te surprend, te renoue, te secoue
Les vagues de son agitation te submergent d'émotions
L'action succède au calme, le silence est recouvert par le vacarme
Les choses se bousculent, tout va presque trop vite, te laissant peu de temps de réflexion
Les éclairs de la vie foudroient la monotonie de ton existence
La tempête de la vie dévaste tes habitudes
Tandis que son vent désoriente tes points de vue
Car la vie pour nous, ce sont les changements:
On aime, on aime plus, On se sent bien, on se sent mal
Du bien-être, on passe au mal être, Des pleurs, on passe à la joie
De la joie aux larmes de tristesse, Puis des larmes de tristesse aux larmes des éclats de rire :
La vie quoi

La vie n'est pas la même pour tous, à bas la démagogie. Non, on ne nait pas tous égaux
On ne s'engage pas dans la bataille de la vie avec les mêmes armes

Car la vie c'est

Les pauvres et les riches, les beaux et les laids
Les gens drôles, intelligents, captivants, brillants!
Et les gens vides, insignifiants, qui semblent n'avoir rien à nous apprendre

Peut-on parler de vie sans parler d'amour
Mais, peut-on parler d'amour sans parler de souffrance?
Non, excusez moi, dans amour c'est vrai qu'on peut aussi entendre confiance, soutien et consolation
Pourtant on s'aime, on se déteste, on s'aime, on se déteste
On se quitte, on se rattrape, on se rattrape
Mais on s'aime plus
On se quitte on se rattrape, on se rattrape on se quitte, alors qu'on s'aime encore
On se quitte, on se rattrape, on s'aime, on se déteste
Pour finalement admettre que la vie c'est
Nous deux

La vie c'est les rencontres et les rupture
Les liens qui se fragilisent, rongés par le temps
Les ex-amis qui deviennent nouveaux ennemis
Et dont la préoccupation première est de nuire
La vie c'est des sourires hypocrites
Des poignées de mains peu sincères
Des ""je t'aime"" sans profondeur
Des au revoir qu'on souhaiterait secrètement être des adieux
La vie c'est
Ce qui est vu et ce qui est caché

Alors ma vie c'est la solitude
Le replis sur moi même dans la tour des sentiments
Car la vie c'est
La peur, la peur d'être seul
La peur de ne pas être aimé, la peur de mourir
La peur d'échouer, la peur de l'inconnu
La peur des blessures physiques et morales
Une peur se greffe à une autre, qui elle même se greffe à une autre
Et finalement on peut passer toute une vie à avoir peur
Et ça c'est dramatique

La vie c'est
La vie c'est

La vie c'est les regrets, cette impression d'avoir manqué le coche
D'avoir mal agit jusqu'à éloigner les plus proches
La vie c'est ces tournants, qu'on prend délibérément
Ou involontairement, ou inconsciemment qui nous amènent aux tourments
La vie c'est cette angoisse qui nous paralyse, perturbe notre analyse
Et c'est là que, la vie nous dévoile nos faiblesses
Elle nous apprend que seul, on est pas grand chose et qu'au fond la vie, c'est
Les autres

La vie est comme une jeu d'échecs: parfois, une partie très serrée, entre nous et nos pulsions
La vie c'est le temps qui passe, vieillir, perdre sa jeunesse, mûrir, perdre son innocence
Plus on vit et plus nos yeux s'ouvrent sur la réalité de cette vie
Et aucune fiction n'est plus intense, plus douloureuse que le film de cette vie
Et oui, vivre, c'est se rapprocher sûrement de la mort

Il y a tant de chose a dire sur cette vie
Que je pourrai noircir des kilomètre de pages blanches
Car la vie, certains meurent, sans en comprendre le sens
Comme si la vie était une question sans réponse",La Vie C'est
Kery James,"Voilà le son que j'attendais, surtout en période tendue
Moi je sors du Neuf'Quatre, j'évite les coups tordus
Depuis mon adolescence, j'évite les pièges tendus
C'est tendu, et alors? On assume quand c'est le temps du
Respect, homme de paix ouais, mais y'a un malentendu
Tout le monde devrais nous marcher dessus
J'résiste, et tu prétends être déçu
Qu'est ce que tu veux de moi? C'est toi qui me déçois
Qu'est-ce t'as? T'es fou toi
Plus question de me justifier
Re-fré ça date pas d'hier qu'ils essayent de me crucifier
Tous attendent ma chute, guettent le faux pas
Tous rêvent de dire ""Tu vois, il dit ce qu'il ne fait pas""
Tous m'attendent au tournant, avec chacun leurs raisons
Un jour j'm'exilerai parmi les Hommes de raison
Mais pour l'instant j suis là, et j'rappe sale
J'rappe tellement bien qu'on dit que j'rappe mal
J'rappe
Ah! Je traque le trac
Depuis Thug Life, je ne rappe que des massacres
Dès que je rentre dans la cabine, ça sent le classique
Si un jour on m'assassine, c'est que ça sent le plastique
J'rappe sous la pression, j'rappe sévère
J'rappe pas torse nu mais j'rappe le ventre ouvert
J'rappe vrai, j'rappe thug
J'rappe la paix en attendant que les balles pleuvent
Et vu comment c'est parti, tu sens qu'il y'aura pas de refrain
Si ce n'est à la fin alors j'rappe comme quand j'avais faim
J'rappe comme quand j'avais rien, d'ailleurs je n'ai toujours pas grand-chose
Pour faire des thunes je n'ai jamais choisi les bonnes causes
Hey, hey hey-hey, tu veux le peu que j'ai
Tu joues avec de l'essence, garçon c'est du feu que j'ai
Tout ce que j'ai acquis, je ne l'ai volé a personne
Et quoi que disent les on-dit, je n'ai trompé personne
Un homme a ses faiblesses, s'ils ne peuvent pas le comprendre
C'est peut-être qu'ils sont parfaits, ou qu'ils ne veulent pas l'entendre
Tous émettent des jugements sans les connaissances qui l'leurs permettent
Tous ont foi en Internet
Bienvenue dans le Game, tout le monde veut le Name
Mais le premier qui règne peut craindre le Rain
Tous sont persuadés qu'il n y'a pas de place pour tout le monde
Pour être au-dessus tout le monde, tout le monde veut écraser tout le monde
Insulter tout le monde, piétiner tout le monde
Humilier tout le monde, s'il le faut : buter tout le monde
Moi c'n'est pas ma vision, c'n'est pas ma croyance, c'n'est pas mon monde
Mais malgré tout ça, j'aimerai encore rassembler tout le monde
J'n'espère plus qu'ils me comprennent, je continue le combat
Il neige des complots, j'slalome entre les coups bas
Mon drapeau est peace, mais peace avec Justice
Tu me trouveras en face de ceux qui pissent sur la justice
Qu'est ce que tu veux? J'suis comme ça
Qu'est ce que tu veux? C'est comme ça que je donne ça

J'rappe pour R.O.H.2.F, je pleure nos erreurs
J'rappe pour Fresnes, j'rappe pour Fleury
J'rappe pour Nanterre, la Santé et Bois d'Arcy
J'rape pour m'apaiser alors j'rappe ma furie
J'entend le public crier ""Je suis Mafia K'1 Fry!""

Chut, j'rappe comme ils chuchotent
Empoissonnent ma vie en espérant qu'je suffoque
T'imagines même pas le poids que je supporte
Ni l'amour que je porte au peu de gens qui m'supportent
Depuis Si c'était à refaire, ils m'ont dans le collimateur
Et si je gène mon frère, ce n'est pas seulement pour ma couleur
Je ne peux pas plaire à tout le monde, surtout aux hypocrites
MC's ou journalistes que la vérité irrite
J'rappe un œil dans l'dos, le regard vers le futur
À chacune de mes blessures, j'ai un rap en point de suture
Certains n'ont que des prétextes et veulent en faire des causes
Je dis rien d'autres que de l'avarice et de la jalousie
Malgrès leurs accolades et leurs sourires sournois
À la moindre incartade, ils s'empressent de parler sur moi
Hey ce n'est pas encore mon heure
La banlieue a une voix
Je ne suis qu'un de ses hauts-parleurs! Test:
J'rappe depuis une tempête alors j'rappe des intempéries
Est-ce que j'rappe depuis un cimetière depuis que j'rappe des tueries?
T'as vu j'rap des punchlines des punchlines, depuis long time
Tu sens que le prochain album va faire mal, très mal, très mal, très mal, très mal
Test:
J'rapperai toujours la paix, mais pas sans le respect
J'rapperai l'humilité, mais jamais sans la fierté
J'rapperai jamais la haine, même si je sais que l'amour recule
J'rapperai toujours le pardon plutôt que la rancune
J'rapperai toujours l'unité, mais seulement sur des bonnes bases
Jamais avec ceux qui ne prennent du poids que lorsque qu'ils t'écrasent
Je rapperai toujours l'apaisement, enfin tant que ce sera possible
Permets-moi d'ajouter: Suis-je né pour servir de cible?
Je ne changerai pas de direction
Je pousserai toujours les petits frères vers plus d'éducation
Et si je baisse les armes, saches que j'le ferai pour eux
Ma rage n'étouffe pas l'amour que j'ai pour la banlieue
Je sais que malgré moi, ils me prennent pour exemple
Mais que personne me suive si je me trompe
Et si je deviens violent, l'Islam n'y est pour rien
Ce n'est dû qu'à mes faiblesses, j'répète pour que tu comprennes bien
Et si je deviens violent, l'Islam n'y est pour rien
Ce n'est dû qu'a mes excès, j'échoue mais j'essaie
L'humilité et l’orgueil, le tout dans un même homme
La folie et la raison, le tout dans un seul homme
Tu peux trouver une faille en moi parce que j'suis qu'un homme
Vaincra la vérité, et ce même si tu la déformes
Depuis que j'rappe ma foi, je sais que j'rappe sur des bouts de verres
J'rappe tellement sous tension, mon frère j'rappe des ulcères
J'rappe hardcore, cru, sans être vulgaire
Mon rap, c'est une mise à nu, moi j'rappe à découvert
J'rappe sincèrement, personne ne peut le nier
À chacun d'mes albums, j'espère que c'est l'dernier
T'espères que ce sera l'dernier, mais mon pote tu vas attendre
C'est à moi d'en décider, le Neuf'Quatre ne compte pas s'rendre
Voilà un autre classique, soutenu par la rue
Les poings levés, bras tendus, c'est tendu mais le combat continue

Le son le plus attendu, surtout en période tendue
C'est le son du Neuf'Quatre, évite les coups tordus
J'ai le cran du Neuf'Quatre, j'évite les pièges tendus
C'est le sang du Neuf'Quatre qui coule quand c'est tendu
Respect si t'es avec nous, t'as le bras tendu
Le combat continue contre les jaloux et les vendus
Contre les envieux et les tordus
Depuis l'temps que je tord du MC

Je sais que le silence n'est pas un oubli!

Kery James,"On a cette force de vivre, on lutte parce qu'il le faut, car on vient du ghetto
On mène une thug life mais on la vie par défaut, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
On garde la tête haute, on s'ra jamais soumis et on luttera jusqu'à demain
On a nos modes, nos codes, nos rêves, nos envies
Plus ils nous font mal et plus on est fort
On va chanter pour les jeunes des quartiers
Pour tous ceux qui restent fort
Représenter pour les jeunes des cités

Et même si l'espoir se fane, j'continuerai à chanter
Mes joies, mes larmes, ma vie, ma cause, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, on chante nos peines, nos vies, nos causes, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

Eh, j'dédie mon album à mon ghetto
Et j'dis que l'on peut faire rimer succès avec ghetto
Si ma plume réanime l'espoir du ghetto
C'est que plus que la frime c'qui m'anime c'est l'amour du ghetto
J'suis trop fier de venir du ghetto
Même si j'y ai souffert, j't'assure j'ai appris trop d'choses dans l'ghetto
Quand t'as survécu au ghetto
Tu peux faire face à c'monde car t'as l'intelligence du ghetto
N'écoutes pas tout c'qu'ils disent sur nos ghettos
La misère nous unis, ne nous divise dans le ghetto
En tout cas dans nos ghettos, malgré nos différences, on vit ensemble
Et tu n'vois ça que dans le ghetto
Pas question d'renier le ghetto
Ma carrière a été portée par le ghetto
Même si j'rêve d'emmener les miens loin du ghetto
Mon coeur battra toujours pour le ghetto

Et même si l'espoir se fane, j'continuerai à chanter
Mes joies, mes larmes, ma vie, ma cause, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, on chante nos peines, nos vies, nos causes, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

Yeah, j'suis construis mais t'inquiète j'suis ghetto
J'suis instruis mais pourtant j'viens du ghetto
J'suis ambitieux mais comme tous les mecs du ghetto
Généreux même avec peu, j'ai la mentalité du ghetto
Malgré la rage du ghetto
J'fais face au naufrage avec le courage du ghetto
Ma poésie vient du ghetto, s’élève du sol, s'envole et donne des ailes à mon ghetto
Ne parle pas que du pire quand tu parle de mon ghetto
Mais t'as pas le sourire de mon ghetto
Crimes, stups et violence, on l'sait c'est ghetto
Mais comme ça, t'as peu d'chances de sortir vivant du ghetto
J'suis trop vrai, j'ai grandis dans l'ghetto
L'illicite n'est qu'un orage dans le désert du ghetto
Casque intégral, mort brutale, ghetto

Et même si l'espoir se fane, j'continuerai à chanter
Mes joies, mes larmes, ma vie, ma cause, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, on chante nos peines, nos vies, nos causes, parce qu'on vient du ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Ouais, parce qu'on vient du ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto",Ghetto

ça fait 2-3 Générations qu'on fait les même choses
Pas de la même manière, mais on s'fout en l'air pour les mêmes causes
Les mêmes toxicos arrachent leurs mères pour les mêmes doses
Les halls changent d'aspect mais nos frères gardent les mêmes poses
Sais-tu à quoi tu t'exposes?
Si t'allumes la mèche petit frère faut bien que ça explose
Les mêmes contrats avec la rue contenant les mêmes clauses
On te bute si tu causes trop

Hey si t'arrête l'école maintenant, dès maintenant j'peux te raconter
Ce qu'il risque fort de t'arriver Béné!
Tu vas monter une équipe
Un ancien t'avancera de la coke et du shit
Pour la bicrave il t'faudra un terrain
Comme t'es jeune et brave
Tu l'obtiendra à coup de surins
Là, tu prendras la place de mecs qui sont en place depuis trop longtemps
Et qui oublient que le temps passe, mais chacun son temps
Toutes nos légendes sont mortes ou déchues, enfermées ou fichues
Parce que trop d'séjours en prison, trop d'séjours en H.P
Quand j'rap la rue, c'est précis, c'est d'la H.D
Du détail au gros, avec du cran et des gros flingues tu feras des grosses tunes
De la bac aux stups
Victime de ta réput' tout le monde aura un oeil sur ta fortune
T'aura plus besoin de personne pour t'avancer quoi que ce soit
Tu descends en Espagne, qué pasa?
Maintenant c'est toi qui distribues
D'autre attendent dans l'ombre patiemment que tu trébuches!

Ouais ouais, t'inquiète il peuvent toujours attendre ma chute
J'srai toujours à la hauteur de ma réput'
Je serai rusé
J’aurai confiance en personne, sauf en mes associés

Maintenant qu'c'est toi qui distribues
Les enjeux ne sont plus les mêmes, ainsi que les problèmes
Difficile de grimper sans faire du mal à personne
Sans y laisser ta personne, ça personne n'a pu le faire
Un mec refusera de te payer
Tu tiendras à ce qu'il soit le dernier à essayer
Il criera dans tout Paname qu'il t'a banane
Pour que tu récupères ta came il faut que tu le cannes
Quel culot!

J'tuerai personne pour de l'argent
C'est vrai que j'veux des tunes mais j'ai quand même une éducation (bien sûr)
J'suis pas cinglé, j'veux pas me faire épingler à vie
Mais une chose est sûre j'vais pas baltringuer!

Hey, tu penseras ne pas avoir le choix, tu l'feras
Ce que tu feras, c'est que tu l'buteras
Qu'est-ce que tu crois?
Sinon d'autres mecs viendront te racketter
Ta came, tes goves, et les loves que t'a mis de côté!
Tu tiendras trop à ta réputation d'homme d'action
Donc tu passeras à l'action ça se fera en une fraction de seconde
Mortelle sera la sanction pour ceux qui restent en vie et envient ton ascension
Ta côte va grimper, et même chez les condés
Ton dossier và changer de fichier
Fiché au grand banditisme
T'imagines bien que la fin sera triste
Tu te feras balancer, sur un coup de fil anonyme
Stoppé dans ta lancée
Sur un retour d'Espagne tu te feras levé, chargé
Le pire c'est que même tes potes vont te charger
Commission rogatoire, écoutes
T'as beau mettre toutes thunes dans le baveux, écoute!
Tu feras dix ans plein, même primaires
T'effectueras ta peine même si tu pleures des rivières!
Seule ta mère va t'assister
Après un an ou deux, tous tes potes vont se désister
Allez, peut-être qu'un seul te restera fidèle
C'est lui qui t'apprendra que ta meuf t'es infidèle
Tu vas péter les plombs, bloqué derrière les barreaux
Sortir au bout de dix ans, usé, au bout du rouleau
Avec une longue liste de comptes à régler
Mais les mecs de ton équipes se sont fait flinguer!
Ils se sont fait dépassés par des petits jeunes ambitieux
Braves comme toi à l'époque, et encore plus vicieux
Pour pouvoir te refaire
Qu'est-ce tu pourra faire?
A part monter sur un braquo, mais sa te coutera cher
Khey, parce que la prochaine fois c'est vingt ans
T'es dedans car maintenant t'a aucune qualification
T'auras palpé trop d'fric pour pouvoir accepter de bosser pour l'SMIC
Tu seras pris dans la spirale tu te rappellera mes paroles
Tu envieras ceux qui auront poursuivis l'école
Il sera trop tard, ce qui est fait est fait
Tu regretteras l'époque ou tu m'disais

Rabza ou renoi tout est fait pour nous mettre de côté
Le jeu n'est pas risqué, il est truqué
Et a 2 doigts de nos rêves on trouve un cauchemar embusqué
Ta chance tu veux la brusquer
La France nous a terrorisé, parc'que notre avenir est plastiqué

Je serai avec toi, moi contre eux
Blah sur la jalousie! Blah sur l'envie!

Des que tu sors la tête de l'eau ils veulent te noyer
Te broyer, peut-être même te nettoyer
Tu leur dois rien mais les frères veulent te faire payer
T'as beau venir de loin comme eux
Vu qu'tu t'en sors ils estiment que t'es plus comme eux
Ils veulent avoir c'que tu possèdes
Espèrent tes obsèques, belleck mec, l'envie les obsedent
Pourtant le mal ça se concurrence
Tu bicraves plus au détail alors un frère te balance
Combien de frères ont perdu leur liberté
Sur un coup de fil anonyme pour le plaisir de te voir tomber, t'imagines?
Comment veux tu qu'on soit soudés?
Que je t'aide si tu ne penses qu'à me dessouder

Moi c'est un frère que je vois quand j'te regarde
Pourquoi tu serais mon ennemi
Parce que j'ai grandi a Orly et toi a Saint Denis?
Parce que t'as pris beaucoup plus de tunes que moi?
Alors que t'a fais face aux mêmes obstacles que moi, c'est débile!
Même pauvre faut rester lucide
Tu peux souhaiter t'en sortir sans être cupide
Et si ta réussite passe par la chute des autres
Et que ta jalousie te pousse a buter les nôtres: la honte négro!
T'as du retard j'te le dis d'avance

Ok, Hey

On pleure quand il est trop tard
Et on gâche l'instant présent
On nargue le bonheur quand il se présente
Comme si on avait peur d'être heureux
On se sent seul dans la crainte d'être deux
Thug Love, on bâillonne nos sentiments
Avec les liens de la raison
On les mènes, têtes baissées vers la pendaison
Thugs, on explose de l'intérieur
Car jamais nos ""Je t'aime"" ne doivent se lire de l'extérieur
Thugs, on n'est bon qu'à faire semblant
La mort c'est trop brutal, c'est sans protection et sans gant
On est lâches, nous!
Pourquoi tu crois qu'on cache et qu'on gâche tout?
(Thugs)
Et ceux qu'on aime disparaissent
Sur nos peaux aucune trace de leurs caresses
Les souvenirs, c'est tout ce qu'il nous reste
Ils partent, nous on reste
Avec nos larmes de regrets
Avec tout ce qu'on n'a pas su dire
Tout ce qu'on n'a pas su lire
Et, tout ce qu'on leur a fait subir
Ils meurent, et on vit avec nos secrets
D'amour, et nos larmes de regrets

Même si pour toi c'est dur à dire
J'ai peur qu'il ne soit trop tard alors donnes-moi

En vain, je ne te décrypte pas, mais dis-moi pourquoi
Toi, tout ce que tu me donnes, c'est ton ""Thug Love""?
Ni moins, ni plus que ton ""Thug Love""

Ici les ""Je t'aime"" sont gelés
Le miroir des rêves s'est fêlé
Vécus de fêlés
Dans la peur d'un amour vénal
On redoute plus la trahison que le pénal
Thugs, on veut aimer sans s'abandonner
Ça ne cache rien d'autre que la crainte d'être abandonnés
(Vous êtes lâches)
Pourquoi tu crois qu'on cache et qu'on gâche tout?
Thug Love, souvent l'épilogue est cruel
L'amour s'envole, et l'harmonie devient un duel
Puis nos flammes deviennent des cendres
Et mêmes nos étés se transforment en mois de Décembre
Il me semble, que tout les disques de l'amour finissent par se rayer
Tout comme le 9' par s'enrayer
Habitués aux remords
La rue a ses raisons que le coeur ignore

Mes thugs ne veulent pas souffrir
Alors mes thugs ne veulent pas tout dire
Va-t'en, et laisse-moi avec mes secrets
D'amour, et mes larmes de regrets!

Je les entends tous ces zoulous, ils parlent de nous
Qu'est ce qu'ils en savent des braves, nous on a galéré grave
Qu'est ce qu'ils connaissent de notre histoire ?
On revient de loin, passé trouble, présent fragile, avenir incertain
Y a peut-etre pas une équipe dans le rap qui ait tant souffert
La rue on y était, on y a saigné à coeur ouvert
La preuve nos frères sont tombés, ont rejoint leurs tombes pendant que les autres ne font que rapper
Chez nous c'est l'hécatombe, alors ne venez pas tester l'authenticité de l'équipe la plus respectée
par tous les mecs de cité
Si les jeunes nous aiment c'est parce qu'on leur ressemble
Quand ils souffrent, on souffre, quand ils meurent, on meurt ensemble
Dehors tu sais, on n'a jamais été au complet, à chaud oblige, y en avait toujours un qui manquait
Tout comme le Wu-tang Clan on déchirait sur scène,
En dehors de scène on risquait des grosses peines, en attendant que notre heure vienne

JESSY incarcéré, MISTA incarcéré

c'est pas une histoire quelconque
Cette histoire c'est la nôtre, si elle ressemble à la vôtre c'est que vous etes cainfri
vous etes donc des nôtres
Hey, hey, la Mafia k1 Fry c'était un projet, un état d'esprit, un mode de vie et de survie
Avec les plus visionnaires on voyait loin, le reve était africain, les moyens américains
Le premier mot d'ordre pour nous était : SOLIDARITE
Cela s'est avéré nécessaire pour survivre en cité, en quete du respect c'est tous contre un
Nous c'était si, si tu en tues un ils en reste plein du moins
c'est ce qu'on croyait avant que la roue nous broie
Y a qu'au pied du mur que tu vois si t'es aussi fort que tu crois
Mafia k1 Fry thug life, Orly Choisy Vitry thug life
On revait que chaque jeune en téci puisse lever la tete et dire je suis mafia k1 Fry
Et sache qu'il y a des mecs en cavale ou à l'ombre
qui sont plus mafia k1 Fry que tous les membres du groupe
T'es fou toi ! Tu crois qu'on joue toi ? Tu crois que la k1 Fry mafia ne faisait que du pe-ra ?
La demi-lune était une plaque tournante, les mecs venaient de partout pour pécho de la skunk
Qui n'a pas dealé dans l'équipe à part les bagarreurs, agresseurs et les braqueurs de banque
K1 Fry, débrouillard mais pas voyou, mais dis-toi que les voyous étaient avec et parmi nous
Certains ont choisi le rap, d'autres se sont lancé dans le milieu thug life
Et ils on payé le prix cher thug life j'ai toujours de l'amour
pour eux thug life meurtris dans leur chair thug life

Alors ouais on s'est blessé, on s'est fait du mal puisque aucun de nous n'est parfait
Tout le monde peut reprocher quelque chose à tout le monde
Peut-etre que tout le monde doit quelque chose a tout le monde
C'est comme ca dans une famille, la haine est une pauvreté que l'indulgence habille,
On s'aime donc on se pardonne tant qu'il n'y a pas trahison qui entraine mort d'homme thug life
Que serais-je sans CORONA ?
Que serais-je CORONA sans MISTA ?
Que serait MISTA sans la MAFIA ?
Mais que serait la mafia sans MANU KEY ?
Que serait RIM'K sans AP ?
Que serait le 113 sans MOKOBE ?
Que serait SELIM sans JESSY MONEY ?
Que serait Hakim sans le D ?
Que serait street lourd sans MOSKO ?
Ce babtou généreux et réglo, ghetto solidaire de ses rabza et de ses négros
Gros la Mafia k1 Fry ce n'est pas une couleur, c'est un espoir et une douleur
Parmi nous y'a de tout, gars, et ca fait bien longtemps qu'on est tous passés au-dessus de ca
Unis par la misère, Foulek, Loco. Mais que serais Idéal J sans Rocco ?
À nous tous plus d'un million d'albums vendus, qui l'aurait cru ?
Populaire mais jamais vendu
Qui aurait pu penser que le R.A.P. pourrait donner une chance aux ghettos francais
Mais t'emballe pas, on ne s'en est pas encore sorti
Vise si certains font des hits, d'autres font encore des litres
Notre histoire a une beauté, de toute sa cruauté elle est unique, n'essaie jamais de nous l'ôter
Que serait la demi-lune sans Karlito et sa plume, qui pleure des poésies et d'amertume ?
Sans ROH2F qu'aurait été ma jeunesse ?
I love you my men, got bless you
Thug life que chacun d'entre nous reconnaisse avec humilité tout ce qu'il doit à L.A.S
La Mafia k1 Fry c'est sa mort, sa vie. Jusqu'à la mort parce qu'on croit à la vie, OJ thug life

À travers la voix d'OGB, n'entends-tu pas la deuxième France dire ?
Je suis mafia k1 fry thug life
Mafia k1 Fry thug life
C'est pas du rap mais de la survie. Thug life
On n'a pas choisi, thug life c'est la vie qu'on a mené, pardon à tous ceux qu'on a blessés
On n'a pas choisi, Orly Vitry Choisy, on a le coeur en cendres, on a le passé en sang
OK, on a grandi ensemble, Orly Choisy Vitry, 113 clan, l'union, demi-lune zoo

Kery James,"T'es incarcéré mais un beau jour tu vas sortir
Te réinsérer et en fin de compte fonder un empire
Les regards accusateurs, tu t'en fous tu les feras mentir
T’as le droit de devenir meilleur toi qu'a toujours connu le pire
L'espoir brille à l'horizon, laisse ses rayons t'éblouir
Quelque soient tes lésions, tu finiras par guérir
Tes rêves peuvent encore courir même en fauteuil roulant,
L'espoir c'est comme un sourire dans ton cœur il prend son élan,
Tu peux encore construire même sur des ruines,
Tout recommencer, partir et changer de vie
Changer de vie, changer de ville, changer d’île, changer de vision
Savoir ce que c'est d'être libre, en t'évadant de ta propre prison
Le bonheur à l'horizon, faut juste pas être peureux
On se fait facilement des raisons pour ne pas être heureux
On s'invente des arguments pour ne pas être deux
Quoique cache l'horizon, ça vaut le coup d'être curieux

La victoire scintille à l'horizon
Même si on perd nos poètes
Ton histoire élèvera ton nom
Parti de peu rien ne t'arrête
Je te retrouverai,
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Je te retrouverai
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Sur le chemin de notre liberté

Il ou elle est parti, c'est peut-être que tout vous sépare
Tu retrouveras l'harmonie dans un autre regard
Tu te laisseras submerger par un amour torrentiel
Pour un feu allumé, il suffit parfois d'une étincelle
Un œil sur ton gamin, même si t'es seul à l'élever
T'en feras quelqu'un de bien, meilleur que tu ne l'as été
Même si t'as le cœur lourd, rêver ça rend léger
L'hiver finit toujours par se faire chasser par l'été
Gardez vos déceptions, rendez-nous nos espoirs
Ne parlez pas d'abandon, rendez-nous nos victoires
Ne séchez pas nos larmes non, rendez-nous nos sourires
Le bonheur à l'horizon, laissez nous partir!

La victoire scintille à l'horizon
Même si on perd nos poètes
Ton histoire élèvera ton nom
Parti de peu rien ne t'arrête
Je te retrouverai,
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Je te retrouverai
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Sur le chemin de notre liberté

Notre passé
Notre geôlier
Notre honte
Notre prison
Notre mémoire
Est sans pitié
Moitié plaie
Moitié guérison
A cette illusion
Qu'est la fatalité
Tu sauras dire non
Pour te réinventer
Toi et le passé
Dure amitié
Mais la honte d'amour peut s'effacer

La victoire scintille à l'horizon
Même si on perd nos poètes
Ton histoire élèvera ton nom
Parti de peu rien ne t'arrête
Je te retrouverai,
Sur le chemin de notre liberté
Je te retrouverai

Kery James,"Allô Tef', bien ou quoi?
Bien, tranquille.
J'étais en train de me dire,
Ça serait peut-être mortel qu'on invite Youssoupha sur l'album, non?
Oh la la laisse tomber, c'est pas une bonne idée
Il a pris trop de place depuis que t'es parti poto.
Ah ouais tu crois?
Il est gentil mais je le sens un peu dans une compétition, bizarre avec toi
Ouais j'ai remarqué moi aussi
On dirait qu'il veut te remplacer
Ouais c'est vrai que les gens ils disent ça mais
Y'a pas de mais, gros, les gens en plus,
Il arrêtent pas de vous comparer, tout le temps, tout le temps

Me comparer à Youssoupha? T'es fou, je vois pas le rapport
Le négro est trop bas, d'où je suis je vois pas le rappeur
Pour que le négro arrive, il a fallu que je m'absente
Comme Jay-Z sans Biggie, Bonobo a saisi la branche
Il ne sera jamais personne, car il tente de plaire à tout le monde
Moi ce n'est pas un zeuveu mais une épée sur la langue
À Quoi ça sert d'être en indé' pour faire de la soupe radiophonique?
Lui c'est ""On se connaît"", moi c'est ""Lettre à la République""
Qui prétend faire du R.A.P. Sans se positionner?
Si t'écoutes Youssou-Falche, t'as jamais entendu de rap français
Tu veux faire du KJ avec le flow de Mélanie
Normal que tu sois banni du remix de ""Dernier MC""
Je suis revenu tu dois partir, eh, c'est l'effet papillon
T'aurais dû me sampler pour faire les disques de ton daron
T'es trop peace, trop lisse, trop transparent
Faudrait t'ouvrir le crâne pour savoir ce que tu penses vraiment
On te cajole chez Ruquier, on me piège chez Ardisson
Quelle place t'as sur l’échiquier? Eh, pose-toi la question!
Arrête d’exhiber ton bac, et de jouer au singe savant
Depuis ton arrivée, ils disent que le rap était mieux avant
Négro fuis, tu fais du rap tah les Beaux-Arts
Tu fais du rap tah les clochards
J'ai tellement de classiques, appelle-moi ""Mozart""
Où sont les tiens? Nulle part

Y'a des rumeurs entre nous, y'a des rancœurs entre nous
Des engreneurs, des pompeurs, des rappeurs entre nous
Y'a les majors entre nous, le Top-IFOP entre nous
Les internautes, la radio, la parano entre nous
Eh, et je pourrais te tuer dans cette épreuve
Pour le fric, pour les clics, pour le buzz
Y'a Médine entre nous, y'a ce titre entre nous
Avant c'était eux contre nous, maintenant c'est nous contre nous
Kery

Allô Youss', eh ouais c'est Sam's.
Et wesh c'est quoi son délire à Kery, là?
Eh le mec ça fait vingt piges il est là,
Il commence à plus avoir de force,
Il sent que tu lui prends sa place, ça y est il pète les plombs!
Et moi je t'avais dit y'a plus de petits, y'a plus de grands,
Il fait le mec pacifiste tout ça, il est plein de bagarres.
Eh t'en as rien à foutre frère, allume-le!

Kery James t'es devenu fade
J'aime pas ton rap, je simule
Donc fallait bien que je te remplace pour que le combat continue
Tu te dissimules, parle de Din afin de laver ton image
À Un moment, il faut choisir,
Soit t'es rappeur, soit t'es imam
T'es mal, surtout que t'es pas irréprochable selon les dires
S'il faut du rap qui parle de Din,
Moi je préfère écouter Médine, que dis-je?
Tu demandes aux jeunes d'entreprendre, mais je te rappelle
Que chez nous,
On attend toujours le nom de ton propre label *C'est ça même*
L'instru est cain-ri et tu prends le microphone
T'avais promis de pas revenir,
Donc retourne rapper sur tes xylophones
Et Tefa pourra te dire si ton skeud' pète
Que t'as attendu ""Noir Désir"" pour rapper sur du dubstep
Vingt ans de carrière, je dis pas mieux, mais non merci
Je réalise comment t'es vieux, t'as dû rapper avec Soon E MC
Je te remercie, à cause de toi, je rappe sale
Mais bon, je rappe tellement bien qu'on dit que tu rappes, mal
Normal, dans ma folie t'aimes peut-être pas mes commentaires
T'es peut-être de Orly, mais moi Kinshasa c'est ma terre
T'as peut-être des classiques, mais moi j'ai des tubes qui t'enterrent
T'as peut-être la Mafia K'1 Fry, mais moi j'ai toute l'Afrique entière
Ces derniers temps, tu t'es fais rare, damn!
T'étais à l'ombre du show-business, alors je t'ai mis à l'ombre du rap game
Je suis disque de platine,
Pop-pop-pop c'est pas le retour du rap français
Mon rap français n'est jamais parti

Y'a des rumeurs entre nous, y'a des rancœurs entre nous
Des engraineurs, des pompeurs, des rappeurs entre nous
Y'a les majors entre nous, le Top-IFOP entre vous
Les internautes, la radio, la parano entre nous
Eh, et je pourrais te tuer dans cette épreuve
Pour le fric, pour les clics, pour le buzz
Y'a Médine entre nous, y'a ce titre entre nous
C'était eux contre nous maintenant c'est nous contre nous

Kery tu parles comme un jeune rookie qu'a faim d'buzz
Depuis quand tu clashes pour élargir ta fan base?
Tu nous fais le remake des Beatles et des Stones
Et si tu te prends pour Eminem, on va finir par tous devenir Stan
Youss' tu paranoïes, James toujours te paraphrase
Gros tu pars à l'Ouest quand tu prends pour clash un parrainage
T'as le vent en poupe et le succès te ventouse
Mais garde en tête que si la girouette bouge, c'est que le vent tourne
A.L.I.X. Des deux mains je t'applaudis
Tu n'as pas honte d'écrire comme dans les pages d'un tabloïd?
Je peux plus croire que ""Constat amer"" sort de ta plume
N'es-tu qu'un slogan marketing hors de sa pub?
Mc parolier de Kinshasa
Quand tu rappes, c'est la voix de Kery James qu'identifie Shazam
Tu n'es qu'héritier, pas de ton père mais de Kery J
Et si ça continue comme ça, mon frère, tu ne seras que R.I.P
Ideal Juice versus Youssouph'
Allez être milliardaire sous terre en vue Youtube
Observez que vous ne servez que de bons clowns
Comme Véronique insultant la foi de Mouss Diouf
Auditeur qui de ce siècle aide les sponsors
Faites en sorte que les corbillards restent au point-mort
Parfois ça mène au clic-clic que de cliquer
Face au gling gling du bling bling, on vient se liguer!

Des engreneurs, des pompeurs, des rappeurs entre vous
Y'a les majors entre vous, le Top-IFOP entre vous

Kery James,"Kery James est de retour, pose le micro t'es fou
Et si tu veux me faire taire, pose de la nitro, c'est tout
Tu peux assassiner l'homme, mes écrits te survivront
Mais on ne tire pas au gomme-cogne sur le dernier MC vivant
Pop-pop c'est le retour du rap français
Qui fait bouger les cœurs et les têtes avant les fessiers
1 pour l'éducation car sans elle pas d'élévation, encore moins de révolution
Qui prétend faire du rap sans prendre position?

Eh! Ça n'a pas de sens je suis venu en secouriste
Réanimer les consciences que les faux MCs abrutissent
Trop grande est notre influence dans les quartiers à hauts risques
À part compter leur redevance, à quoi leur rimes aboutissent?
Tu sais ce que je pense des pseudos-gangsters
En quête d'une seule réponse, qui sera le plus riche du cimetière?
Tu retardes pas le temps avec ta Rolex, MC
T'es quand même mort enfermé dans un cercueil Gucci

Eh! La rue me soutient, la rue se souvient
Depuis ""La Vie est brutale"", elle sait que je suis sur une mission
Je n'ai jamais baissé mon futal au détriment de mes ambitions
Et même quand j'étais plongé, dans un nuage de fumée
J'avais déjà mal au cœur en chantant le Ghetto Français
J'étais bloqué dans l'Impasse sur une voix à Deux Issues
Tant que les miens ne seront pas en place, pour moi le combat continue
Banlieusard et fier de l'être, eh! Tu sais que je représente
Ma Vérité contre un chèque? Quoi, crois-tu que je plaisante?
Thug Life, Hardcore jusqu'à la mort
Génération sacrifiée demande à mon frère des Comores
Vingt ans de carrière, vingt ans de classiques, titillée
Ils se demandent comment faire taire le plus africain des An-ti-tillais
Tout le monde ne peut pas le faire et rester-ter-ter entier
Fais-fais un pas en arrière, ou tire au canon sci-scié
Rappelle toi qu'en 2006, personne ne voulait me si-signer
Que disait-on dans les maisons de disque? ""Kery James c'est-c'est terminé""
Mais eux se sont faits-faits virer, quant à moi, j'ai pas fini
Et si le public me suit, 2013 je serai à Bercy

Pour devenir un MC suffit pas d'en avoir l'ambition
Ou de marcher sur les autres pour s'emparer de la pôle position
Le truc tourne vite en rond quand t'as que la haine comme inspiration
À quoi bon faire des menaces si tu rappes des dépositions?
Frangin, y'aura pas de refrain et y'en aura pour tout le monde
Les prédateurs ont faim mais je suis un agneau qui sait se défendre
Le brutal peut être la fin, je sais que je risque de me faire descendre
Et que ça peut sentir le sapin bien avant le mois de décembre
Mais on ne peut pas plaire à tout le monde
Sauf en étant hypocrite
Y'en a qu'ont toujours pas digéré ma lettre à la République
C'est la vérité qu'ils refusent car cette lettre n'est qu'un miroir
Le jour où je présente mes excuses, c'est que je fais de l'humour noir

Tant mieux si ça les gêne, que les miens s'y sont reconnus
Et pour appuyer le système, t'auras toujours deux-trois vendus
T'auras toujours des traîtres et des négresses de maison
Qui pour quelques privilèges t'expliqueront que le maître est bon
T'auras toujours des envieux qui pour se démarquer
Se positionneront contre en espérant se faire remarquer
Observe leur arrogance et devine leur soif de pouvoir
Moi j'entends leur ignorance même quand ils étalent leur savoir
Les Noirs sont affaiblis, oui, parce qu'ils sont désunis
Le premier ""J"" qui nous ronge, c’est le ""J"" de la jalousie
Mais tu manques d'humilité pour remettre en question tes méthodes
Pour toi la révolution ne peut avoir lieu que sous tes ordres
Mais j'ai déjà un prophète, je n'ai pas besoin de gourou
On n'a pas le même combat, on ne frappe pas avec les mêmes coups
Tu es manipulé, tu brises l'unité
C'est par des nègres comme toi que Malcom X fut assassiné

Il y aura toujours des ignorants, des lâches et des racistes
Des skins aux cheveux longs sous l'étiquette nationaliste
Entre la haine des autres et la fierté de soi il y a qu'un pas
Entre ma joue gauche et ma joue droite il y a mon bras
Il ne peuvent qu'agiter le leurre du racisme anti-blanc
Comme quoi il n'y a pas de couleur pour brandir de faux arguments
Alors je rappe
1 Pour mes babtous, car on a besoin d'unité
Pour faire face au système qui veut diviser pour mieux régner
J'ai brisé mes chaînes et je ne cherche pas à être assisté
Je ne fais qu'évoquer l'histoire mais je ne vis pas dans le passé
En parlant de passé, puisque les colonies c'est fini
Expliquez-moi ce que les soldats français faisaient en Libye

Vous apportiez la Démocratie
C'est ce que croient les incultes que vos médias ont abrutis
Qui?
Qui travaille pour qui? Qui domine?
Qui est Bernard-Henry Lévy, qui le nomine?

Qui répand toutes ces salades?
Qui veut faire de Damas le nouveau Bagdad?
Qui détruit les tombes des Saints sur le sol libyen?
Qui prend en otage le peuple malien?
Qui sont ces mercenaires?
Qui les finance?
Qui profite de ces guerres?
Quelles sont leurs conséquences?
Qui distribue les rôles? Qui décide?
Pourquoi l'OTAN ne se déplace que pour certains génocides?
Que se passe-t-il en Birmanie?
Pourquoi les médias font un déni?
Qui veut enflammer le Monde Musulman?
Qui veut répandre le sang par la provocation?
Qui manipule les masses, qui déstabilise?
Qui brandit le voile islamique pour cacher la crise?
L'heure est grave (grave)
Le Monde a pris un tournant, les vrais le savent (savent)
Pour le reste du troupeau brutal sera le réveil
La France est mieux sans Nico, mais au final ça sera pareil
Te fais pas d'illusion va falloir passer à la caisse
Tu vas t'endormir en France et te réveiller en Grèce

Pourtant j'y ai tant puisé
D'amor j'ai tant abusé, et je ne sais que m'excuser
Elle m'aime à me pardonner
Elle fait parti de ces femmes qu'ignorent le verbe ""abandonner""
Deviens comme elle, prends la pour modèle
Tu seras une princesse avant d'être une reine
Si un jour je dois m'en aller
Je te laisse entre de bonnes mains
J'ai le cœur tranquillisé
Ta mère je l'aime sans comédie
Love Music, je n'ai qu'une seule mélodie

Love Music
Je n'ai plus envie de cacher l'amour qui m'habite
Je t'ai dans le sang je t'aime en hémorragie
Il est grand temps que j'écrive aux femmes de ma vie
Love Music
Contre vents et marée mon amour t'abrites
Je t'ai dans le sang je t'aimes en hémorragie
Il est temps que je rende hommage aux femmes de ma vie

Tu sais moi, j'ai du faire sans mon père
Comme le re-fré Tunisiano, sans repères
Il a fait ce qu'il pouvait, je lui en veux pas car certes,
C'est de lui dont j'ai hérité, l'amour des lettres
Derrière chaque homme y'a une mère
La mienne mérite que j'invoque pour elle à chacune de mes prières
Depuis ta naissance je réalise mieux
A quel point son courage est majestueux
Elle m'a aimé à s'en priver
Je voudrais décrire son sacrifice mais je trouve pas les mots pour dire vrai
A vrai dire, toi aussi tu lui dois beaucoup car sans elle,
Peut-être que ton père ne serais qu'un vulgaire voyou
Tu sais, j'ai failli mal tourné
Là où on attend le temps, j'ai failli séjourné
Entre les G.A.V. Et les perquisitions
J'ai fait peur à ta grand mère puis je lui ai demandé pardon
Elle m'a aimé à me pardonner
Elle fait parti de ces femmes qui ignorent le verbe ""abandonner""
Je viens de la rue moi, j'ai toujours fais de la Thugs Music
Qui aurait cru qu'un jour je ferais de la Love Music

Je n'ai plus envie de cacher l'amour qui m'habite
Je t'ai dans le sang je t'aime en hémorragie

Kery James,"Derrière chaque homme y'a une femme
Tout comme derrière chaque ""je t'aime"" devrait y avoir une flamme
Nos villes sont pleines de reines sans roi
À qui on fait subir des peines sans droit
On ne sait vivre avec, mais peux-tu vivre sans elle?
Sombre comme une rose sans couleur ou un oiseau sans ailes
On y comprend rien, même en changeant d'angle de vue
Le mystère féminin serait-il notre mystère le plus connu?
Il est facile de séduire et de rendre une femme amoureuse
Mais comment se conduire quand tu veux rendre une femme heureuse?
Des mots sans pensée, et des rancunes inavouées
La femme a ses raisons du cœur qu'on ne saisit jamais

You will never know
I will never show
What I feel
What I need from you, no!
You will never know
I will never show
What I feel
What I need from you

On leur donne si peu mais on attend tout d'elles
Alors notre vie à deux aboutit souvent à un duel
On rêve de ne faire qu'un, mais la question c'est ""Lequel?""
Depuis quand l'égoïsme peut se conjuguer au pluriel?
La femme est surprenante, même son silence est un cri
En plus de l'écouter on devrait deviner ses non-dits
Doucement nous séparer comme les sentiments et l'esprit
Et au fond nous somme liés, je dirai comme le jour et la nuit
Nous sommes condamnés à accepter les compromis
Même si c'est se contenter de la moitié de se qu'on s'est promis
Loin de l'insouscience et de l'ignorance des premiers jours
Sur les routes de la différence on peut encore croiser l'amour

You will never know
I will never show
What I feel
What I need from you, no!
You will never know
I will never show
What I feel
What I need from you

No, no, no no, no no, you'll never know, know
No, no, no no, no no, you'll never know, know
No, no, no no, no no, you'll never know, know
No, no, no no, no no, you'll never know, know

Love me, love me, love me, no

Je chanterai toujours la rue, car je viens du Demi-Lune Zoo
Là où j'ai vécu, tu parles mal, tu prends des coups
La rue et moi on est lié, je te demande pas ton avis
Même si je suis pas tatoué, je suis marqué à vie
Intérieures sont les lésions, 94 la légion
Qu'importe ta région, la rue à ses 4 saisons
On parle toujours des mêmes faits, on les appelle ""divers""
Toutes les histoires de gangster, commencent un hiver
Tes poches sont trouées, tu vis la misère pleinement
T'as beau être vivant, tu tires une tête d'enterrement
T'observes les autres briller, tu veux en être
Tu veux faire des billets et vivre en maître
Pour toi la liberté c'est travailler pour personne
Consommer sans compter, jusqu'à ce qu'une balle de perfore
Dans ta tête c'est l'hiver, le temps est gris
Tes espoirs glissent sur des bouts de verres, t'es déjà aigris
Difficile de rester stable, quand on a grandi sur du verglas
T'as posé le cartable, tu comptes faire des dégâts
Tu galères, tu gèles, tes espoirs sont enrhumés
T'attends plus le père Noël, t'as jamais eu de cheminé
Tu veux prendre des thunes avant de faire de l'arthrose
Avant de vendre de la coke, t'avais jamais vu de billets mauves

Comparable à un arbre, ton business commence à fleurir
Plus tes concurrents versent de larmes, plus tu retrouves le sourire
T'attends plus que la roue tourne, tu la renverses
Recevoir quelques coups, cette saison comme les averses
Tu craints plus les intempéries, t'es mouillé jusqu'au coup
Qui met ton business en péril, tu l’amèneras jusqu'au trou
T'es plus redoutable, parce que tu vas jusqu'au bout
Tous paraissent raisonnables devant toi, tellement t'es fou
T'es de la mauvaise graine, que t'arrêtes pas de semer
Ton armée c'est la haine, tu grimpes vers les sommets
De là haut tu te souviens de l'hiver, comme un mauvais souvenir
Maintenant tu fais des affaires, commence à t'enrichir
Depuis que tu fais du fric, toutes les filles te trouvent mignon
Avec les premiers rayons de ton soleil, ton premier million
La vie tu la trouves belle comme ça
Si elle te plaît tu l'amènes à Marbella
Tu rebicraves le Clio, optes pour le Audi
Petit pavillon au michto, tu sors le daron du taudis
Tu le laisses vivre de ses illusions, il croit que tu taffes
Quand il pose des questions, tu lui brandis de faux FAF
Tu mènes une double vie, tu vis dans le mensonge
Ton appétit grandit, autant que tu manges

Tes associés commencent à tomber comme des feuilles
C'est l'automne lors des additions et des deuils
T'es parano tu te sens de plus en plus seul
Ceux qui t'entourent sont sûrement ceux qui t'en veulent
Tu roules en voiture volé calibré et prêt à allumer
T'as plus confiance en personne depuis que tu as failli te faire fumer
Tu portes le gilet, mais t'as le cœur criblé
Tu vois ta vie dans un viseur, tu te sens ciblé
Tu t'es fais balancer, tu perds de grosses sommes
La cavale faut la financer, c'est pas la grosse forme
Depuis que c'est vraiment chaud, plus personne ne prend tes patins
Quand il s'agit de sauver sa peau, il faut un frère pas un copain
L'été est lointain, s'évanouit comme un soupir
Maintenant que l'hivers revient, c'est lui qui te semble un souvenir
A chaque ""on-dit"" dans la cité, t'es plus ce que tu étais
T'as meuf t'as quitté, elle préfère l'été
Tu fais plus rentrer un rond, depuis que tu tournes en promenade
Tu tournes en rond, t'es trop mat'
Tu veux tellement sortir, que le baveux te fais cracher
Crapuleux il te soutire tes dernières thunes que t'as caché

A défaut d'avoir des causes, ils cherchent des prétextes

Ils ont la haine, comme si je leur devait quelque chose
Ils surprennent comme des ordis cachés dans un bouquet de rose
On dirait que je suis un aimant, tellement ces mecs sont collants
Je pourrai le faire rapidement, tellement que ces mecs sont trop lents
Je les entend parler, mais je n'écoute pas ce qu'ils disent
Je n'ai pas besoin de suivre leurs regards, pour savoir ce qu'ils visent
Ces jaloux veulent ma place, le constat est amer
Ils préparent des coups de crasse, et osent m'appeler mon frère
J'ai mal à la colonne tellement c'est bas
Ils font des monologues et appellent ça des débats
Je n'ai pas survécu au 94 pour finir à genoux
Contrairement aux sacs de frappes, moi je rends les coups
En tant que mec de tess ils en peuvent pas m'impressionner

Je peux devenir ghetto, brutal je doit le reconnaître

J'essaye d'y arriver, sans me faire menotter
Sans me déshabiller, et sans me faire carroter
Demande à mes frères, je les ai tous fais croquer

Kery James,"Nos amours éclatent en plein vol, il ne reste que des débris
On se rencontre au soleil, mais on se quitte sous la pluie
On tombe amoureux en silence, on se sépare dans le bruit
Nos promesses boivent la tasse, asphyxiées au fond d'un puits
Notre histoire part en lambeaux, la haine reprend le flambeau
Dans le tourment et le chaos, on s'dit au revoir devant les tribuneaux
On s'était promis d'affronter la vie comme un seul être
Des années de vie commune pour finir par ne pas s'reconnaitre
Le temps dévoile nos défauts, flingue nos romances
Souvent nos désirs s'essoufflent quand nos habitudes commencent
Arrive l'hiver des épreuves, gèle les beaux discours
Nos rancunes nous aveuglent, dans un dialogue de sourd
Les ""je t'aime"" à la pelle sur les rivages
Peu à peu nos différences deviennent des clivages
On a plus rien d'un couple, on en a que l'image
Et y'a cet enfant entre nous, de pris en otage

Mon avenir s'écrit dans le sable
Je suis la fin du livre, la dernière page
Des morceaux de nous, des morceaux de nous
Des morceaux de nous, ooooh
Ce qui est cassé se répare
Pourquoi le passé nous sépare?
Des morceaux de nous, des morceaux de nous
Des morceaux de nous, ooooh

J'ai grandi sans mon père, ça m'a laissé un vide affectif
Ça a fait de moi un enfant, à la fois solide et chétif
J'ai mis du temps à guérir, j'ai mis du temps à aimer
J'ai mis du temps à m'ouvrir, par crainte d'être abandonné
Par crainte d'abandonner, reproduire les schémas
Effrayé par l'idée que mes enfants héritent de mes traumas
Il a fallu que je tempère pour soigner mes déchirures
Annihiler cette colère, qui parfois nous défigure
J'pense à ces hommes qui voient grandir leurs enfants loin d'eux
À qui le tribunal ordonne d'aimer un week-end sur deux
Ou qui doivent rester proches en étant distants
Pourtant on est jamais parents à mi-temps
Les ""je t'aime"" à la pelle sur les rivages
Peu à peu nos différences deviennent des clivages
On a plus rien d'un couple, on en a que l'image

Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Le temps, toujours le temps
Saisi l’instant, vis le moment
Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Doucement, prends toujours le temps

On a beau être pressés, les aiguilles nous font plier
On arrête pas le temps en renversant le sablier
On parle de nous au passé le jour où l'horloge s'effondre
Chaque vie passée est un assemblage de secondes
Nos sourires prennent des rides, nos souvenirs la poussière
Le temps n’est jamais rigide, aujourd'hui deviendra hier
À force de s’précipiter, on fait les choses à moitié
Ma vie : une construction qui semble tous les jours en chantier
Loin de ma famille, j'écris c'texte au studio
Mes pensées s'éparpillent, j’vois grandir mes gosses en photo
J’ai temps de projets en attente, mais ma mort est latente
J’ai peur de m’en aller sans avoir profité d’leur présence
J’ai besoin de prendre le temps, d’avancer en m’arrêtant
Respirer, laisser le temps à l’amour de m'inspirer

Prends le temps, vis-le
Deviens le temps, pleinement
Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Le temps, toujours le temps
Saisi l’instant, vis le moment
Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Doucement, prends toujours le temps

On a des portables et des mails, tout pour gagner du temps
Mais même écrire un texto nous paraît éreintant
Depuis les réseaux sociaux, on est encore plus distants
On a beau avoir Facebook, on est pas moins seuls pour autant
""Lol"" remplace un sourire, ""Mdr"" un fou rire, pourtant
On a tout pour être ensemble mais on n’s'aime qu'à mi-temps
J'pense aux frères incarcérés qui comptent le temps
Et savent combien il est important
Le temps ce n'est pas de l'argent mais de l'or
L'aboutissement de tous nos instants c'est la mort
Mieux vaut être constant que d'aller trop vite
N'a pas profité de l'instant, qui se précipite
Un ciel étoilé, un coucher de soleil
Prends le temps de contempler avant ton dernier sommeil
Ne cours plus, pose toi
Vois-tu, pour aimer à trois on attend neuf mois

Prends le temps, vis-le
Deviens le temps, pleinement
Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Le temps, toujours le temps
Saisi l’instant, vis le moment
Ni trop vite, ni trop lent
Doucement, prends toujours le temps

J'me retrouve tout seul et je ne sais plus comment
Du temps pour les autres, j'en avais jamais avant
Parfois j'me demande ce que j'ai fait de mon passé
J'ai perdu du temps à vouloir trop en gagner

J'me retrouve tout seul et je ne sais plus comment
Du temps pour les autres, j'en avais jamais avant
Parfois j'me demande ce que j'ai fait de mon passé
J'ai perdu du temps, du temps, du temps
J'ai perdu du temps, du temps, du temps
J'ai perdu du temps, du temps, du temps
J'ai perdu du temps, du temps, du temps
J'ai perdu du temps, du temps

Kery James,"Vous en avez assez, hein?
Vous en avez assez d'cette bande de racailles
On va vous en débarrasser

Racailles!
On devrait vous nettoyer au Kärcher
Le jour où le peuple se réveille vous allez prendre cher
Racailles!
On a le sentiment qu'aller voter
C'est choisir par lequel d'entre vous on veut se faire entuber
Racailles!
Républicains ou PS
Rangez vos promesses dans vos sacs Hermès
Racailles!
Vous n'avez jamais connu la précarité
Vous vivez à l'écart de nos réalités
Racailles!
La rue le pense, j'le mets en musique
Et pour ceux qui l'ignore encore j'le rends public
Je n'soutiens aucun parti, j'marche plus dans vos combines
Vos programmes électoraux ne sont que des comptines
Racailles!
On prend les mêmes et on recommence
Les mêmes promesses, les mêmes mensonges
Les mêmes tapent dans la caisses, les mêmes plongent
Les mêmes sont dans la hess, les mêmes mangent
Racailles!
Les mêmes menteurs trafiquent les mêmes comptes
Les mêmes commis au service des mêmes pontes
Les mêmes fils de pauvres sont incarcérés
Les mêmes fils de riches sont formés pour règner
En attendant qu'un homme du peuple émerge
C'est rare de trouver un élu avec un casier vierge
Ma haine du système est toujours intacte
Lequel d'entre eux peut jeter la pierre à Cahuzac?
Racailles!
Claude Guéant, Racailles! Balkany, Racailles! Jean-François Copé, Racailles!
Philippe Bernard, Racailles! Harlem Désir, Racailles! Alain Juppé, Racailles!
Tous ceux que j'ai cité ont été condamnés
Ce sont les mecs de cités qu'ils traitent comme des damnés
Racailles!
Vous étiez choqués par le groupe Tandem
Vous faites la même à la France, mais jusqu'à ce qu'elle saigne
Jusqu'à ce qu'elle coule comme la Grèce ou l'Italie
Vous avez meurtri le pays jusqu'à l'agonie
Racailles!
Cumul des mandats jusqu'où vous irez?
Est-ce le cumul des salaires que vous désirez?
Racailles!
Comme toute la France d'en bas j'crois plus aux politiciens
J'continue le combat, j'crois au réveil citoyen
Racailles!
Pour changer les choses il faut le vouloir
Vous n'avez pas de cause profonde si ce n'est le pouvoir
Racailles!
Vous faites de la politique sans conviction
Parfois vous en faites même pour éviter la prison
Racailles!
En costume-cravate sont les vrais voyous
Vous ne croyez plus en rien, plus personne croit en vous
Racailles!
Y'a qu'à observer les taux d'abstention
Faut pas trop prendre les gens pour des cons, attention
Racailles!
Sentez-vous le vent tourner comme vos vestes?
Entre vous et la rue, y'a plus que les CRS
Racailles!
A bout de souffle, votre système est dans un cul de sac
A essayer de se débattre, comme un cul d'jatte
Racailles!
Vous êtes élus pour un truc
Vous ne le faites pas plus
Vous faites l'inverse, en plus
Ça ne vous gêne pas
Racailles!
Et si le peuple a l'idée de se rebeller
Vous disposez d'une armée de flics bien dressés et zélés
Racailles!
Le dialogue social gît dans un cercueil
Les keufs tirent aux flashballs, tu peux y perdre un œil
Racailles!
Vous faites monter le sentiment anti-policier
Usez de la police comme d'une armée privatisée

Le politique, qu'il soit femme ou homme, pour moi, en tous les cas et pour l'instant
peut-être que demain j'aurais changé d'avis
il sert plus à rien, c'est un prestataire de service
Ces putains de dettes, là qui emmerdent tout le monde
qui mettent les peuples à plat, qui les mettent à genoux et ainsi de suite
on n'arrive pas à les éliminer, comme vous les politiques
vous arrivez pas à les faire éliminer, ces putains de dettes
Parce que la banque elle est plus forte que vous!

Racailles!
Tout le monde le sait c'est une évidence
Vous êtes complètement soumis à la finance
Racailles!
Vous votez les lois que les riches ordonnent
Après le 49.3 plus rien ne m'étonne
Racailles!
On travaille plus mais on gagne moins
On attend juste le printemps européen
On cotise pour des retraites qu'on ne verra peut-être jamais
Tout l'argent qu'on fait rentrer vous nous le reprenez
Racailles!
Chaque fin de mois à découvert
On a l'impression d'être esclave du système bancaire
Racailles!
Même les riches connaissent le jeu, jouissent des niches fiscales
Les petites PME croulent sous les charges sociales
Racailles!
Radar, on paye!
Péage, on paye!
Pollution, on paye!
Racailles!
Oh! Qu'est-ce que vous faites avec tout ce fric?
Que foutait Eric Zemmour sur une chaîne publique?
Racailles!
Payer pour propager sa haine
Semer des graines récoltées par le FN
Pour vous même Marine Le Pen est devenue fréquentable
Quiconque combat l'Islam peut s'asseoir à votre table
Racailles!
Incapables de gouverner vous divisez
Racailles!
Incapables de rassembler vous stigmatisez
Racailles!
Aveuglés par le pouvoir vos cœurs sont voilés
Beaucoup plus que le visage de cette femme voilée
Racailles!
Tout vos prétendus principes de laïcité
Ne concernent pas cette saoudienne sur les Champs Elysées
Pour vous tout se négocie, tout est question de gent-ar
Vous êtes même prêts à livrer les banlieues au Qatar
Racailles!
Votre jeu est trouble
Racailles!
Votre discours est double
Racailles!
Au pays dit des droits de l'Homme
Racailles!
L'Etat d'urgence est devenu la norme
Et vous prétendez faire la leçon au monde entier
Imposer la démocratie à coups de mortier
Sans pitié vous avez buté Kadhafi
Aujourd'hui dans quel état se retrouve la Libye?
La rue le sait, j'le met en musique
Vos médias le taisent, j'le rends public
J'vous tiens tête comme un mec des Minguettes
Est-ce le genre de texte qui peut me valoir une fiche S?

Droit dans mes bottes
Je n'baisse jamais mon froc
La tête haute j'suis intègre
J'fais du Hip-Hop
Vous appelez ça de la musique nègre
J'sors en indé
Tu m'verras plus jamais
Mettre les pieds à Skyrock
(Jamais, jamais)
Ils n'aiment pas c'que je suis, c'que je défends, c'que je porte
C'est réciproque
Ils ont travesti le R-A-P
Je fais parti des rescapés
Ils ont encensé la médiocrité
Ils ont fait du Hip-Hop de la variété
Ils ont joué les clashs pour nous diviser
Tant que ça fait de l'audience, on peut s'allumer
Quand un rappeur se fera buter
Ils organiseront un concert au nom de la paix
Yeah!
J'fais d'la musique contestataire
Vous vendez des espaces publicitaires
Racailles!
J'me suis sacrifié pour mes p'tits frères
Vous vous jouez des trucs qui les envoient au cimetière
Racailles!
Fric et violence dans vos playlists
Vous abrutissez les miens, ça plait aux élites
Racailles!
Vous vous êtes servi de moi, j'me suis servi de vous
Pour que mon message passe au plus grand nombre, maintenant j'peux le faire sans vous
J'ai un public qui me soutient
J'ai fait des choses, le peuple s'en souvient
La rue vous vomit, j'le rends public
Rien n'a changé depuis Lettre à la République",Racailles
Kery James,"T'écris dans l'encre, j'écris dans les larmes
Mes frères me manquent, j'ai vécu des drames
Je viens d'la rue, je ne fais pas semblant
J'ai fait des ke-tru qu'on ne fait pas sans gants

Qu'est-ce que tu croyais? (Qu'est-ce que tu croyais?)
Dans mes yeux noirs, qu'est-ce que tu voyais?
Ils ont tué mon pote, ils ont brûlé son corps
La souffrance que je porte défie ton hardcore

Je ne suis pas un gangster de studio

À tous ceux qu'ont un pote ou un frère qui s'est fait buter
À toutes les mères qui se sentent comme amputées
À tous les pères qui ne pleurent qu'une fois isolés

Kery James,"Courage
L’orage
La grisaille
Les Cisaille

Il est naturel d'avoir peur, de là naît le courage
Comment rêver en couleur quand l'futur n'annonce que l'orage
Le bonheur que l'on bricole disparaît dans la grisaille
Que nos espoirs s'isolent de la folie qui les cisaille
Ensanglantées d'amertume, des journées de ténèbres
Aux aurores teintées de brumes, exhume des rancunes funèbres
Une chorale de sanglots, chantonne nos afflictions
Transporte nos fardeaux, fredonne nos désolations
La haine nous fait du pied, nous propose une danse
Mortelle et rythmée, au tempo de nos vengeances
Si les rêves de paix, sommeillent certainement en chacun
On peut perdre son humanité dans un labyrinthe de chagrin
Comment raisonner, face aux soldats de la démence
La peur nous fera prisonnier des ennemis de la clémence
Architectes de la destruction, maçons de l'horreur
Cultivateurs d'abomination, qui confondent beauté et laideur
Mémoire et aigreur, désir de justice et fureur
Tirent sur la foule des balles aussi aveugles que leur cœur
Plongés dans l'excès, noyés dans la vanité
Les plus ignorants se croient l'élite de l'humanité
Les folies de la colère, nous révèlent à nous-même
On n'sait c'que l'on tolère, qu'une fois face à l'extrême
Un seul tonnerre de violence, assourdit nos beaux discours
Et nous v'là prêt à jeter la France dans la guerre civile d'Eric Zemmour
C'est le jeu de la division, du commerce, de la terreur
Comment faire sombrer la Nation dans la déraison puis l'horreur
Des chefs d'orchestres sordides, instrumentalisent nos peines
De piètres cupides qui détestent plus qu'ils n'aiment
Ceux qui désirent l'affrontement, souvent ignorent sa réalité
Leur arrogance n'a d'égal que leur lâcheté
Ils soufflent sur des braises, planqués dans leur confort
Nous chantent la Marseillaise tant que la mort reste inodore
Ils pensent la guerre, mais ne porteront jamais le treillis
Quand on manquera de cimetières, ils fuiront le pays
Le laissant livré à lui-même, à feu et à sang
Derrière les couleurs du drapeau se cachent ces ennemis de la Nation
Semeurs de troubles, fourbes, névrosés
Cracheurs de venin au cœur sclérosé
Racistes décomplexés qui conceptualisent la haine
Mais même les Nazis, avaient leurs propres intellectuels
Tirons des leçons du passé, y'a même pas 100 ans l'impensable est devenu vérité
Leurs paroles mettent des mots sur ce que leur cœur souhaite en secret
Ils n'se sentiront apaisés que lorsque les musulmans seront traqués
Lorsque les musulmans seront brusqués, persécutés pour leurs choix
Lorsque les musulmans seront parqués, exécutés pour leur foi
Ils veulent nous plonger, dans une guerre totale sans lendemain
En cela les terroristes et eux, poursuivent le même dessein
À bout d'souffle, la France est en apnée
Maintenant on s'rend compte à quel point précieuse est la paix
Faut-il perdre un bienfait pour en apprécier la valeur?
Faut-il s'approcher du feu pour en constater la chaleur?
Dans c'monde globalisé, Bagdad n'est plus si loin
Et nous n'avons qu'effleuré, l'horreur de leur quotidien
Brutal est le réveil, de nos années d'insouciance
Combien de peuples s'éveillent, chaque jour sous l'état d'urgence
Emplis de compassion, quand la terreur nous assiège
On a d'autres préoccupations, que de jouir de nos privilèges
De la Libye à la Syrie, ils reproduisent les mêmes erreurs
Leur politique extérieure nous fait saigner de l'intérieur
Expansion guerrière, à peine maquillée
Ambitions pécuniaires, sous couvert d'humanité
Condamnations arbitraires puis silences injustifiés
Utilisation vulgaire du concept de liberté
Pour la survie des vôtres, est-c'que la mort des autres est vitale?
Des frappes chirurgicales, ah bon? Sur un hôpital?
Comment condamner ici, tout en finançant là-bas?
Nous sommes otages de vos jeux de pouvoirs que vous faites passer pour des combats
Du sang sur les mains, du pétrole dans la rétine
Les prétendus droits humains, chaque jours ils les piétinent
Soutiennent ceux qui les combattent, combattent ceux qu'ils soutiennent
Démagogues bureaucrates, politique schizophrène

La haine nous colle comme une ombre
Depuis qu'les faucons tirent sur les colombes
J'essaie encore de me montrer aimant
Un sain d'esprit gouverné par des déments
On n'a plus pied dans cette mer de sang
Nos désirs de paix nagent à contre-courant
La pluie a beau tomber sur les cœurs asséchés
On voit rarement fleurir les rochers
La paix n'est qu'un cessez l'feu
Car certains rient de c'qui nous émeut
Pendant qu'les fous tailladent des innocents
Je m'évade dans le sourire d'un enfant
Chacune de nos nuits attend son soleil
Faut-il que l'on meure pour quitter le sommeil
On n'a plus l'choix et il me semble
On doit vivre ou mourir ensemble",Vivre ou mourir ensemble

Too many single nights, too busy even to choose.

There's no me without you

Keshia Chanté,"I know its late baby 
I've been dialing your number all day, 
Got me missin' you like crazy 
You actin' like you hate me 
Yes I know I was wrong I just want you back 
Just say you'll take me 
It just can't be over 
You took away your phone calls and kisses, 
I thought that we were closer 
You're givin' me the could shoulder 
When I want your warm hugs and kisses 
That's what I need the most 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone 

I can't respect your feelings 
So tell me when you thought about it, 
Did you think of me at all 
You don't seem to be affected 
I'm tryin' to correct it 
You shoot me down, how could you watch me fall 
I make mistakes that don't mean that I don't love you 
I'll learn to love you more, whatever, just let me know 
I feel so empty 'cause you've taken your love out my life 
I'll keep you happy darling don't let me go 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone 

This time I'll say I love you every time we speak, 
Make you a priority, be your strength when you are
Weak 
This time whenever you call me I'll be there, 
No matter what I'm doin' I will come no matter where 
This time I'll give you all the lovin' that I got, 
Say the right things,
I don't wanna lose what I got 
And I don't wanna hurt no more, 
But you got down baby open up the door and let me in 

It's like Bonnie with no Clyde without you by my side 
It's like a part of me died away 
Since you been gone 
If I spend some time without you thought I'd be okay 
I can't replace you, I tried, it didn't work out that way 
So tell me where will you go, 
And tell me who's gonna love you like I do 
Since you been gone 
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
Since you been gone",Been Gone
Keshia Chanté,"So good to finally 
Get where we need to be 
Cause I was so close to losing my mind 
Right now is the time 
Made for you and I to do whatever we would like 
Without a care or fear cause were in 

In a place that we always dreamed of 
Where we can breathe and be free with our love 
A place where we can clear our heads and forget about what 
Everyone says 

I can't believe that we're finally here 
A zone that just can't be found anywhere 
Something so special that only we can share (i can't believe) 
I can't believe that were finally here 
It was well worth the wait my dear 
I'm so happy you got me flowing teams - of joy 

It's all overwhelming me 
To the point where I don't wanna leave 
But if I got to I just wanna make sure 
We can always come back,always come back for me 
Of this blissful life,I always see when I close my eyes 
And the memories I have to remind me 
Keep me wanting to be 

That's all I can say,cause I'm so happy 
(I'm so happy so happy finally) 
Thank you for making me so so happy 
I can't believe 

joy, mm
Uh no no 
I can't believe",Can't Believe
Keshia Chanté,"It can be a hundred degrees in the shade
I won't complain about a thing I'm over it
Got a fan blowin' on me man 
I'm so cool on you don't you understand

[Chorus]
Like the wind in November
That was cold what you did I ain't bitter
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, so cool on you babe
All the games that you played
Got my heart growin' cold like a cube in a tray
I'm cool on you babe, I'm cool on you babe
I'm cool on you babe, so cool on you babe

Dinner cookin' 
A good book to read
And a place to rest my feet
I sit and I wait for the breeze
Blow through my window ledge
To help me clear my head I'm sorry I 
Can't be that girl 
Who waits on the side
For my man to come back right
Got too much respect for myself
I knew this all too well 
I can't let you waste my time

[Chorus]

Call up that girl you met at the club
Cause I'm not your one night love
I'm not gonna be number 3
Cause I would rather leave
Heartbreak and pain ain't in my destiny
You're like a cross between back taxes and
Bad traffic, I'm through
I can't be messin' with you
Build me up just to bring me down
I'm running out of reasons to stick around

[Chorus]

When you realize that you had a good thing
Don't even try I'm off doing my own thing
Cause I realize the way you are is how you'll be
Imma be alright, I don't need you comin' around
Keepin' me leveled to the ground
I don't make the rules, 
You snooze, you lose
Do what you choose I'm cool on you

[Chorus]

Boy I'm see double O, L 
Can't you tell that I'm cool on you
That I'm cool on you
Boy I'm see double O, L 
Can't you tell that I'm cool on you
That I'm cool on you
That was cold what you did to me (Hey, Hey, Hey)

Ha, I'm over you!",Cool on You
Keshia Chanté,"We was just walking,just smiling and talking 
Then add to my surprise, got lost in your eyes 
This time they were different, and I found what it meant 
After I leaned in, I helplessly fell in 

Help me I've fallen in love, and now I can't get up 
Somewhere between your lips, is where I think my heart slipped 
I tried to catch myself, not even I could have helped myself from 
Falling 
I think that I'm in love 

In love and I can't see, what's happening to me 
You blinded my thoughts, from what pain and tears taught 
See my hearts been broken before,it don't trust love anymore 
One kiss from you, I just let myself fall right through 

Got me hypnotized with your magic spell, I got butterflies can't 
Control myself 
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you, it's true, don't know 
What to do 
Don't stop now 
Since I let you in 
You showed me how 
You showed me how to love again, 
I've fallen please help me 

Got me hypnotized with your magic spell, I think that I'm in love 
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you, I think that I'm in love 
It's true,don't know what to do,don't stop now, I can't get up 
It's true, don't know what to do, don't stop now, I think that I'm in 
Love,in love",Fallen
Keshia Chanté,"I was working at the mall after school on a Friday 
You were with your mom, don't know what you were buying 
We made eye-contact, through the tee-shirt rack 
And I was hoping that you would say something to me (but you didn't) 
But you were too afraid to talk while your momma was present 
So when she left the store you came back in cause you left something 
Slipped your number to me, on the back of the receipt 
And you made me promise I would call you later (And I did) 
I thought I knew it 

[Chorus] 
Thought I knew it from the first time I saw you 
Thought I knew it from the first time we met 
Thought I knew it from the first time we kicked it 
But I knew it from the first time we kissed (when we kissed) 
It felt just like we fell in love (when we kissed) 
I know right then I fell in love (when we kissed) 
Your lips showed me the purest love (when we kissed) 

When I got home from work it was 9 in the evening 
When we got off the phone it was 9 in the morning 
Now its Saturday, so we planned a date 
To meet up at 6 o'clock at the movies 
We got there (got some snacks) 
Some drinks (it was dark) 
So we sat (in the back) 
That's when you (stole my heart) 
Cause you kissed me, didn't know you would kiss me 
And I loved every bit fell in love with your kiss 

[Chorus] 

The touch of your hand, is where it began 
The feel of your heart, still wasn't enough 
But everything changed, on our first date 
Boy that's when it hit me, the moment you kissed me 
The touch of your hand, is where it began 
The feel of your heart, still wasn't enough 
But everything changed, on our first date 
Boy that's when it hit me, the moment you kissed me 

[Chorus] 

We kissed. 
We kissed, when we kissed, I thought I fell in love",Kiss
Keshia Chanté,"Why you keep telling me that, 
You ain't never coming back, that's too hard to take, 
Can you at least hear me out first? 
Though you think that I'm the worst, I made a mistake 
I never thought I made you feel I didn't care, 
I know that I have hurt you,but you leaving just ain't fair 
Here is my apology 

I'm sorry, for ever thinking of myself 
Forgive me don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no,no,no,no

Your like nothing that I've had before, I love your name 
I have let you down and baby I'm the one to blame 
This letter that I've written isn't something that I do 
That's why you must believe,that I'm still in love with you 
This is my apology 

I can't think right 
My days seem night 
Cause it's so cold 
And baby I know that 
Me alone ain't good 
I said, me alone ain't good 
I can't see straight 
Please heal my fate 
Don't run away 
I need you to stay cause 
Me alone ain't good 
I said, me alone ain't good

Forgive me, don't want you loving no one else 
Stay with me, don't want to feel the way you felt 
Oh no no, no, no, no,no,no

Keshia Chanté,"We don't listen when you yelling and telling us,
Call us young dumb and rebellious, 
(Belly rings how we wear our clothes) 
Cannot, will not, live our lives the way you do yours, 
You get one life and we won't be bored 
So we flip through tricks off a skateboard, 
We know you scared for us, 'cause you care for us, 
Just be there for us and let us breathe 

Hey teachers, not another one of your long speeches 
How there's no hope and you can't reach us 
Why can't we be us, just jump up, rip off the bleachers and 

Stomp, soon as you hear the system thump 
I need to feel that, pop the trunk, 
All my ladies you wit me? 
Fellas if you feel me,feel 
I want you to get up, I wanna see you jump and 
Stomp, soon as you feel the system thump 
I wanna feel that bump,bump,bump 
All my ladies you wit me? 
Fellas if you feel me,feel me, 
I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya stomp 

Were not listening when you scream and yell 
With your parental judgmental selves 
Like you never been young before 
We cannot, will not, live our lives the way you yours 
We get one life and we won't be scared, 
So throw your hands up in the air, 
Instead of crowding us and doubting us, 
You outta be proud of us, and let us breathe 
Hey teachers, not another one of your long speeches 
How there's no hope and you can't reach us 
Why can't we be us,just jump up, rip off the bleachers and 

'Cause we've had enough and 
We've had it up to here, and 
All we wanna do is have some fun, so please 
Don't suffocate us, let us breathe, breathe, breathe 
We've had enough and 
We've had it up to here, 
All we wanna is have some fun,so please 
Don't suffocate us, let us breathe, breathe, breathe

All my Ladies",Stomp
Keshia Chanté,"I looked in his pretty brown eyes and ever since I saw him 
I've been checking for him seriously 
And when he walks by I say hi 
He don't reply like he doesn't even notice me 
But I know its all a front 
I can tell he really wants to come close and kick it to me 
But he's running out of time 
Hurry up and make up your mind 

[Chorus] 
I'm falling like autumn leaves 
You call like a winter breeze 
Can't wait til spring comes and leaves 
Cause I miss what I was getting in the summer time 
I remember (remember my) 

Summer love, summer love (remember my) 
Summer love, summer love 
Now that its cold I don't know here to go 
I can't wait for the seasons to change to bring me back to my 
Summer love, summer love (I remember my) 
Summer love, summer love (I remember my) 
Summer love, summer love 
All I want is to take back the day we had to say goodbye 

I would of held on really tight 
If I would of realized that night we were gonna part 
Drove me crazy to go and even though I'm gone 
I left him with a piece of my heart 
Though the seasons change my feelings remain 
And I know they will always be 
Until I find my summer love, he's all ill be thinking of

Summer love, summer love (remember my)

Now that its cold I don't know here to go

Summer love, summer love 
All I want is to take back the day we had to say goodbye 

I'm just telling you what you told me baby, 
Never thought you could be so cold to me baby 
Just when I thought you would go with me baby 
Where did you go my summer love? 
Either I'm confused or you lied to me baby 
Why you couldn't be here to ride with me baby? 
In the middle of July you leave baby 
Where did you go my summer love? 

[Chorus] 

We had to say goodbye, we had to say goodbye",Summer Love
Keshia Chanté,"Is it really too much to ask? 

Why is it every time that I, 
Let go show love to someone else 
I make a fool out of myself (please tell me why) 
Look at me, how I fit these jeans 
Why can I find a fit for me? 
A guy to give me what I need (please tell me why)

No birthday card, no gift, no call 
No hug, can't kiss, not in the hall 
Is he even my man at all, 'cause that just ain't right 
A girl like me, needs to be, with somebody, who can handle all of me 
I need a guy that will ride for me, is it really too much?

Keshia Chanté,"Catching a flight from LA it's been three weeks I've seen your face
Touching down at a quarter past three 
Lucky you, you must be home asleep
I wait for my bags, they're taking so long. 
'Bout to call a cab to take me home
That's I feel a touch from behind. 
Turn around you're right before my eyes.

Standing there, I can't believe you came
It's 3 o'clock in the morning and it's pouring rain
There's something about the kinda love that you bring
Can't put my finger on it, guess it must be 

All these things
The little things that you do
They make my heart beat for you
All these things
The little things mean so much
You remind me each time we touch
Of all the little things

I sleep through the morning and wake up at two, 
Just can't wait to spend the day with you
I head downstairs and the first thing 
I see is a note there waiting saying

""there's a concert tonight I thought you'd want to go
I hear dat Alicia's got a real good show""
Sometimes it seems you think of everything
You never cease to amaze. You know I'm loving

All these things
The little things that you do
They make my heart beat for you
All these things
The little things mean so much
You remind me each time we touch

Just me and my clique
I made sure that we wasn't late
'Cause the movie's starting at eight

Lights down I'm ready to go
Walking on down the runway

Keshia Chanté,"Me and my girls hangin' out tonight
We decide we gonna step in line for the club, to see what's up
Didn't know if we was getting in
No ID, we don't got anything to show, oh no

Oh my God! Tell me what do I see
A hunny right in front of me and he's clockin' me
He steps through. I hope that I would too
Then the bouncer takes one look at me ""what are you fifteen?""

You know you had me spinnin'
Right from the beginnin'
When you put dat record on 
You know I'm bouts to get my groove on
And I can't even imagine
If this thing didn't happen
The night is just beginnin'
And I'm already spinnin'

I tell the bouncer ""I'm herre all the time""
Didn't believe me, said he heard that line before, and many more.
I try to tell that I'm 21 (nuh, uh girl)
Come on man ""I just look real young"" Cuh huh.

I say ""please you gots to be to cool with me""
Then he smiled and said ""okay, alright but just for tonight""
I step inside. And right there before my eyes
He's in the DJ booth with headphones on,
And he's playing my song, Oh my God! 

Got me spinnin' right round like a record baby!",Spinnin'

Keshia Chanté,"I been thinkin' about, all the things you said to me
And now I'm tryin' to figure out, if this is where I want to be
But I must admit, boy you almost had me there 
When you first told me, how you really, really cared

But I've gotta let you know, we've got our whole lives, take it slow
I ain't tryin' to mess your flow, but I'm not gonna let it go
You gotta keep it in control, no matter what you do I'll still say no
What you really gotta show, that you want me for much more

Don't say that you love me, boy
And that you're always thinkin' of me, boy
It don't matter if it's wrong or right
This ain't goin' down tonight
Don't tell me I'm your everything
And that you want me to wear your ring
I ain't tryin' to start Sa fight
But, this ain't goin' down tonight

I got no doubt you're everything you claim to be
But try to understand I gotta do what's right for me
Don't turn away, good things come to those who wait
Stop pressurin' me, 'cause that will only complicate

The good times that we shared, chillin' out without a care
The games of truth or dare, on our friendship we did swear
You'd run your fingers through my hair-a feeling I just can't compare
You know this isn't fair- why'd you go and take it there",Tonight
Keshia Chanté,"I needed a friend and you were there like a brother
Through good times and bad, always there for me
We were so tight I trusted you like no other
Now I miss you so much, the way you made me feel

Cause we would talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home
Now looking back I guess I should have known
But I, I couldn't see it, now I feel it
Tell me how did I miss that
I'd give the world if I could just go back
To the day when ""friends"" was all you had in mind 
But now I see the true colors in your eyes

Then you stepped to me in a way that was more than I wanted
And when I said ""No! I don't feel that way bout you""
The look on you face, said everything. 
And I got it.
And now I know I was right 
'Cause it's been weeks since I heard from you

We used to talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home
Now looking back I guess I should have known
But I, I couldn't see it, now I feel it
Tell me how did I miss that
I'd give the world if I could just go back 
To the day when ""friends"" was all you had in mind 

But now I see the true colors in your eyes
Was everything we had a lie
Tell me now baby
Thought I knew you, thought it was true
I though that I had something special with you 
Ooh, why'd you have to go and
Ruin, such a good thing and,
We were so tight, thought it was right
And sometimes I wish was you was back in my life

Cause we would talk for hours on the phone
And you were always there to walk me home

Keshia Chanté,"In the midst of the night, in the midst of the night
When everyone sleeps, he comes out form where he hides
It's a different life, filled with hurt, filled with fright
And for me what's love, and he tries and he tries

Our feelings need tonight I'm fly towards the light, but it's just not right, it's just not right

It's ridiculous, I'm feeling so un-natural
I just wanna give it up, just wanna loose it now
Now live my life without your ghost love
It's ridiculous, I'm feeling so un-natural
I just wanna give it up, just wanna loose it
Now live my life without your being, a ghost love, a ghost love

I'm so moved by his touch, I'm so moved by his touch
In his arms I'm wrapped up, feel so good but it's wrong
To know that he's never real, and he ain't gonna be
Nothing but a mystery
Feels like I'm way past the clouds, I'm being pulled to the other side, the other side

I've held onto so long
Will come out

Out the things

Stay outta sight

Keter Betts,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way

To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day

Gave congratulations,

We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

They look at him and they look at me
But it`s only themselves they`re wanting to see

Everyone`s dressed and standing around
Alice is wearing her sexiest gown
But she doesn`t want you to look at her

But he`s up at the other end of town
Trying to talk to the mirror

He sits on the floor and has beautiful dreams
Then he gets brought down by a woman who screams
But he knows it`s only a record¡­ Oh yes it is

His brave new girl stops feeding the ants
And looks at him with her septic pants
She still knows how to make him dance
And forget about emancipation¡­ it`s just imagination

We know something`s got to come
And get us off our endless bum

In fact I don`t know anything at all",Song for Insane Times
Kevin Ayers,"On a railway train to anywhere,
Something happened finally.
The driver said he saw no station
And we were riding aimlessly.

The train was filled with sleeping passengers,
Going nowhere for the ride;
Spoken whispers filled the carriages
No one cared to look outside.

Conversation aimed at anyone
Bouncing questions off the wall;
Except for two excited children.
Burning caterpillars in the hall.

All at once, I got quite frightened..
Standing up, I gave a shout!
""I see a station just in front of me ,
Stop this train and let me out!""

The driver smiled and shook his head for me,
""this train don't stop for anyone.
And, if you want to leave this railway line,
You'll have to jump off on your own.

Someone came and gave me sandwiches,
Saying that I looked unwell.
He took my pulse and he gave it back to me,
And then he hit me with his bell.

He made a speech to all the passengers,
He said ""I've been a place today;
And anyone who'd care to come with me..
Step outside and walk this way.""

Inside the seats were warm and comfortable,
Outside the train was wild and strange.
I said, ""yes, sir, I'd like to come with you,
It's really time I made a change.""

I left my seat and walked up front with him,
And he began to push the door.
I looked outside, but it nearly blinded me..
I'd never seen such light before.
",Stop This Train (Again Doing It)
Kevin Ayers,"Today, the town seems like a tomb; 
Everybody`s locked up in his room;
Making love, or taking love--who cares?

If you take a walk out in the street, 
Chances are there`s someone that you`ll meet.
If it`s someone you know
You`ll say hello, and good-bye.

Today`s the very first day of the Spring; 
A little girl`s playing on her swing. 
She doesn't know that a brand new show begins.

Now you come and tell me that you`re sad; 
But you never talk. about it when you`re glad; 
You criticize, and you shut your eyes...
That`s too bad.",Town Feeling

Just trying to hold on to my head

You'll find me crawling on the floor 
Just looking for the things you threw away. 

You're the one illusion 
Causing my confusion
My dreams are yours to borrow 
I know I'll get them back tomorrow 
And I know your love has turned to wine

Times are full of Pumpkin People
They appear and they fade away 
I'm just moonlight's lost disciple 
Trying to bring your love my way

Or you're going to wind up in the ditch
Just looking for the things you threw away.",Lunatics Lament

Makes me think of you,
Sunshine and this crazy wine,
There is loving too,

One thing that I think I've learned,
Loving must be free,
So much energy is burned in pointless jealousy,

I just want to sing for you,
Yes I do.

You're such a magical child
I found that
The first time you smiled

And the more i get to know you
The more I am amazed
To find in someone
Such tender loving ways

When the sunshine makes them high
I sing this gentle love song

Really try
But I just don't get any-

You might say it only
Seems that way. And
I could find something
Everywhere. And
Maybe I agree with
You. But I'd
Just like to say this
Too. Its
All very fine, if you're
Really divine. And
Everybody wants you
Bad. You can
Take what you please with the
Greatest of ease. And
Nobody will let you be
Sa-a-ad. But
Oh my, the
Days go by. I
Make no connection at
All. I
Drink this wine in the
Bright sunshine. A-
Waiting for a star to
Fa-a-all. I
Must be like a million
Souls, who
Got nobody at
All. To
Warm their hearts, and
Give them a start,
Spinning in the bright blue
Sky. On the
Wings of love that could
Take them above, to
Places where the penguins
Fly-why-y. But
Oh my. Do
I get high
Lady, when I'm next to
You. You're so
Crazy and wild, such a
Happy child. You
Make a lot of loving

",Oh My
Kevin Ayers,"This is a song from the bottom of a well
There are things down here
I've got to try and tell;
It's dark and light at the very same time, 
The water sometimes seems like wine.

I learned some information way down here
That might fill your heart and soul with fear;
But don't you worry, no don't be afraid
I'm not in the magical mystery trade.

My imagination begins to purr
As things don't happen, they just occur.
Softly crackling electrical smell,
There's something burning at the bottom of this well.

Sitting here alone I just have to laugh
I see all the universe as a comfortable bath; 
I drown my body so my mind is free
To indulge in pleasurable fantasies.

There's something strange going on down here 
A sickening implosion of mistrust and fear. 
A vast corruption that's about to boil
A mixture of greed and the smell of oil.

This is a song from the bottom of a well 
I didn't move here, I just fell.
But I'm not complaining, I don't even care 
Cause if I'm not here, then it's not there.",Song from the Bottom of a Well
Kevin Ayers,"I'm looking 'round madly
for something to find 
That might give se a front
To put something, something behind.

Just bouncing this ball
Up and down the hall
But it's full of best wishes
and suffocating fishes, and all.

So, let's drink some wine
And have a good time.
But if you really want to come through 
Let the good time, good time have you. 
It's what you've got to do.

You said it was foolish
for me to be sad;
But I'm very hungry, and you..
You're very well fed,
You're such a fat lady.

And I'm talking to you
just for something to do
'Cause I'd much rather kiss you 
But I know, I'm gonna miss you
Again and again, I know I'm gonna miss you.

So, let's drink some wine, etc.

I sing to the island
That sings in your head
'Cause I know you'd much rather be there 
Be there instead.
I know you'd rather be there...

But you won't find the answer 
Even when the wind blows;
'Cause the answer, my friend
is in front..
Right there in front of your nose 
Everybody knows, it's their nose.

Kevin Ayers,"Watch her out there on display
Dancing in her sleepy way
While all her visions start to play
On the icicles of our decay.

Fading flowers in her hair
She's suffering from wear and tear
She lies in waterfalls of dreams
And never questions what it means.

And all along the desert shore
She wanders further evermore
The only thing that's left to tryÂ¡Â­
She says to live I have to die.

She whispers sadly well I might
And holds herself so very tight
Then jumping from an unknown height
She merges with the liquid night.

Lovers wrap her mist in furs
And tell her what she has is hers
But when they take her by the hand
She slips back in the desert sand.

But what she leaves is made of glass
And lovers worship as they pass
Each one says - now she is mine
But all drink solitary wine.

So many drowned and wasting away

Everybody wants to be free

That smells just like treasure
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Dancin' with a rich man
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Kissing the feet of you
While listening to bonsais
And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria

Passionate love with you
Hearing you, ""Oh, oui oui""
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire’s gallery

As we move, then we touch, then we dip
Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance?
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Dancin' with a rich man
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

And when you'll elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors

Sunsets on yellow sand
That’s where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

Yes I do,
And I love you",Yes I Do
Kevin Ayers,"There was moonlight and laughter
That danced on the sands 
And bloodstained pianos 
Are played without hands

Such a promising music
Sweet whispers and dreams 
From a traveling window, 
The salesman who screamed.

Moonlight, Saturday night
It`s now or never
Oh play Stormy Weather, 
for me, for me.

I lived in the flower shop 
Called ""Love is So Sweet!""
And I get all my kicks
From the customers` feet.

Well, I`m just a stranger,
None stranger than I.
My head in the quicksand
My feet in the sky.

I was carefully crazy 
When playing the game.
`Cause business is business
And I`m not to blame.

It`s a wet afternoon ;
A bottle of booze,
A bit of a tune to sing;
Goodbye, everything;

Paper chases, human races
Magical.

Kevin Ayers,"As the doors all close
And the wind blows rows 
And the moonlight flows
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere.
As the stars collide
And the horsemen glide 
And my mind just slides
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere.

And the streams stream streams 
And my dreams dream dreams 
And the question screams
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere.

As the dawn warm forms 
On the well-kept lawns 
Of the pawns that swarm
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere.

And the song returns
To a heart that yearns 
For a flame that burns
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere.",A View from the Mountain
Kevin Ayers,"So I give my heart to you
Though I can't be sure
You won't take it and break it
And hurt me
I've been hurt so many times before

We can play those games of love
Like other people do
But that's not me or you
It's just everyone else
Is all dreams and I want something new

And there are no guarantees
That can set your heart at ease
'cause no one ever knows
How the feeling comes and goes
When you're sure it's so strong
It can never go wrong
It'll always go on and
Then suddenly it goes

Only brave hearts live their love
Weak hearts hide in dreams
Living lives in romance
Leaving danger and chance
To the warriors of love

And there are no guarantees
That can set your heart at ease
'cause no one ever knows
How the feeling comes and goes
When you're sure it's so strong
It can never go wrong
It'll always go on and
Then suddenly it's gone

So I give my heart to you
Though I can't be sure
You won't take it and break it
And hurt me
I've been hurt so many times before

If I'm here all alone?
And why am I feeling
So far from home?

A bottle of wine
Just look at all those stars
You're gonna have a good time.

With the wolf and the owl;
Oh, what does it matter
If you scream or you howl?

And, where do the stars end
If I'm here all alone?
And why am I feeling
So far from home?

Who comes knocking at your door.
Gives you a sweet taste
Leaves you howling for more.

Asked how you're feeling
You said you weren't sure

And I came down beside you with the moon in my head

I whispered nothing sweetly in your ear

Kevin Ayers,"You're safe and you're warm
Got a break from the storm
And it's visiting time in the past
And you've just reached the part
Where you're losing your heart
And your spirit is leaving you fast

A then the storm blows a scream
And it crashes your dream
Like a fist through the curtain of glass
And there's a giant of darkness
Surrounds you with fright
And the only way out is to stand up and fight

And so you shout, scream
Give me back my dream
I need one to get through the day
If it's lost and if it's gone
I won't keep hanging on
And the storm can just blow me away
Blow me away

It's a long way till dawn
And you've got to get warm
'Cause you're shivering deeply inside
So you turn on the light
Try to burn up the night
But your spirit has run off to hide

There's nowhere to run
So you wait for the sun
Nowhere to run
You wait for the sun

Shout, scream
Give me back my dream
I need one to get through the day
If it's lost and if it's gone
I won't keep hanging on
And the storm can just blow me away

As I grow older
Nothing seems to be clearer
Than before, um hum

Become cold shoulders

We're afraid to take
Too many chances

We must keep in step

And painted the blues away

You need a prize to win

And all the funfair's will have one

You step outside your rage

The children in the lake?
I didn't see them go under
Let's try another take

Pass me the bottle, baby
One day you'll understand
We almost make the same mistakes
And hold each other's hands

Feeling too much doubt and fear
I hide and run, I run and hide

You have to admit, babe,

And, where do the stars end
If I'm here all alone?
And why am I feeling
So far from home?

Spoonful of moonlight
A bottle of wine
Just look at all those stars
You're gonna have a good time.

Out there in the darkness
With the wolf and the owl;
Oh, what does it matter
If you scream or you howl?

And, where do the stars end
If I'm here all alone?
And why am I feeling
So far from home?

Love is that stranger
Who comes knocking at your door.
Gives you a sweet taste
Leaves you howling for more.

You get that taste
You've got to take it;

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

I can see it in your eyes

With every single breath I'm gonna love you
Fall into my arms tonight
And make it allright

Let me be the one to break it to you
I'm gonna love you endlessly

But as long as you are with me
I am happy to be someone

That changed it all
You're the nights I will remember
For as long as I am walking on this earth

With every bit of me with all my heart
With every single breath I'm here for you now

If you believe me

Standing here with you
You brought me something
Right out of nothing

And in those dreams you leave this old world behind
Yeah, I know how hard you've been trying
In a world that you just ain't buying

Drifting off with the rest of your yesterdays, some how
Yeah, I know it's hard to keep on fighting

Never mind the things they might say about you
They can talk but they can never ever hurt you
They can never take your dreams away from you

Someday you will be far from here
And all your troubles will have disappeared
When you go, girl, don't worry about me

Kevin Costner,"I heard a Spanish melody
Drifting along Nogales Street
In the shadows the accordion man
Danced on the keys with his long brown hands
Playin' a song just for you and me
Down in Nogales

I put a dollar in his empty hat then we sat on a wall
Scared off an old stray cat
Together we saw the clouds roll in
From the gulf of Mexico the wind was singing
And the sky was turning black
Down in Nogales

And in your hand you were holding a flower you found
On the side of the road you were twirling it round and around
And I ? I was dreaming of you
Seeing you smiling and laughing and then
The rain came down

Down in Nogales the rain fell
On the bright umbrellas and the tombstones
And the statues near the graveyard walls
Where the weeds grow and the raven calls
And the tall girl talking in the long blue dress on her cell phone
Down in Nogales",Down in Nogales

To my own heart I tried to be true

I have been waiting for life to begin
For something to do something to hold
That was bigger than I
Whatever I did it was never enough
Wherever I stood I was still out of touch
Like a man in the dark following sparks
Through an ebony sky

Like it or no I have come to this place
The past in my heart the wind in my face
And a son who was born on the eve of a war
Of reckless design
With my knees to the earth and my ear to the ground

Of a shot in the wind the beginning my friend

Trying to find a way to get on track
But I'm spinning wheels and looking back
Just spinning wheels looking back

Car tires squealing
For a moment I wonder where I am
I'm right here in this little hot house
With no one beside me
Listening to the wobble of the ceiling fan

And the night might never end

The sun, it will rise again

Yeah, we're gonna be alright, my friend
Yeah, the sun, it will rise again

I had a dream while I was sleeping
Here beside this broken road
Felt like a man without a shadow on my back
And I'd run as far as I could go

Now I wake up in this darkness
Pray for daylight to touch our land
I hear the morning like a promise in my ear
The sun, it will rise again
Oh, the sun, it will rise again

On my motorbike, yeah, it will take me anywhere I want to go,

I can help you along
Give you some sustenance
I'll keep you strong

I've given you my lucky charm

One pair of knives
One pair of goggles, baby
Two glass eyes

So, when you see me, baby
I don't want to see you cry
That would only hurt me, baby
Only make me lie

My intentions are unsure now
I'm all qualified to lie
I have myself a bright white coat
I can help you to fly

Alright, the next patient, Miss Faversham
Is someone we know very well
We saw her out in the garden with the flowers
And she was crying

But she needs help
And I've told her to come to the top floor

Kevin Coyne,"White horse, riding across my mind
Wearing a band of gold around your hooves
Collecting the stars, the glint of the stars
In your great and empty eye

The drink I drink is a drink as strong as
The strongest poison in the land
Riding on the back of my horse with his golden band
Who catches the stars in his eye

His great and empty eye
That had never smiled, never noticed me
I would like to think of that he dreamt of me
When he went to sleep at night

That he thought I was the special thing in his life
But to those great eyes, they see nothing
They don't profess poetry
Don't profess insight into me

Now I stand on empty man
Beside the stable door on the stud farm
And the green and gray attendant
Hands me straw, says, ""Go feed the horses""

You know, of course he's a dreaming talking horse
Who wears gold bands around his feet
And dreams of stars, and dreams of stars
In his empty eye, in his empty eye

Score to settle

Says it was just his duty
That's why he volunteered

About
He says he'll see again someday

The problem was the choices that I made
Why did I choose not to notice

And I'll burn up three cigarettes, 'fore I have my first smoke.

And in a crowded elevator, I'll start hummin' that ol' song.

And I see your slender silhouette, dance across the wall.

Picking birthday cards and fingerscars
I guess she's lonelier than you

And if this box is empty
Go out and find another one
With a prettier design
And greater depth inside
And a lid to keep it from all spilling out
And you could fill it up with letters
From back when things were better
And both of you had blinders on
Read storybooks together

That you shaved off last week

That when it's longer, you remind me of her

With what passed for authority
A strict sort of challenge
That you directed straight at me
You said ""forget her, I don't care what you two were""

So it's a trick on your ego
A two-step off tempo
A solid gold bracelet
Under lights in a window
In some shopping mall
Where I never go

You play coy and count tiles
Drag your toes through the water
Raise your eyes, bite your lip
And my mind's in the gutter
You move at me and take my face in your hands

I feel light bulbs explode
And a fire crack thunder sends
The slow seismic shift
The sprawling cloud cover
But when we're finished
I feel awful again

So it's the same sorry story
Just the cast changes nightly
It skips like a record
But it glows like a movie
You're the country sky
That I never see

Shake in your voice
Makes me feel empty and ugly
All scattered anger like a windstorm
Howling violently
And I wanna fade out
And wake up somewhere else
Where no face is familiar
And I'm left by myself

On my own wasted time
To eat badly and spend all my money and write
To not feel too guilty

I'll leave them behind

Kevin Devine,"My friends are working on avoiding me
So when we meet I keep my mouth real busy
Talk out my nervous energy
It never works 
I throw darts at the wall and get sloppy

But it's alright now
If I seem surprised
It's just a joke I'm trying out
But if it floats I guess we'll keep it around

A woman gestures lazily
Through the hoods of my eyes
I see her shakin' her jewelry
It casts a perfect light on me
I feel moved and that's strange
But lately I've been acting really strangely

So it's alright now
I'm keeping distracted
To blunt my reactions
And anyhow
You think less 
When there's less for you to think about

A paralyzed puppet sits stiff in the window
Runnin' its teeth and playin' piano
And all its songs bleed together
In a flatline blur

Worthless words
Creatin' space while your drinks get served
And though it gets on your nerves

No never never
I found that hard to believe
Let's burn the furniture
To see how angry
The fire can make me

And you say that there's someone 
That you need to reconnect with
Some scarecrow from highschool 
That you loved and never slept with
A baby with a pipedream 
Playing hopscotch on your bandages

And I'm singing all these songs
While I sleep on your couch
I'm coughing up a lung
But I'm covering my mouth

And I paint you on the wall
Yellow, red, green, and brown
I miss you all the time
But I'm blocking it out

Are you better?
No never never
What does that say about me?
Now let's break the smoke alarm
To see how scared
Locked windows can make me

You say there's a stranger
Staring sideways in a deep freeze
A loner draped in ivy
Playing slumlord in his city dream
A faker with an art form
Pulling magic tricks 
On the weak girls up his sleeve

And I'm choking right along
With the words in my throat
I'm falling back in love
With the letter you wrote

And I think that I was wrong
But I guess I don't know
I figured that'll I wait

Kevin Devine,"A cadillac drives down my street
A bead of sweat pourin slow down a palm line
I see a bumper sticker
It's a bearded man with a wanted sign

A myth we've made to scare out fears away
A slogan that we slap on all our misdirected hate
A muddy symbol meant to mitigate our pain
But it's really just a desert corpse
We've painted on the wall out in some cave

Anyway
I don't know where he's gonna park that thing

My neighborhood drunk's on line at the deli
With his shaky hands and his swollen face he waits for his coffee
He blacks out curbside every night 
And every day crawls back towards wall street

So I don't see it like it's us and them
I just see everybody working for that same eternal weekend
Droning on and on and on and never doing what we wanted
Heavy legs two steps behind some forever dangling carrot

And I'm tired of this
So who's to say that we can't just fucking change it?

And I know it seems dramatic
But I treat it like a crisis
The office to the coffin
All our time and talent wasted
And that weight against your throat
Is that a noose dressed like a necklace?

From here I couldn't
Really tell the difference
Either way I say
Let's not take any chances

But goddamn
You got hot 
Hot enough to streak the streets white with sunspots when you walk
And I'm still obsessed with cowboys and Indians
And you bitin' your lip when you lose your breath

I'm not over you yet
I know I will not call
It's this decision I've made

So I'm up all night chanting 
Vow I can't break
I might bite my nails
So I can't scratch my face
But I'd still cut my hair if you asked the right way
I'd at least comb it anyway

Kevin Devine,"Oh baby baby please
I feel an urgent need to apologize
I did a terrible thing in a terrible dream
And now I can't look you in the eye

It started when we were out on the date
When we turned to say
""I gotta tell you something odd
I know I said we'd get married
But I'm already married""
And that's when you laughed so hard
So I turned and swung
I woke in a shock
My nails digging blood from the base of my palms

It's just that people are so fickle
They fall in love at different angles
And really I could lose you
Just as quickly as I've gotten you
And that's the kinda thought
That makes me nervous
I'm worried if you'll really think I'm worth it
When the rush wears off 
And you're left with this busted person
But if you tell me you will
I will do what I can to believe it

So baby all these things that I've seen
Last night while asleep
This morning they're messing with me
And now I'm anxious as hell
And looking for help
To the pleasant and painless 
Some story to tell
With a through line of calm
That could stop me from being myself

Cause all I think is how I want to be your fever
Just to know I make you heated
Cause I'm worried you might see me more like a blanket
Who's there for comfort and for cover
From the glare of former lovers
All the passion that kissed you and bit you
Til you were devoured
And I'd like to get better
Cause thinking like this is torture

And if I can't stop it
You'll be sick of bearing crosses
And you'll jump to cut your losses
You'll go get quarantined somewhere far from me
Where it's much less dangerous
Maybe if I wake up and quit dreaming
I could shake the shit I'm fearing
And I could feel like I'm just freaking out
For no good reason

The sun's steepling its shards on my floor 
I drag my feet to the shower and I hear someone singing 
I keep the lights off as the water gets warm 

Now I knot up tie and toss my books in a schoolbag 
They keep my priorties straight 
So I can sleepwalk through work like an outpatient program 
I don't buy but I'll get through anyway 

And at some point I'll call you and tell you I miss you 
And you are the point of my day 
And my face will get flushed and my throat will choke up 
When you tell me you feel the same 

So I have been thinking of splitting up Christmas
To see everyone I'd like to see 
And your first on that list
Your the lotto I hit

You're the star at the top of my tree 
And I have been feeling this good for a reason 
My friends and my family 
You are all the backbone 

You keep me balenced and settled 
And I""m in debt to you all endlessy 
So tonight I will call you and try to say 
""Thank you for being the sun on my face 

I know the world's almost over but you make it seem better
And I hope for you I do the same""",Splitting Up Christmas
Kevin Devine,"You get back here
You do it so slowly
Do it calm, now
Don't be so angry

I got something
I've been chasing
Every day since I started walking

It just sits here
In the distance
It always flirts with the tips of my fingers

You thought that
You could love it
Until it touched you
And now you just wanna stop it

Well I'm sorry
It's not likely
It was here when you got here
And it'll be here when you're not here no more

And then some days
I get lucky
I can focus and things are less shaky

And I scrape you
Off the pale moon
And I slip you
Into soft shoes

And you tap dance
To a jazz band
On a cruise ship
Near an island

And your hair's up
You wear a short dress
And a wide smile
Your movements are careless

It's a daydream
I keep having
To make the clocks move
While I'm working

Or a bad joke
I can't sit through
And I smile because I feel like I have to

But if you'd look under the table
You'd see I'm playing with my knife
I'm slicing stripes into my kneecaps

What if that's true and I'm the only one who knows it?",Tapdance

Things could be so slow
I could wait so long
And be so still

And come
And go where I want

Where my fingers find
There way there

Every night
We sleep side by side
Your hands in mine

And when you get here
It's so nice
It's just the part
Where you leave

I don't like

It's just the part

Where you leave
I don't like

Such a happy accident
A note in your sneaker
At ten in the morning
And all of my worry

That you were offended
And the catch in my breath

With rows of red roofs over warm farmer's daughters
Who've got no intention of inviting me in.
Space shines all above me so I settle myself under it.

When I wake up, I'm back in my crowed city apartment,
With some random men doing work off in the kitchen.
They're stacking mattresses up now from the ceiling down to the floor.

I hear him whistling under door.
I rush to lift him, but you all know I'm weak,
And you know that he's heavy.
There's no blood in his cheeks,

But he's smiling straight at me.
I ask the thickest of the workers,
""Would you please come and help me out?""
He comes ambling over and says,

""Sir, I love how your whistling sounds.""
So now we drag him through the kitchen to the living room
And down on the carpet.
He says, ""Son, I'm embarrassed,

But the sides of my head hurt.
I just know that I'm tired and I could surely use some rest.""
I tear a mattress down for him and I say,
""Here Dad. Sleep some on this.""

I wake for real, and it's over.

I got a sweet tooth
Sunk in a soft spot

And I found bones in the foundation that I'm just picking out now

I saw a bad sign lit up like Broadway
And I watched my head spin
And I heard my voice shake

To keep you guessing whil the shift change splits the streets,

Kevin Devine,"It's going straight to my head:
I think I'm falling in love again.
Such simple miracles have happened
Since your steady hands have come and
Stopped my unraveling.

Your fingers, built for the piano,
Work out the knots that line my back.
The stress I've stored since last December,
But now, it doesn't matter.
I've learned to leave it in my past.

And I feel good about the future,
This clarity I've never had.
You are the bounce in my step,
The burst of blood in my chest,
The prayer I've kept in my head.

You are the knock of my knees,
The swollen sound of each song
I scribble down and tear up,
Because they never match up.
You are the words I fumble for.

In the morning, 
You are the daybreak,
And I am glad.

And at night,
You are the dream
I fall asleep to have.",You Are the Daybreak
Kevin Devine,"

We're goin' out tonight my son,
So bring your flask, 
And bring your cross,
And bring your gun
And I've been borrowin' lots of cash
So you won't be needin' none
Just wear your good shoes
'Cause we're goin' out my son

And I got a car loaded up with gas
And parked right outside
I got a city map and a mission in my mind
I just need someone ridin' with me
Or a brother to my right
To keep me company 
In that big ol' car outside

'Cause I don't wanna think about the world right now
I wanna go from bar-to-bar and wash the taste clean out
And I wanna feel the way I felt 
When we were kids messin' around
Before I thought about the world I got to now

But don't go feelin' all stuck 
And shamed for yr damned ol' dad
'Cause I've seen troubles 
That could kill ten stronger men
It's just that all this weight from la-la-livin's
Been catchin' fire in my hands
Well, fuck this town son, 
I wanna make 'em crawl again

And you tell your lady
Not to leave on that light
You tell her not to sit up
Worryin' all goddamn night
But if she's awake when you crawl home
You just shut your mouth and smile nice
You say ''Baby, I'm tired. 
Can we please turn off those lights?''
You say ''Baby, I'm tired.
I just wanna shut off all those lights.''",Yr Damned Ol' Dad
Kevin Devine,"I found you grieving in the grass
Sky blood water color blue
You seem so simple sure and sad
So I sat down to grieve with you
You raised your hand to shield your eyes
I shifted left to block the sun
You crossed your legs and cleared your throat
I waited for you words to come
But they slept soundly in your chest
They never made it past your tongue
So we sat silently and still
We thought about the things wed done
And all the people that we loved
And all the people that we wronged
I watched the years flash through your face
Locked my anger in your lungs
So every breath stung more and more
A wave of wips across my spine
A billion bees trapped in my chest
Nails on chalkboard every time
'Til I watched your fingers sneak towards mine
I heard your breath go thing and short
I tucked your hair behind your ears
And watched your eyes dart back and forth
I sucked your lip and bit your neck
The trees were shaking at their roots
My angry arms fell cool and calm
My cotton mouth was well with you
So we lay glowing in the grass
To watch the sun swamp with the moon
Trade our future for our past

Dead end friends that make your stomach shake 
While your hissing head barrels down that blackened lane
Alone at last to figure how you got this way
Alone at last to figure how you got this way

Hey hey, hear its back break
So I can never tell night from day

Kevin Devine,"Forty million refugees with no place on this earth to call there home
One for every aimless graduate with nothing else to show for it but loans 
And those of us who make our mark use someone else's blood
Our western stain won't wash away, it won't vanish in the flood
It seeps deeper through each hurricane and tidal wave and war
Oh woah oh oh
We want everything we see and once it's gone we just want more

Atlas had those shoulders, we've got Ambien and Jameson's and blow
To bind us in a bubble and keep the newsprint nightmare distant and remote 
But when we wake in gulitines and pitch our screaming fits
When the govenor strikes up the band and gags our parted lips
When the worst case shows up dressed and dazzling, ready for the ball
Oh woah oh oh
But that bubbles bound to burst and what a tragic way to fall

The tabloids tell us hate
The rat who strikes those subways closed and put's you out
Forget those fifty hour tunnel weeks
Inhaling steel dust poison through his mouth
Well if he don't deserve a pension it makes his family feel secure
If we're now so dissconected it's our reflections we ignore
And if our constant choice is skimming past the writing on the wall
Oh woah oh oh
Then I'm sad to say we're lost and I'm embarrassed for us all

So most days I can't put to rest the burning city smoking in my mind
And I play and pretend the principles are nothin' more than actors runnin' lines
And I stumble through a movie set where tourtered victims laugh
And embedded journalists who juggle knives and daggered glass
While they entertain a mob of heads of state and CEO's
Oh woah oh oh
I stagger past anarchist extras through saloon doors painted gold 

So I turn and I see Uncle Sam outside a wardroube ready for a shoot
So I walk right up and talk to him, I tell him that I'm scared and I'm confused
And while they test the cameras out and get the lighting right
While the catering fills coffee cups and carves up apple pie
And while the stylists trim his beard and straighten those clothes
Oh woah oh oh
I ask his empires what made him drive us straight to hell
And as my daydream ends, he stands ashamed, a shocked and shattered shell
But there's never any answer for my starving tongue to tell

His arrows and stones

While the father on the barstool, dropped off by his carpool, is playing a familiar role:

The raging world has spooked him scared, and he don't want her lost out there.
So now it's later than it needs to be

Against everything he believes

Set my pen back down
It's still me, still me

And I'm grabbing at a feeling now
That I can't ever name

They look like christmas lights she'd hang in her apartment

But my eyes go fuzzy and start painting shapes all over the movie I'm watching
And they mix and match my present with my past
But the colors are crisp and I press to hard so ink soaks straight through the back

Yea I gotta start to live, to live that way
So less yesterday, and more today

Of a stranger today
And my heart leapt, my heart leapt 
I saw the sickle of your dimple 
Slice the side of her face 
And my heart leapt, my heart leapt

For our place on the train

Kabuki makeup, a labret ring 
I kept out of her way
You're not that actress playing dress-up 
On the subway today
So my heart keeps leapin' on

On my 4-track today
But my tongue tied, my tongue tied
I couldn't figure how to fit you 
On the spin and the tape
See, my tongue tied, my tongue tied 

The words are small and insignificant,
Confused and cliche
I saw my promise and potential 
Through my guilt and my shame
I couldn't catch that in a couplet 
On my best goddamn day 
My tied tongue tumbles on

Shake and shiver 
And laugh like cursing kids

Fit everytime we kiss

Since my feet first touched the ground
And I'm kicking like a kid

I slide step to my right
But it nails me every time
And I'm finished pulling fits

With a splitting headache
And sore bloodshot eyes

And I've known trouble all my life
And I'm sick of asking why

These days my hangman's hunger makes my gut kick
My sleeping mind, could map it blind
A flask, a key, a bag, a fifth
I try to will myself away
While shouting habits plead their case

My beggar's brain can't compromise
I splash cold water, I draw the curtains, I stay inside

And I can't say that it's a sickness, more like a stranger I ask in
And later realize, was a strangler
Slipping nooses in my den
But I was lonely so I asked him, ""Would you tie that one on me?""
It wasn't his fault, I was eager, and I was weak

So as I inch towards resolution
Yea I'm not sure which life feels right
A narrow noose or the wading water
The hanging head, sore open eyes
I know my brother he went one way
And at the fork I heard him say
""Don't you follow, don't go making my mistakes""
And I realized what he meant

I watched the future start

I prayed for providence
God said, don't pray no more

I faced the devil's day

A flaming ferris wheel
Spun where the sun used to be

I watched it's buckets dip and dance
I saw a couple making love lock hands
They were pushing for abandon and the answers it could bring
90 million miles from the graveyard growing over everything

I saw my lover chased
Through fields of sugarcane
She clutched her belly close
And whispered, ""keep us safe""
They ground her down to dust
No more miracles today

I dreamt myself awake
In a resort hotel
Above a golden coast
Beside my Southern belle
We heard the sea reborn
In each singing shell

And every coughing car
And every coiled snake
And every shrieking star
And every burning stake
Dissolved to atmosphere
All of everything, erased

I spread into a distant hum
I droned along with everyone
And the earth grew green and nursed herself to what she used to be

See, that's Mr. Murphy, my leathery brave
He's whimpering ""Taps"" now, for his plank-walk grade

I've never been a joiner, no, I've quit every team I've been on

Now I'm crying in my coffee, that's not sea salt in my eyes
'Cause me and Murphy, we have been through it, and I hate watching him die

So I wait for my wisdom, like I wait for my wife
Like I wait for a story, helps me wait out the night

Like when I was an archer, but I couldn't shoot straight
I broke all of ma's windows, I poked holes through her drapes

And I laugh to myself, but I can't tell you why
The hung-over sun, sneaks back in the sky

But Murphy went peaceful, he went decent and right
At least better than I will, when it's my turn to die

And I wear his collar on my wrist
And I bury him down at the beach

No crying, no coffin, just a body and a hole
No praying, no singing, no saving any souls

The only thing I'm saving, yeah
Is a bone inside a bowl",Murphy's Song
Kevin Devine,"You drag your tiger's paw across
Your chapped and cracking lips
And open up a crimson slur
You spread each time you kiss

The broken boy you bargain with
To turn back to the man
That you fell in love with once
But never saw again
Is he in there? Do you think he drowned to death?
Well it's his decision to show his face again

You grind your tired teeth
And curse the day that you were born
To a sunken line of Irish wives a million miles long
Devoted to the suffering they're certain they deserve
A husband's a cross to bear
Worry lines and a silver string of hair
Come too early, come to steal your sainted youth
Well it's your decision to stay or else to move

And I'm not a man of faith, no gospel oak for me
But you wear a crucifix to broadcast your beliefs
And the god I've read about can't go where he's not asked to go

So you've got a choice to make
Shut him out, save yourself, or sit and wait
But you're waiting on a man who will not move
So you must move for him and do what he can't do

'Cause it's worth it, that's the one life you can change
And I'm sorry sister, but it has to end this way
Yeah, it's scary sister, but tomorrow's just too late

Kevin Devine,"Your husband
He drinks like a writer
But he writes like a banker
I hope his pens all run dry

You watch him from your cave in the corner
Full moon eyes flame and flicker
The wild way that I like

From my part
I pretend I don't notice
Dumb friend you're a poet
And I could do this all night

And I'll stay like that
Hands locked in my lap
What I want jailed up in my mind
Until I slide to sleep
Where you're waitin' for me
And we do what we want to
And shut ourselves off for the night

Til morning barrels in like a brides maid
Drunk and desperate for her day
Drags me out picks a fight

And I see I'm alone here
Picture frames and a hot plate
Stubborn sun spites the hallways
Paint chips blink yellow white

And I'm stretching in the act of forgetting
Bear teeth and blood letting
Signals crossed half my life

And the local grown
Sees your notes towards my home
Dreaming fits as we crawl underground
And you're shedding skin
So I keep what I can
Yeah I fill up my pockets
And stuff all that's left in my mouth

Now you are a part of me

Kevin Devine,"Walked in the world, became a Catholic
Their oil and their guilt
Somewhere in high school switched to atheist
Your anger and your will
Turned twenty five freaked out by everything
The bodies piled up
Fled to your mind when they stopped listening
And said, enoughs enough.

What if it's all just jokes?
Casper, The Holy Ghost
What if it's all just stones you get to throw?

And every single time that you opened your mouth
Someone else's lies came tumbling out
Parading as the truth in a cap and a gown
A graduated curse that you cast to the ground

To settle your debts you took a dozen steps
Or started on the path
Kept falling off when faced with righteousness
You couldn't work the math
God in the wood, the words, the coffee pot
It wasn't adding up
At war with yourself, afraid of everyone
You said, enoughs enough.

How could you ever know?
What if you said you don't?
What if you cleared your throat and let it go?

So every single time that you opened your mouth
Something like the truth came struggling out
A picture of the past you kept whittling down
To a version of yourself you could follow around

So what if the end just ends?
It's worthless to worry, then
To wrestle yourself to death again and again

Now every single time that you open your mouth
Give yourself a breath while you're working it out
The answer's in between all the concrete and clouds
It's anywhere you want
Yeah, it's next to you now?",Between The Concrete And Clouds
Kevin Devine,"Neurotic intellectual
Emotionally unavailable
You're everything you think you should be
But the truth is unavoidable
And every choice intentional
Darling, I don't mean to be mean
But you're see-through as see-through can be
And when the party ends, you're sweating in sheets

The city has left you alone
You cycle on fast-forward through
The strangers in your phone
And you re-record your voice mail
Find that perfect hollow tone:
""Hey, you've reached me, but what does that mean?
I don't know.""

So run your risk and play your part
Hide away your hardened heart
And tuck yourself back into your shell
But is all that detached irony
That finely tuned delivery
Hurting more than it's ever helped?
Are you fooling anyone but yourself?
Well, you're the only one who can tell

Because the city has left you alone
In a Chelsea bar at closing time
Too wired to go home
When a street shark with a songbird rap
And a repertory brogue
Slurs, c'mon love. There ain't no secret code.
Are you thinking what I'm thinkin', yes or no?
Leave the mourning for the mornin', love. Let's go.

You're acting out the dead end of a theme
A cliche in a roundabout
Another person's dream
It makes romantic copy but it's not a life to lead

So roll your eyes and suck on your teeth
No, you don't need to prove nothin' to me
But you're the only one who knows what you need

With a car service on hold

But isn't waiting getting old?

Kevin Devine,"Christ on the cross, no more room, just slide off
Meet on the wire, no more lines, can?t climb higher

So from your new plateau you writhe and wait,
For something real to shake your bones,
To turn you back into a person

You sublet the space, cut your costs, flipped off fate
And watched while she packed, cried and cried, but no ""come back""

You figured you could sit around and wait,
For love this real to just pop up,
To fall from trees, to ride on rainstorms

Convinced it was worth it, you swore it was worth it
You said it was worth it through the first hit

The basement brokering and side bets
The puzzle pieces in the tool shed

I know you can build it cause I built it

Stripped his pride away but he found more

Kevin Drew,"Well, every time they took me to the rise of your bed
You know what kind of doing at the top of your head
But all the little words that came down like a spider
Trickle through the morpheme try to make them cry

I'm in respect to suggest that we're through
You don't know I could live without you if you do
But tell me that the temperature's rising in your head
Tell me that the blood is not to be mislead

All of these little boys coming through the cracks
Trying to pick up these worms on the side
I could see the broken fences lying down in the yard
Green like your mom instead that never was retired

I know, I know, I know soon
All the things you thought about what you could do
When the clouds separated, in comes the sun
Heard it through a song that a girl once sung

She's the reason why I'm trying to make it alright
Trying to drive through, girl, wish it tonight
Rolling on the side with the moon in my hand
Trying to be a stereotype with a friend

But my love is gone and my God is low
That's why I'm doing all the things of the above
Don't you expect to make a phone call tonight
Treat me like a motherfucker who is right

Every time a creature comes into my past
I know you should snigger about things that we laughed
How I've got a cause that never met a man
Took a talk to him and tried to make him me friend

But you can see that I'm just coming out through the glass
Everyone speaks about something the past took
But I came beside with it, I could believe
Take me to your bed and show me some trees

But I can bet a fuck, will do the whole
Try to tell you that there's nowhere to roam
You're like a brother who thinks I won't care
I'm ready to tell you that you are not mislead

The crows that fly, we'll try not to find

When we met, I searched for a better night
Not the first or last to wait, wait behind
A fire's what I leave with mirrors who decide
I crush the kiss and dream of you and I
And that's all I know

You can run but you can never ever live a life,
You stay and talk about your mother's favorite life

I got that shit, I got them beats that'll make you lose control 

Step up in the club, so fresh and clean 
Not the outcast that they label me 
I'm rolling with a team, that roll so deep 
We in and out the club everyday of the week 
And I make them hits, when the beat drop 
That's when you here me say say hold up, stop 

Let me take you back to 5o'clock 
When I roll the lamborghini off the block 
But not before I made them chop the top 
And throw some 20 shoe's, oh that's hot 

Hit Nastros For a bite to eat 
No tuxedo 'cause they reconize me 
Her lifestyle, the rich living, the fast cars 
Don't hate 'cause I'm a superstar and I married a superstar 
Never come between us no matter who you are, c'mon

So rich, that I tattoo the dice on my wrist 
And my girl too, It's no coincidence that SRT got all black tints 
I've never been a digger but I rock 'em nuggets 
One earing cost more than your budget 
I ain't here to brag I'm just here to pop tags 
My ferrari cost more than your lil S-class 
Look man I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket 
It don't matter what you blow, boy you can't match it 
40 grand I take the whole crew to Miami 
Then we pop Crys off like they won Grammy's 
I take care of my own, that's my family

We got 'em on this one due

And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do

When the pen hits the pad
It's in the left hand
Every single word is worth thirty grand
Or maybe more
Don't think they understand
How much cake the pancake man had
So heavy like weight
Moving upstate
Care for my rhyme
Like the crime rate
I flick with your boy
The prince of the bay
Sit back, day to day
Got two back packs
Resno on one
LA in other
Whilst I'm holding my sons
As I march through the valley of the shadow of death
Dark hair on my chest
Wife on my left
Let's go

And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do

That's how I'ma ride
For my family I'd die
Bet you're all thinking
I'm that guy
Don't care about you
'Cause I'm the truth
I ball like Kobe
Shooting hoops
Up in the roof
Been the million dollar corporation
Call me maloof
Like I said once before
I'm the truth
Hollywood can't catch me
But they got you
Nothing fake round here
I'm the realest do
Haters feel us too
I'm in and out the groove
Every word out my mouth
Make headline news
I'm the best, I rule
Come test my tools
You do so square
Get my slang out manuals, ha

And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do

And they say I'm a little crazy
But they don't even know you, baby
So they base all their the accusations
On what they really don't know
So tired of all the speculation
Fed up of negative fabrications
You say just have a little patience
But they are driving me crazy

Never been a surfer
But my chang hang loose
Got so much flavour
Like 2Pac juice
Got dudes wishing you're in my shoes
I'm a rockstar baby
I do what I wanna do
Tough pack
My crew will come and clobber you
Let the pope come out
And watch it swallow you
Not a pretty boy
But I look like a model do
Not a gangster
But in my life, yeah I've fought a few
Hit the hustle tight now it look
Like I'm robbing you
All yours flys
Watch how I swatted you
Better think twice how you come at me
I'm a godfather now
I'm about my family, yeah

And they say
I'm crazy
For loving you
For feeling you
And maybe
I'm a little crazy
But they don't know
All the things you do

Sittin' in the middle of a crippled kitchen table barely standing up from where I kicked it once.
It ain't pretty enough to make up for me messin' up the only love a man could ever need
She shines forgiveness from her patient eyes
I don't see what they see in me

Somethin' I can wrap my heart and hands around
First thing I wanna hold when I get home
Been savin' up for it all week long

Times are lean and money's tight
A man's got to prioritize
I've learned how to sacrifice

I'm gonna drive a little less, walk a little more
Save a little bread at the grocery store
Turn down the heat till I can see my breath
Throw another blanket on that ole brass bed
Sell my golf clubs, half my clothes
Sign in the yard says, ""Everything goes""
No more roses for my honey
But I ain't givin' up my beer money

When I'm a six pack shy of next month's rent
I just pop a top and wonder where it went
Down to four strings on my guitar
Sellin' off my truck part by part

Stretch a dollar, squeeze a dime
Pinchin' pennies; hell, that's fine
Ain't nothin' cuttin' into my beer time

I'm gonna drive a little less, walk a little more
Save a little bread at the grocery store
Turn down the heat till I can see my breath
Throw another blanket on that ole brass bed
Sell my golf clubs, half my clothes

But I ain't givin' up my beer money

There's enough coupons in the paper
Enough cans at the end of the month

I close my eyes and all I see is a cloud of señoritas dancin' round me
I don't think I'm losing my mind
But I'm thinking maybe, I might be borderline crazy

Well I drove past my ex going in to work today
And my mind, once again drifted to Monterey
I hear mariachi bands playin' in my head

Just know I landed face first in the gravel
Got up and kicked him in the pork-n-beans
Dusted off and then, I ran right back in 'cuz
I was just there to drink
I was just minding my own business
Can I get a witness
I was just partyin on, climbed up on the bar to sing my song
Jumped off and surfed across the crowd
Then the big bad bouncer threw me out
I was just there to drink
I was just minding my own business
Can I get a witness
I was just partyin on
Swear I wasn't doin nothin wrong
Just kissed another waitress on the mouth
Jumped off the bar, surfed across crowd
If I wadn't busy drinkin' woulda taken him down
But the big bad bouncer threw me out
""He better be glad I was in a good mood""
""Yeah I'll let it slide this time""

Kevin Fowler,"It's a single star wavin', so proud and tall
It's the smell of gun powder on the Alamo walls
A red Corpus sunset, hill country bluebonnets
Brisket at Cooper's, Joe T's enchiladas
It's floatin' the Frío, cold beer in hand
It's a couple two steppin to a twin fiddle band
It's a Saturday rodeo, Friday night lights, the prettiest girls you ever seen in your life

For those who
The mud on the Brazos and Red Rivers run through our blood
Let the world know
We'll fight to the death, for the land and the people we love
Gather around friends
It's time for a toast, let us raise up a cold one together
To Texas forever
From the pines to the mountains
The coast to the Plains
There's a pride down inside us, that's hard to explain
If ever you were one, then always you'll be
You may wander this world, but your heart never leaves
All these cowboys still saddle their horses to ride
Out here there's just some things that won't ever die
Like a ghost in the alley of some 6th St bar
You can still hear the ringin' of Stevie's guitar

Gums hurting from a old bullet
In front the toilet while hunched over
Puking all of my insides
Stab wounds from a old friend
Well at that time we were close friends
They said I killed him in cold blood
We wrestled for the gun but the gun went off
He up’d the pistol looked him dead in his eyes
I’ve been ready to die so nigga do it

I’m serious too nigga, really do it

Just know that what you do a bitch
Go do what you want to
Use a renegade
The worst thing you can get in a nigga hard bitch
Is rejection
And the hoes love attention
You ain't got to have a pussy to be a hoe
A hoe is just somebody that want attention from another man

I hurt so much in the last month
Live everyday like it's your last one
Can't trust nobody
I've been betrayed by everybody around
Cracking jokes I don't laugh much
For help I never could ask much
If I'm down an out I get passed up
No one there to be found

This life is like a rodeo
Up and down emotional roller coaster
Problem solver, ain't hard to cope with
But it's hard to follow rules, I'm the culprit
Easy to talk but its hard to listen
But the goal I'm chasing ain't hard to picture
Hurt to see every car I wanted
But behind the wheel I ain't the person in it
The chick I wanted, wanted someone popular
And I ain't that popular (whats that?)
But now I'm so high, you gon' need binoculars

Introverts can't be too talkative
Now as my heart place all of it
Usually I wear frowns
Ain't no sense in my straight pretending
In a room full of people, I pays attention
Steak for dinner, that we provided
Made money in the slum that the street provided
Behind my door
Clutch heat beside it
Out of line, I was taught let it eat somebody
Put the sleeper silence
Retreat from by me
If it ain't no property shouldn't leave ?
Certain things about it won't change
The world ain't able to see bout that

Pockets filled with Franks

Kevin Gates,"Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you seeking comfort in depressed times
This is a depressed time
Luca Brasi!

Every rapper in the game'll say they sold cocaine
Never went to jail was
Never on no chain
Always throwing crosses that's what lil' hoes get
Claim to be a boss but you a lil' broke bitch,
Reason you alive thank the niggas you run wit,
I was in a cell witchu and you ain't run shit,
Told me put my shoes on,
But you ain't scratch
I wreck hall and jack off and then was so laid back
For niggas you would make calls,
Don't that sound like draft
When I call a bitch in love she get here oh so fast,
Fucking right I read my bible, I believe in God,
Yeah you punched me in my shit but you did not hit hard (laughs)

I have respect for every man that demand your respect,
Nigga still alive, he lying if he said he checked me
Rather stand alone before I pull a nigga dick,
All you pussy rappers just be pulling niggas dick (ya bitch)

Behind my name I'm standing tall and will die any day,
As I grew wise I thought that I would put that foolish pride away,
If you cross can't take a loss, I can't walk away (I can't)
There's no way in hell I'd ever let you walk away

R-E-S-P-E-C-T this heat, I keep that Glock with me
Caught two pistol charges still got my L's and reciprocity
Never be a celebrity, all this beef where the broccoli
I'm obviously not wrapped to tightly, probably better off offing me
A nigga better watch how he talk to me, like how I watch how I talk on my cell
Don't answer my phone from rap niggas, I get calls way more often from jail (hello)
Swear it was so hot out on my block we all thought it was hell
On the L's, sippin' syrup tryna mend this broken heart from all the betrayal
Sold it before it got off the scale, re-up and do it again
Shot it out so many times, got to see who was truly my friends
I was one deep in deep thought
Thinking everybody tryna con or cross me
It's getting hard to be humble tryna get this bad karma off me
Starlito!

I have respect for every man that demand your respect,
Nigga still alive, He lying if he said he checked me
Rather stand alone before I pull a nigga dick,

As I grew wise I thought that I would put that foolish pride away,
If you cross can't take a loss, I can't walk away (I can't)
There's no way in hell I'd ever let you walk away

I just aim the Smithn' 22 and win me 14-6
If I lost you with the multiple you don't know shit
16 through 52's you got you 4 bricks
But it probably was in vein, Cause you won't score shit
Brah talk about me bad, I'm like not my boy
When I got his bitch pregnant bet it broke his heart
Gone ahead and get some get back or fuck my bitch
I'll let you in on a lil' secret nigga she not shit,
First ole' lady crushed my feelings, I ain't been hurt since
Whole family full of gangstas and we both know this,
If a sucker run up on me he can get bent up,

Am I wrong for showing interest in these women surrounding
I'mma straight dick her down and go
No time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time
I done been down this road
Strictly need my c-notes, can you keep up with my lingo
Some'll say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin' to win, think I made again
Though many ladies pretend, hoping this ain't what it is
This business I'm in, may make me taking a beating
Would you still be my friend, when I'm lonely love
Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one on the phone, but us
Someone who strong when it's rough, someone who won't give up
Ain't no wasting time, hustle every night
Promise everything is alright

People changing on me, I am so sick of the masquerades
Grew up poor, had no dishes, ate off paper plates
I'm taking aim, brought up in this life I know
Baby you a rider and I love when you ride it slow
Motion for me girl
Arch it to the ceiling, now bend over for me girl
Pulling on your hair, while I'm gripping on your ass
When I kill it from the back, know you feel it in your back
Late night screaming, all of the right reasons
Touching, teasing, blowing it might please
Make it bite back, I love when it bite me
Saying take some out, I know what it might be
When your body go to shaking, you're raising your right knee
Bit the pillow with your teeth, I know what it might mean
I'mma keep going, I know that the light green
Can't stay still, I'm stroking the right thing
Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed
Don't tell me the spot, I'mma find it instead
Big fine muthafucka, she a dime with the head
Just got a text, never mind what it said
IPhone ringing, I decline with a fret
Which color should I press, lime or the red
Decline or accept, next line never read
Minus the time and the time been the best
Told her what it was first time that we met
But she cry and get upset every time that I left

Or you gonna lay on top of it

Just got the word from above, placing my heart in this message
Evil is after your soul, people smart with deceptions
Keep the sharp observation, allowing no infiltration
Of those you let in your circle
They get the chance, they gon' hurt you
They be counting your pockets, you can tell by they comments
Incident with my car, my nigga wanted to drive it
I told him no, he flashed out, texting my phone talking violent
And told me put him in a song and he was catchin a body
God protected my body, I fear no nigga breathin
I feel like David and Goliath, a hungry pack of hyaenas
Showing they teeth when I'm eating
Do it look like I'm cheesing?
Took my lick like a man
Then came home to the streets
No defeat!

When everyone's around I bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
They say they love you and that for you they do anything
You find it awkward that their eyes don't say the same thing
Changing lately, beware of smiling faces
Entangling, betraying, beware of smiling faces

These murders weigh on my conscious as I take too many showers
I need a woman to hold me, help me forget all my problems
It 5 a.m in Toronto, she down here for college
She says a major psychology would both into astrology
This moscato was sweet, inhaling sticks of this broccoli
Hard to sleep on the side of me, seem too much is bothering me
Memories haunting me, jumping up out my sleep
She might say ""Babe it's ok"" - then put me straight back to sleep
I do this three of four times, my life on constant repeat
Reason I can't quit syrup, my anxiety be fucking with me
Every bitch I'm with, find out I ain't shit
After three weeks of just fucking with me
Its a fucked up feeling when you looking in the mirror
And everybody in the mirror pretending they fucking with me
Who fucking with me?!

Real street, nigga, none of that made up
Lay you on your back with both legs up
Eat the dick with a lot of spit
Sixty-nine, we can try again
Love the way you smell love to feel your skin
Hands together, I'mma hold them back
Put the head in, and I throw it back
Arch you all the way to the ceiling
Get your booty licked while you make it clap
Uh, nasty! A lot of tattoos get at me
Face underneath your waist
While my fingers scratching your scalp
You keep squirming all on my couch
You left nipple all in my mouth!
Ask them hoes about me, I kill pussy
I know you know what's that about!

Got his bourbon I was happy for him

Ain't had sex in a long while but after this she'll think about me for a long time.

Conversations in the dark emotions get exposed 
Sayin' whatever talked about no one should ever know
Body exotic like them models in the videos treating the dick 
Just like a stripper when she on the pole.

While gambling the point we seen the money go
Touching me gently sayin' she never wanna let it go

Breakfast, brunch and checkin' up linen made when mess it up 
Mike Tyson fightin' with a lotta bitin'

Eat pussy up yeah appetizer, looks appetizing like excitement, 
She like to ride showed the pipe and she got on top like a motorcycle, 
I'm a street nigga pull hair, in the projects 
I'm good there fuck with'chu that's sayin' something any other bitch could have, 
Suck toes tongue in between what we have nothing come between, 
In and out of this pressure (sexin') smoke detector (no smoke detected) 
Jumpin' hard and know she felt it, makin' faces I'm strokin' heavy 
My song waiting bumpin' loud on repeat, seem the sex is always greater 
Hit the loud hit the lean speakin' with a soft tongue then know we all lost

A lot is countin' on ya
Your women sidin' with ya partners, why they plottin' on ya?
We might never understand, no one's there to hold your hand
Even heaven would agree sometimes, how this road gets
Losin' focus
Can't depend on them, why do they depend on me?
They was all I had, I mean what made 'em go pretend on me?
Spirit of the sermon, discernin' moments I see shit
Can't look me in the eyes then it's somethin' you don't agree with

Perhaps I'm too quick off the draw from how I deal with altercations
From where gangsters only talk cocaine, it ain't no other language
Awkward interviews discussin' my inner views on life itself
Figure me pretentious, evading mischief by writing hymns
Labels shown interest, no showers are showin' interest
Both old ladies show resentment, resented my show of interest
Moved out from my momma detached garage and a small apartment
Shut the door or shut the fuck up, we fussin', we always arguin'
It sucks we always arguin', but she started it
Moms believe, I grew up on the farm with no understandin'
Kevin's stupid, tell him anything, he won't understand it
Stupid ass Kevin, anything, he won't understand it

Ain't no VIP, got nook in front, pockets got the mumps
Money come in clumps, what I clutch might knock out your lung
Keep that on the tuck, it go KKK if you uh
Got two people livin' in me, one the realest one a killer
Luca Brasi, he a sinner, Kevin trynna be a Christian
Seems life is less fulfilling when livin' is unattended
Performin' rituals to whatever God that'll listen
Had a lot of prayers answered, ain't had to sit in no buildin'

Kevin Gates,"As a wise man that think if I possess the game in my mind
The reason I wear shades you can't see the pain in my eyes

In the rain storm in the blizzard, expressing all of my feelings
Pause, never took me serious, naw, mama never wanna listen
Stomach hurting my pockets empty how dare a nigga wanna tempt me
In the dark room all prayed out, I ain't never sat in no Bentley
Hustle hard in the alley way by Ms. Cita house I'm getting it
Wrecked my car Chris laughed at me, like I ain't supposed to remember
Wish Wig was still living, wish Shrimp was still living
Wish Joe was still living
Look at Chris how he tripping
Young Troll just hit the phone
But he don't keep it a thousand,
Ray Vicks just jacked him, and he ain't even see bout that
Now he telling me 'bout that
Seem to me he ain't 'bout that, nigga let me get a thrill juice
You don't have it now, but you gone have it later
My face card worth a hundred bands
Game recognize game baby, my lil brother lil Terrance Hines
I'd die for him and go to war behind him
Real niggas, all around me, bitch niggas ain't round me
Talkin Massachusetts exclusive, somebody bring it back
Cocaine made me smile but I cried
Ain't think my team a rat
Stroke know I love em
But nigga around could say fuck me
How that go when I fuck with nigga, ain't nobody gone fuck with em
In the neighborhood that I grew up in
They call it the southside, everybody house overcrowded
Forcing them to hang outside, my lil cousin Corey, hustle hard in fruits town
On the boulevard with the roof open like damn Fed what I do now
Me and Bees and Rodney, ice cup and it's muddy
You don't like me then fuck you
Probably dap me off and say fuck me
God forgive me next nigga play with me
I'll probably kill they mother
Make the funeral you in trouble
A lot of guns out and they bustin'
Pussy rapper talking shit on Twitter
But out in public it's nothing
Discussion had and I bump em
If looks could kill, I would've been dead
Bitch I'm with give real head
But I don't trust her that much
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck

Bitches all on my dick (zip)
Only God know my struggle

Run up on me nigga I'm with it
Put a slug in one of you niggas
Only God know my struggle
Had it hard so I hustle
And everybody 'round me say
I don't give a fuck a bout nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
I don't give a fuck about nothin'

Most likely I'm too intelligent
They say cuts heal, not much here
You forget about it or you get around it
Can't forget about it, then you kill about it
I'm a ordained street minister
Read the bible, but a finish ya
Still have trouble with letting go
That ain't my ho, I just thought it was
My friends laughed when I kissed on her
Shoulda pulled my dick out and pissed on em
My family on fire wouldn't piss on em
Cold world, don't quit on me
Grind hard, get rich on em
Whatever you do just stack paper
My lil cousin Chief just called my phone, and I'm like what's the problem
""Heard about Lil Mocha? Nigga tried him and Lil Mocha shot him""
Bitch I'm going hard
It ain't no stopping, do that for the bottom
Everybody watching, Gates a great and he just made it out
Everything I make from profit
God I promise, I'll invest in houses
Just give me another chance at life
Put me back in bounce
Went to jail, already had my strips
Ain't no backing down
Shawty Spit Stacckz was in the cell with me
I'm laughing loud
This for all of you that hated
Panamaras backing out

I was chillin' in a Ihop, overheard a conversation
Both of them niggas killas, one of em was Michael Caden
Big brother The Jason
I went to school with him
His brother got killed, so now he keep a tool with him
Live around the corner from his two daughters, no father
That's when the waitress came over like,
""May I take your order?""
Give me the breakfast sample
Orange juice and a Coke
That nigga looked at me and nodded
He said I never spoke
Like what the fuck them niggas lookin' at
That's what I heard the other say
Looked a mean muggin' way
Nigga turned the other way
Had to turn deaf ear, Satan was in my left ear
Like go and council, you a nigga nobody could see you
Show them niggas that you real
Nobody could be you
I walked over and asked him
You wan take it off your shoulder?
Hand checkin' him in his face
Tellin' him I'm a soldier
I ain't no fucking drug lord
I ain't the type to try to be
Ten years of aggression, you don't wanna see that out of me
Jagged ass Smith and Wesson
Bangin' Sangin' I gotta be
That nigga, that nigga
All started on a Tuesday afternoon, me and my bitch got into it
Unnecessary fools, just toolin', her hair ruined
Found out from another chick
Livin' out of town
In an upstairs apartment, that was three corners down
Click spot for my round
Jeff used to scope pounds
Tanya ran into me, her and Amber they ran into me
Me and Tanya remained cool
Amber's man was pussy
He ran to the block, and sent some niggas from another hood
They came back, and black masked up
Just like I knew they would
Runnin' out there buckin' loud
Niggas only laughed at ya
Hard not to bang when you got bitch niggas attacking ya
Up to 40 calibre, oncoming passenger
Scaffold through the tourist section
Stole all the traffica
See him with his clique
He used to mug, but never buck with them
Used to keep a smirk because my old lady was fucking him
Ain't no need to get mad
I'm thinking I ain't never fuck with him
Hit one of my niggas up, we bargained on his brain
Fucking with my little brother, who frequently snort the cain
Dapped him down as I passed him
What's hannin', where's Twerked em?
Back was turnt the whole time
Little brother ran up and murked him
Issued him two to the dome
And worked him with the chrome
And to this day, I can say
I set him up, and he's gone
Three months prior
I'm downtown, meeting Lisa McBoyd
I'm in town handling business for Floyd
He couldn't make it, I'm a take it by myself
I'm awaiting a vacation
Three bricks going to Kurt, coming home from Las Vegas
On the phone with Joe, finishing a conversation
That say I was gonna be off, cause he was at a graduation.
Well shit, I'm on my way out of state to meet Mason
He told me to be safe and any problems, I could page him
Jeff sitting patient in a vacant location
Not knowing that we were stopping in another metropolitan
Tanya texts Jeff, still waiting, replied obviously
""Hope your cousin Kevin ain't fake, and he ain't jivin' me,
Or tryin'a get me up to the Jake's plotting on robbin me""
Tanya said ""Kevin's my cousin, he wouldn't lie to me, whenever y'all had talked,
He was right here on the side of me, they in the real estate and probably lookin'
At property.""

Murder rap, we beat it 2am in two seaters
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to god, somebody please pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins,
Just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate
But feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys,
Who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop
You jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles

Itching for them chickens, them idiots must don't love life

Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint, while under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up

Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon be alright
Cookin' soft and sellin' hard while under neon lights

Grown in the Mafia, we poppin' in climate with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink and that's what I believe
Exploring desires the moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She grippin the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now that its inside of it, hollerin' louder she get it with speed
This is sweet, they say Diamonds Are Forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out for real, I'm for real
Cling on, got the theme song on my ringtone, wanna beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan out of hand, you scared? Bout to tell him
I'll catch em, I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July out there
And they say Diamonds Are Forever, I'm for real, I'm for real
From start to finish go call December, sayin' life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, GO now start ya engine, got a 90 day run, we talking different.
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings, with an understanding

Holla game over
You tripping hard you ain't sober on
Banana boats how we came over
Designer stores, Michael Kors
No plain clothes without our names on
Your right wrist got my name on it
I'd be lying if I said I ain't lonely
That nigga dead we ain't homies
My pain growing, that thang on me
Cocaine rover, mean range rover,
Swang corners, put aim on 'em
Kuh kuh and bang on 'em,
Leave brains on 'em and stains on 'em
Get three grams of my main smoker
This game cold but I stayed focused
Bread winner chain on the head of the lane
He was here but he ain't we steady rolling

Like crackheads losing their teeth
Blew the national keep harassing could shoot for me,
Drew your name in class
Professor asked is this a new degree
Profusely in pursuit of in something you
Reminded me of us society
Feel 'em slipping from sanity,
Don't eat enough
I'm rude no longer speak as much
Frequent find the reasons
Niggas stepping on my sneakers
Got me steaming, I should beat 'em up
Or get beat up and say somebody made ugly

So disgusted seeing couples coupled up in public hugging
Huffing puffing phone reluctant
You most likely call it stubborn

Six weeks ago I just purchased a farm
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash

Why the fuck is you standing
Over there seeking a handout I'm not finna hand it (goddammit)
Tattoos on my neck that read Kayla and Brandon
My nephew was born premature
I prayed from em', everyday for em'
He'll smile at me make a face for em'
My auntie say thanks which I couldn't believe
And I act as if that don't exist
Too much respect for to call you a bitch
All praise go to heaven your god don't exist
Love everything and everybody
Black sheeps scum of the earth
With popular people I don't fit
They was stupid they focus on bullshit
Now the whips they be driving is bullshit
Yo pastor lie to you right from the pulpit
Go hard or starve
No wait on God
Give him your money? That's bullshit
Full clips and a firearm
Put it in a ho name so I buy it for 'em
Pockets was slim as a diet form
Good dope sell itself wanna try it for 'em?
Smoke out hotel rooms and set off the fire alarm
Bwa start a riot for 'em
I don't get tired, what you tired of?
Call what's her name say she tied up
My mind going negative fuck your perspective
These interviews really got pussy
All 'em make gossip just like a woman

Back against the wall feeling boxed in
Obnoxious, I been labeled
Lending helping hands when I'm able
Seem like everybody ungrateful
When they every bought food to my table?
Unappreciative it don't phase me
See envy all in they faces
You ain't help or right a rapper through a day in jail
I ain't see yo name on no paper
Hard on hoes I been scarred
But Trell left a hole in my heart
Blood sweat and tears went into this
How you think you deserve part?
Child support court or get fought
All the best lawyers get bought

Let that other nigga take care of that
You be on his dick like his shit raw
Lied to you in his friend car
Sold you a dream and you got caught
These hoes want rap niggas or a athlete that play ball
Sip coffee peep it don't talk
Handle shit horribly we fall off
I was just tryna be a real friend to you now
I'm wishing that we get lost
We was only fifteen at ya momma house
Clicked over hold up miss call
Phone ringing damn it's my dawg
Thinking like how the fuck he know y'all?
In the same breath start hiking saying to myself really that's foul

Don't worry I'm just in my feelings
It's not a bad thing bae
It's nice to have someone that understands me bae

Late night, when alone, can't sleep
I got too many problems
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Pray that heaven do something about it
The chick that I'm lovin'
Wondering who is she fuckin'
The friends I got 'round me
Wonder which one of them sour
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, bitch I'm pourin' the
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Bitch I'm pourin' the syrup

Bitch I'm pourin' the syrup

I was naive, thinking that I couldn't get hurt
Thought she was faithful, fuck her but my dick burnt
Everybody laughed when I kissed her
I can't even lie, to this day still I miss her
We was on Scottsdale Inn by Jay's
Used to go to sleep in the pussy on an air mat
André Harris talked bad behind my back
Even though it hurted, I ain't tripping, never mind that
Me and Darrell Harris in a stolen car thugging
You get out of line, he goin' put you in a puddle
Me and Brittney Harris in the side room cuddlin'
Eat the pussy while she on the rag, like ""Yummy""
My daddy nephew, kinda make him my cousin
We was having lunch at Chimes when you told me that you love me
I ain't never back down from a fight in my life
Big Yock slapped you, you went and got your cousin
Nigga shot and missed, and I came back jumping
I was 13 when I put one under
Ask my mama, go ask my brother
Go on South 12th, and go ask Big London (shoutout)
Jamison and Gary and Will know the truth
I was selling crack with the cameras on the roof
You was never that, at the plant working turnarounds (turnarounds?)
Little Steve hittin' your bitch from the back, matter fact
That's a fact, when I seen it, had to turn around
E-Dub, Dope Boy, Lil E, Big Mook
Me and Foots in my truck with the burners out
When you was on 3rd St., and ain't wanna squeeze
Pillow talking with your bitch, tryna play me like I'm weak
Now I'm coming at your girl, top nigga, no problem
You will never find out another thing about it
Come to think about it, got a coffee shop in Denver, Colorado
I'mma catch her when she visiting her mama
Ri-Ri, fine, you're old man hate me?
Can't rap like Gates, fucking up lately?
Me, you, and Dreka oughta take a vacation
We can have a threesome after waking up in Vegas
Give you 50k, fail to mention what it came with
Eat, pray, making love, see the world baby
Breadwinners swim where I'm fucking with a gangsta
You can model for my line, I can make you famous
Running from my tongue when I lick all in your anus
Intelligent the way I talk, vagina I contained it
Ever been ate, two mouths at the same time?
Ever had lips on your booty and your pussy
Got your body feeling mushy
When your water go to gushing
Brazillian wax, I don't like playing in the bushes
Pull your hair, smack it, bend back, get a whoopin'

Late night, when alone, can't sleep
I got too many problems
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Pray that heaven do something about it
The chick that I'm lovin'
Wondering who is she fuckin'

Wonder which one of them sour
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup

Fuck a meeting we about to have a sit down
Wrap the phone up in plastic and stick it in the fridge
They know where we are, but they don't know what we did
Anything bout a mix-up, murder getting sent
Gotta speak in code when you talking on the phone
Sticking to the code, they'll listen to the song
I told my team about manifestation
People are basic they thought I was crazy
Ball with the witchcraft, study every night
Philosopher stone, I perform another rite
Rite meaning ritual, created dry ice
Hid in plain sight where the suit and tie nice
Makes it mean more than a brick layer
Salmonella moving chicken got my chick paid
Poison that was giving, distributed in the streets
Find another way to eat, I'mma quit slanging
Bread Winner gang made niggas quit hanging
Other side hate it when a nigga bang money
Thumbing through the law books (And he know the law?)
Sent a hit in Baton Rouge (And he getting off?)
Bird-eye focus (Wonder what he saw?)
Power in the (bullets in your car)
You ain't want a head and all you tried to pull it but you lost
War never knew mercy
Our Lady of the Lake won't receive you with open arms
You in yellow tape
Manuchi going stupid, he'll do it everyday
Talking bout leaving your grandmother, and will do it in your face
Shitting in the jack nigga you got do-do in your face
What you doing? Don't you know it ain't no doing it with Gates?
Peculiar, oolier, noodle your grape
Lot of days spent in the cage, wasn't what you think
Washing clothes with the toilet water, drinking out the sink
Hard mat hurt your back when it's no option
Everybody boxed in, trying to release toxins

Fuck a meeting we about to have a sit down
Not a part of this, pussy nigga can't sit 'round
Bread Winner business, model bitches getting dicked down
Get the phone back when they finish, get em' kicked out
All in favor for a favor for a favor
Any other matter we gon' bring it to the table
Organization gotta have communication
Full participation, Bread Winner's in the making
Fuck a meeting we about to have a sit down
Got the bread and basket then we split it with the clique now
Bought a share together people feel like we the shit now
Passing through your section I ain't showing no affection to a nigga or a bitch
Take a whiff no you sick now
Syrup, drinking out the bottle how I sip now
Ride around the bottom with the tint down
I'm a shooter, got a pistol with the dick out
True story, what I rap about I lived out
That's why I got a pistol with the dick out

Fucked up feeling when you get it from the gutter
Be the people in your own hood steady saying fuck ya
Way a nigga living when you see me in the picture 
Difficult to tell the difference in the season when I'm thugging
Heart cold, long nose, stumping through the jungle
Automatic that I'm packing, wearing jackets in the summer
Body being healed, having trouble with my left foot
Learned how to fight different, caught him with the left hook
Really pushing D with the clip, cooking Ki's
Many probably agree, on TV was the best look
Anticipated launch or a lift-off
Metaphor, going opposite of dick-soft
Mind on the ticket, out the mud seen Nicki album cover
Would make the dick spit, but it's still soft
Get out my cell when I shit, get lost
I'll punch a nigga down when I'm pissed off
Wanna wrestle, had to put him in a hip-toss
Lot of rap niggas backwards, criss-cross
Guess I never had swag

Pants tight on your ass, matter fact while you at it, put on lip gloss
Mind rambling, I guess it kinda slipped off
When Drake and Rihanna's song Take Care 
Playing tears running down my face I ain't playing
Miss laying with my bitch having real-talks
Laying in her lap with her fingers in my scalp 
Get to rubbing on my back till I drift off
Affection ain't cheap, coming with cost
Paying all the bills when the rent call
Fucking with a NFL player when his check long
Running back as if a running-back
Hard to stomach that you let him fuck for nothing 
When you find out that the check gone
Found a ex-NBA player knowing that's wrong
Un-loyal you a slut, you get stepped on
Who your baby daddy? Picked me but you guessed wrong
Your mother mad 'cause she couldn't pawn me
Got it from the concrete
To stand up in your chest under everybody
What you witnessing me getting richer failed to mention that I'm winning
Same nigga that you slept on

Went from rugged, took some losses, money doubled
Toilet bowl, think it's shittin' on 'em, fuck it
Playin' chess and the bishop on the muscle
You would never love me like my daughter love me

I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dogg and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah

Actors got stripes they ain't never earned
Not a freak for fame, rather wait my turn
Say he tell it, tell it put him in the dirt
Fuck his family members, they can wear his shirt
Every rapper talkin' cookin' dope
Flippity flip, break-break the wrist
I desire and I would be alone, no attention if it's ignorance
To say it frankly, I don't give a shit
Breathin' hard, come on say what's in your thoughts
Somethin' on your mind, I could take it off
Money mean nothin', I want my respect
Different focus on tatted on my flesh
Hoes in my clothes, underarms smellin'
Million man march this ain't Malcolm X
Where I'm fair receivin' government assistance
Get up out the bed, spend up all they check
How you don't know that, you ain't never gagged
What you mean by yay, talkin' sellin' crack
Embalming fluid, run to Montana
Thinking going back and peddle where
Pistols, rentals, thugs stoppin' up the rig
Renegade hoes settin' up the trick
Junkies usin' H, it's a better feel

Ain't been havin' no dreams
Don't be gettin' no sleep
How could someone call me those things
They don't even know me
I lost everything I love and we could go
Loyalty which probably mean the most
Heart played on every time I gave
Makin' me a freak bitch
Big dog, mouth full of gold
Big loud, I don't skip road
Mean died, out 20 shows
Radio stop playin' songs
I ain't really feel like I was wrong
Southside finest get it on
Right back grindin', teeth grittin'
Ship sinkin', cry about it? No
Catch 'em with the lyrics on a whim
The one who spoke the laws I am him
Started out, we wanted us some ends
Late night discussion of a Benz
Late night we fussin' 'bout the rent
Eviction notice posted, I ain't notice
Focused tryna get another flip
Wasn't makin' half of what I spent
T-Newman passenger, we lit
I just got with Mo, that's a lick
Conversation with the boss man, look
We was talkin' signin' him again
Women wanna con in front they friends
Like you was not respectin' what it is
Listen when I tell you what it is
To be around you signin' a consent
You know I just got married to your friend
I done threw a ring around the dick
Diamonds dancin' every time I spit
Had to throw some bling up on a bitch
Self made stand up guy
God first, hands to the sky
All I do is ride nigga, yeah
I don't even argue about the bread
And the money that you owe me, you can have
I can't even see me gettin' mad
I can't even see me goin' backwards
Know you wanna see me on my ass
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?
I just rolled a stick with Mad-Ab
Please me let me enjoy the ride back
And please me let me enjoy the ride back
Could you please me let me enjoy the ride back?
I just rolled a stick with Mad-Ab
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?

Because you never know when it could be over. So, I just enjoy this bitch

Frownin' while she take it, she don't like to make sounds
Bought a one way ticket, put her on the Greyhound
Workin' our hotels right before they played out
What's the problem? Why you not smilin'? We in the prime of our life
Supposed to be havin' the time of our life
Excuse the misunderstandin', sometimes you be so demandin'
Don't like to be told what to do, difficult but we manage
Said some things I didn't mean, caused emotional damage
I love the streets, I'm a gangster, I like to be in them daily
Your mother love me like a son but I'm not seein' me changin'

Million dollar vision, you just gotta stay down
Don't get all in your feelings babe don't throw your weight around
She gon' kill herself if I leave but she know I don't play around
Got one text in this evenin', say she just made it in town
Wonderin' if I could see her, got some things to figure out
I ain't mean it, I was bluffin', thinkin' please don't leave me now
Boys II Men, I'm down on bended knees listenin' to The Weeknd
Now friends hate me sayin' ""girl look when did he get out?""
My mother left when I was young
I'm commitment shy so when feelin's get involved I tend to run
Sometimes emotions get the best of me clearly
And I ain't never tried to straddle no fences
Been back and forth for a minute
And I know I seem rough
I've been hurt and you the only one that mean somethin'

See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her 'round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collard shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
I came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic

Do you think I'll ever need your love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her 'round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Ain't no relaxin', pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a-, I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang 'bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, cover hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion

Brains blowed out, I'm still goin' to court
Rest in piece gangster Reezy,  I miss you swear to God
Marquise got murdered two weeks after we talked
That other boy pussy, he lyin', we never fought
Scared of a nigga the yard he never walked
Caught him in the (?) 'round the freak people
Locker full of shit, nigga I can feed people
Penitentiary rich, got phones in the line
BWA, I was strong in the mind
Drinker come and visit got richer just let it pow
Julio I miss you, just hit me when you get out
Free throw shot to (?) right on consignment could get him out
I don't want to touch 'em, test somethin' nigga, we swap it out
Bullet after bullet after bullet after bullet
Walked down out the cut stand up in your chest
Rubber band up, never seen it, I'm a skeptic
Ya'll praise a bitch nigga but I still ain't get it yet

And Luther break it down like

Ridin' around in my whip, listenin' to my shit
She want to hear track six, she told me that's her (jam)
Baby girl said I got the title, got a nigga feelin' like Michael
Jackson, Jordan, don't matter to me they both (jam)
I'm all in her head, she's all in my bed
I'm locked and loaded, ready to go like a gun that don't (jam)
I'm all in-between, that's all that she needs
Her body rockin', nobody stoppin', this song is probably on (jam)

Listen all you like
Tattoos showin' out the shower in the mirror, go to clickin' on the lights
And this ain't what you like (jam)
I can lay you on your back then I hit you with the pound game
Pin you down so you can't run, in and out game
Hit you from the back, probably get you with the mouth game
Ain't nobody business, this is our thing (jam)
Spit all in-between both cheeks, now I spread 'em
Bet the neighbors know my name when you keep sayin' Kevin
Hands behind, I'ma stand behind you
Pullin' on your hair, lot of ass behind you (jam)
Got me sayin', ""ooh keep goin' with your moves""
Candles by the bed, God damn this a movie
Stuffin' you with dick while my finger in your booty

No draws underneath, with the slits in the side
Squintin' my eyes, locked in with the notion
If she squint back, bet I'm approachin'
Playin' my song, slow dancin' to Strokin'
Track number seven, told me it was her (jam)
Do you kiss with your friend? Oh you roll with your friends?
Start the car and I get in, we rollin'
Let the leaf hit the green, we smokin'
Slow motion coupe just floatin'
Kissin' on her finger with my hand on her breast
Tongue doin' circles round the ring of her nipple
Would you mind on repeat but she might be trippin'
Really, not really, sayin' it was her (jam)

Stays back on W
I'ma show her what this pipe game do
I'ma hit her till the sky turn blue

Stayed fly
Just in case I caught your eye
What is it you don't see in me

Big Ron jumping out of cars
Seen my process get destroyed
Hard to say I love you when I don't
Stubborn, not admitting when I'm wrong
Smoke clears, not enough alone
Passing by your grandmothers house
Hoping I could catch you outside
Stepping out, I gotta dress fly
Hoping, we could maybe catch eye
I'm that little nigga now
Balling for billions
I'm leaning, a hell of a feeling now
Turn the lights down, mouth blinging
Goddamn just what I was thinking
Big Jigga talking about banging
Actually I'm thinking 'bout sneezing
Never change up
Never change up
Gave the lames up
In the game
Never gave a name up
Murder gang
I am Louie banged up
But I move those thangs
I don't do no gang banging

AMG, big body coupe
Passing through the ghetto, they salute
Broke and out of dope
They was acting like they didn't have smoke on 'em
Now we on the road, my cologne got a strong odor
Asking where you been at little homie
Smell like you got a pound of smoke on ya
Mall shopping look at what I found
Private jets, we not on the ground
12 am, smell of coffee grounds
Gates right back at it once again
I'm a gangster, my administration
Go and get it, I don't to no waiting man

Smell like Teen Spirit, I am Kurt Cobain

We’ll be waiting a long time
For the feeling to unwind
To unwind, ahh

Feels like there’s a bullet hole
Somewhere deep inside my soul
Somewhere deep inside

It’s filling up with emptiness
Loneliness and bitterness
And I can’t tell you why

But I remember you would scold
“You can’t play Abbey Road
In the shuffle mode”

We’ll be waiting a long time
For the feeling to unwind
To unwind, ahh

We’ll be waiting a long time
For the feeling to unwind
To unwind ahh

Kevin Hearn,"Under a canoe, sheltered from the hail
We met six miles down the portage trail
I met her mom, I met her pops
They looked at me and licked their chops

She’s born human, raised by wolves
Will she ever understand my world?
Born human into this crazy world
Then one day she wandered deep into the woods

Into the woods
(The deep, dark woods)
Into the woods
(The deep, dark woods)
Ah, the woods
(The deep, dark woods)
Into the woods
(The deep, dark woods)

Her eyes follow my hands a map of blue veins
To a fork in the low chowmein
Her eyes get that mischievous spark
Chasing pigeons down in the park

She’s born human, raised by wolves
Will she ever understand my world?
Born human into this crazy world
Then one day she wandered deep into the woods

Kevin Hearn,"All the way to shepherd and young
We rode the subway every day
But now a change is gonna come
I’m gonna miss those days

There was a billboard on the wall
At my favorite stop
The words in print were bold and tall
I could feel my heart drop

Here come the Chimebell trains
Here come the Chimebell trains
I’m gonna miss the whistle blowing
Here come the Chimebell trains

Collecting transfers, skipping school
We would trade in the parking lot
I said, “Got 'em, got 'em, got 'em”
Because I had every stop

That she’s grown up
Maybe now she’ll get out
Of that crazy house

We were friends back then
But she never invited me in

We lived on a quiet street line with tall trees
After dinner all the kids played hide and seek
One day I hid behind the house where she lived

Won’t forget what I saw that day through the back window
That cruel memory will always haunt me
I want to run into that place
Find who took the smile from off your face

We met under a willow tree?
And I liked you and you liked me

You would share your dreams with me
We’d laugh and sing and everything

Do you remember way back then?

Then I got really sick
And had to go on that bad trip
Swimming in the river Styx
You watched me sinking like a brick

Oh, and it was rough
And we both had about as much
As we could take
Something had to break

I decided in my head
That I would come back from the dead
Just to see you smile again
To hear you laugh, to hold your hand

But we both had changed
Nothing was the same
It’ll never be the same but

Kevin Hearn,"Sometimes you crash into love, and it smashes your whole world apart, and it's great
When you want to take the long way home and you want to sing a song out loud on the street
My life had all but gone to hell when you climbed out of the wishing well last week
Now the shadow puppet on the wall is finally letting the peaceful fall asleep

And when our time has come
They say a light will lead us on

Loneliness as black as night, does darkness ever crave the light of day?
Like a moth attracted to the light that promises to show the way

And when our time has come
They say a light will lead us on

Where someone punched me in the face

And a time machine

What a blessing to be unspoiled

When you know things could be so much better

It helps to believe in something

Kevin Johansen,"El que se quede sin dar el paso, no voy a ser yo
Quien se canse de tus abrazos, no voy a ser yo
No voy a ser yo, no voy a ser yo

Tengo tiempo y tengo paciencia, y sobre todo
Te tengo dentro de mi existencia de cualquier modo
Y aunque falte tal vez bastante, no voy a ser yo
El que se canse antes, no voy a ser yo

Hay gente que no debería enamorarse
Algunos no deberíamos dar el sí
Yo no veo otra salida, no quiero pasar la vida
Sin que la vida pase a través de mí

Quien se esconda de lo que siente, no voy a ser yo
No voy a pisar el freno, no voy a ser yo
El que se ande con más o menos, no voy a ser yo

Hay gente que no debería involucrarse
Con cosas que luego no pueden manejar
Yo no veo otra salida, no quiero pasar la vida
Pisando una piedra y volviéndola a pisar

Si quieres un príncipe azulado, no voy a ser yo
Si quieres un, 'Bangundangunladu', no voy a ser yo

Kevin Johansen,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

A Albert Plá  
Las cosas no andaban bien, nada me salía, 
Mi vida era un túnel sin salida, pero
 
Desde que te perdí se están enamorando todas de mí 
Y hasta algunas me quieren convencer 
Que con ellas podría ser feliz. 
 
Desde que te perdí las puertas 
Se me abren de par en par, 
Se me abrió hasta la puerta de Alcalá 
Y yo aprovecho cada oportunidad. 
 
Desde que te perdí nunca tuve tal libertad 
Desde que te perdí no me importa nada de ná 
 
Desde que te perdí la vida me sonríe sin cesar, 
Tengo trabajo y mucha estabilidad 
Y hasta he trepado en la escala social. 
 
De ágape en ágape, 
Princesas me sonríen de cuando en vez, 
Me dicen el Hugh Hefner Aragonés, 
Seguro que no sabes ni quién es
 
Desde que te perdí hago lo que me da la gana 
Desde que te perdí ya no tengo ganas de nada 
 
Desde que te perdí tomamos unas cañas por ahí,

Que ahora también eres mucho más feliz

Kevin Johansen,"There's a gem in every person
And there's a gem in I
Everybody's got a soft spot
Even the porcupine

Don't listen to the rhythm
Don't think about these words
Just think about a river

Listen to the birds
They know that you're looking
For something to happen
And it will happen soon

There's a God in every body
And there's a God in you
Everyone comes into this world
Without a license or a shoe

Just listen
They know that you're looking
For something to happen
And it will happen soon

Give in to love, give in to something else
Than your selfish self
Give in to love and suddenly
Your world will turn round

There's a soul in every person
And there's a soul in you
Every body has a spirit
Even the well to do

Just look at all the people
All running with the herd
Behind all of our actions
Beneath all of our words

They know so much more
Than what we'll ever fathom
And you know something too

Give in to love, give in to something else
Than your selfish self
Give in to love, give in to love
And suddenly your world will turn round

No turning back, the river's run dry.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Kevin Mahogany,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't forget her

Kevin Mahogany,"My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
And as I go my way alone,
I find it hard for me to carry on.
I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.

Seem to follow me wherever I go

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

And start heading for the door

There's that anguish, there's that doubt

I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name, and my heart stood still
When He said, ""Son, go do my will""

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter
Tell him God Almighty's gonna cut him down

You can run now for a long time

Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You may throw your rock, hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made day and night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light

You may run and hide, slip and slide
Try to take the mote from your neighbor's eyes
Oh yeah, as sure as God made the rich and poor
You're gonna reap just what you sow, oh, oh no

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)

Some people go to church just to signify
Trying to make a date with the neighbor's wife
Well then, let me tell you, just as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone

'Cause one of these days, just mark my word
Think that brother has gone to work
You sneak right up, knock on that door
That's all, brother, you'll knock no more

Kevin Maynor,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Girl, I never meant to cause you pain
And I only have myself to blame

Now you're gone and I can't stop thinking of you
Every time I hear your name
I think of what I've done again and again

See I'm all alone tonight with just a memory
And baby you're a million miles away
I can't take another day

If I ain't got you, I ain't got anything
It just don't feel the same, no
If I ain't got you, oh

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

I remember when we were together
I remember how you used to say
There was nothing I could do to turn you away

I know, I know that things have changed forever
When I look into your eyes
All I see now is the tears in your eyes

I'm all alone tonight with just a memory
And baby you're a million miles away
I can't take another day

If I ain't got you, I ain't got anything
It just don't feel the same, no
If I ain't got you, oh

And if I ain't got you, I ain't got anything
Can't even feel the pain
No, if I ain't got you, you

If I could I would pick up the pieces of your broken heart
And put it back together
And I would, I would hold you in my arms until the hurting stops
And stay right here forever

Kevin Michael,"I can't get enough of that
I can't get enough of that girl
Kevin Michael, Shorty Da Kid, lets go

When I first saw her she was licking her lips
With a gold chain hanging off the side of her hips
Glossy as the pages of a magazine
Got to figure how to get you on the team

So I asked if we could sit on the steps
And let a young G kick it from the right to the left
Gotta keep it movin? and work the game
Trying to spend a minute up next to your frame

she's so fine that it really, really blows my mind
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the morning, in the evening
Somebody shake me ?cause I feel like I'm dreaming
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the bedroom, on the table
Whenever, wherever I'm willing and I'm able
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

We took a ride in my Coupe De Ville
Doing drive-by?s all day, if looks could?ve killed
She would be the bullet that hit me hard
Got that kinda ass that's dangerous

And I ain't trying to be the one that she played
?Cause she's a dime, my nigga and I want her to stay
Brain that's just as bangin? as the body and
Shawty got me thinking I'm a family man

she's so fine that it really, really blows my mind
I just can't help myself
I can't get enough
I can't get enough of that girl

In the morning, in the evening
Somebody shake me ?cause I feel like I'm dreaming
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the bedroom, on the table
Whenever, wherever I'm willing and I'm able
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

Hold on, stop, somebody blow the whistle
I gotta call a time out ?cause baby?s so official
It hit me like a missile when I seen it, shawty got me feelin?
Rise of the sun till the evening

Got me wanna clean and cook, maybe I'm dreaming
Listen, ba boom, ba boom, hear my heart beating
Weekends I don't even hit the club
?Cause first we on the couch then in the tub

In the bed it?s whatever she wanna do
We stop, take a break and get ready for round two
?Cause I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

she's five foot nothing, I'm feeling the frame
A man that donkey on the back but like you need to be tamed
See I got her by the game, you know it?s a fact, boy
She telling all her friends she go with a track, boy, ay

she's so fine that it really, really, really blows my mind
And I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

In the morning, in the evening
Somebody shake me ?cause it feels like I'm dreaming
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

She turned out the light and she's turning me on
And I'm turnin? her out till the break of dawn
I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

Kevin Michael,"I started out at the top of your list
And now this? Come on
It?s real funny how the thing you used to run to
Becomes the thing that haunts you

The future means the past
I size him up real quick and in a flash
I'm the same guy who made you laugh
Now I make you mad

he's the one you choose
How did I get things so confused?
I thought I had that, I tried to get back
But now I got it bad, yeah

I really wanted you
Now the sound of my voice is gonna haunt you
Picked him but I was the one who loved you the most
Instead our love is dead and I'm nothing more to you than a

Ghost, pass right through me
Heartbroken, I know you can see right through me
I'm in hell ?cause heaven was so close
But instead my love is dead and I'm nothing more to you than a

Ghost, Mr. Invisible, so hard to let it go
I'm a ghost, he wins, I lose
Baby, I?ll be missing you
I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost

And I love her even more
But I'm stuck on the other side of the door
And she can't hear me, she can't feel me
Same thing like Demi Moore

Divided what we had
Add the new man, do the math
Wish I could work it out but it?s over now
I gave it all I had, all I had

You know how much I wanted you
Now the sound of my voice is gonna haunt you
You picked him but you knew that I loved you the most
Instead our love is dead and I'm nothing more to you than a

Ghost, pass right through me

I'm a ghost, he wins, I lose
Baby, I?ll be missing you
I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost

You can't just expect me to not wanna be on your list
And you can't just expect me to get over the warmth of your kiss
You can't be serious or furious, he has the woman I love the most
But I can't have, I couldn't have that's all you have when you're a ghost

I say, ghost

Ghost, pass right through me
Heartbroken, I know you can see right through me
I'm in hell ?cause heaven was so close
But instead my love is dead and I'm nothing more to you than a

Ghost, Mr. Invisible, so hard to let it go

Hey, little girl, don't cry, dry your eyes
I wrote this song for you
Now, it goes down

Can you imagine every world?
Every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things
They'd all get the same things

A little dough, a lot of love
With a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things

Huh, but down here the world is real
And it don't matter how you feel
Because, we don't get the same things
We don't get the same things

You got to work to stay alive
Forty hours, from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things

All my gangster friends, yeah
And all my skater friends
(What they want?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
We all want the same thing, yeah

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, now

And, I think about the way
All the politicians say
(What they saying, now?)
Say they want to change things
Say they want to change things

But every year, they take some more
And I don't know what it's for
Though, they never change things
(They don't change nothing)

But, if you want to make it stop, stop
Well, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes
Doing some different things, yeah

Get up out your bed, think outside your head
And you won't get the same things
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, now

All my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
(What they want, now?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
I said, we all want the same thing

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
(What they doing, now?)
They all want the same thing
(What they want, now?)
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
(And what you say, what you say?)

Yeah, first say pie to the people
The have's and the have not's
Are we willing to give up all the hours
Just to make it all equal?

And make players out the mascots?
'Cause, right now, we don't see you
Like the Sasquatch
Unless, the root of all evil is what you have got

You're even more visible
If your hair is lots
If not banging from the beach
Then banish you to the sand box

With no lifeguard to come after you
No amount, you don't count, like Dracula
Your bound to drown like a Titanic passenger
Or, a Haitian refugee trafficker

They come and get you off the island
That you crashed into
They take a yacht
And send the slave ship back for you

Money matters, don't let it master you
Pressing on the answer
Till they give you what you're asking for
It's like that, yeah, it's like that

This is a message to
Remind you there's just one who calls love
Take them to church, Kevin

All my gangster friends
(What they want, now?)
And all my skater friends
We all want the same thing
I said, we all want the same thing

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
(What they want?)
And all their new boyfriends
They all want the same thing
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah

Que no son nuestros besos deseo estar contigo hasta morir

Seguro que volverá

Depende de ti, si vuelve y sucede
Si es solo sexo
Y a ninguno de los dos nos duele
Yo sé que tu cuerpo quiere
No estés más sola
Pide que yo este
Tocando tu piel
Rápidamente
Llegando al siguiente nivel
Teniéndote en las posiciones
Que hace mucho tiempo
Te quise tener (KR)
Disfrutando los dos de ese momento intenso
Se me eriza la piel, cada vez que lo pienso
Si lo hace de ese modo
Puede que vuelva y suceda una vez más
Si lo tenemos claro
Nos evitaremos muchas lagrimas
Y si lo hacemos de ese modo esta vez
Solo será relax, pasión, cero estrés
No lo pienses y hagámoslo de una vez
Si hace tiempo lo queremos
Porque dejarlo para después (KR)
Y no lo vayas a tomar mal
Que tan solo quiera algo sexual
Solo si tú no te enamoras

And I’m just tryna show him it’s all in the passion
I got dreams bigger than life, only I can imagine
Just want my expectations and what’s meant to be to have at it
So I’d rather overdo everything than half ass it
That’s why I remain to speak my piece and stand my ground
Keep my head high, won’t swallow pride
Just take my time, won’t compromise
For nobody, 'cause we can all be somebody (somebody)

Gotta figure out what you wanna be rather than just don’t wanna be
Down your chones, 'cause this is where I wanna be

Lately I’ve been realizing its all of what you make it

And you smile, won't fool this masquerade
If there's a God, why won't he help me through the pain?

Who'd swapped dirty pictures and talked during prayers.
They grew up with wisdom they'd stored from ""those days""
Nobody told them to get in they must change.
I'll show you them now. Come with me and
I'll show you them now.
The teachers laughed with them class idiot style.
After all they weren't their kids so why should they mind.
Boyish good looks held the wrath back a while.
Then they were drummed in and thumped in and soon left behind.
Alcoholics, child molesters, nervous wrecks and prima donnas
Jilted lovers, office clerks, petty thieves, hard drug pursuers.
Lonely tramps, awkward misfits, oh anyone of these.
Mortgaged up families looked at first too mundane.
But it's funny how with help all the lucky ones changed.
Some of them couldn't, there had to be more.
Music, I dunno, films, something special perhaps.
I'll show you them now, come with me
And I'll show you them now.
It's so hard to picture dirty tramps as young boys.
But if you see a man crying, hold his hand, he's my friend.
If these words sound corny, switch this off, I don't care.
Nearby he's still crying, I won't smile while he's there.

Ya, but now I'm on top.
I told you to let it rock
Now money's fallin' from the sky-y-y-y-y
I made it.

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt.
I made it, I made it!

Rooftop, hella choppa' burning smoke
Louie bag stay strapped wit a priceless globe
High life, flippin' and get some more.
Paradise, the luxury marble floor
When I hit, nigga hit me full of that cash
More money than I seen in a garbage can
Stunna' island, money and the power
That's how we do it, make it rain make it shower
Top floor, big timer doing big things
Over city views bought shawty new range
Flip another hundred, poppin' throwing hundreds
In a new Bentley, uptown stunna

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt.
I made it, I made it!

Ooh I made it, I made it!
I made it, I made it!
I I I made it!

See I don't live for glamor and I don't care for fame
I'm in this for the love of the game
Funny how things can change
They didn't believe in me then
Now they calling my name
Now look who cashed in
They didn't wanna know me back then
But ever since I don' gone platinum
Everything turned around
And now the sky is falling down

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt.
I made it, I made it!

Came from the gutter, lookin' like my motha'
Made it to the goal line, straight out the huddle
Cash money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy we getting money like we just found oil
Uh and that's word to my red flag
I live first and leave the bullshit dead last
I lay it down so hard I got a bed rash
And I just tell 'em to loaf it when the bread pass
Staring at you from the top of the game man
I might drop the world if I change hands
Uh, it feel good to be here, Weezy in the building got this bitch rebuilt
Young Money

I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about, the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt.
I made it, I made it!

I look up to the sky!
I made it! I made it!

To get five luminous minutes with me

This isn't my style,
I spit what I'm living right now
I'm out on the town, gold bars shutting it down
Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceiling
Then it's a loud fool,
Fifty-third street, right near the Hilton
I'm fighting the feeling I had
When I was lighting up buildings
Now I'm writing for millions of listeners
Critics who just don't get it
They try dissing us,
New York full of kings and queens,
All the rest just mimic us

Kevin Rudolf,"One night when I was asleep
I had a dream I could fly
I felt the cold on my skin then I opened my eyes
So I jumped out of bed went down the fire escape
Now I'm laid out on the street I wasn't running away
From something I could control it was inside of me
I didn't know where to go but I decided to leave
I still remember that night I've never been the same
Still wonder if I can fly, was it just a dream?

I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape
But now it's to late to say, I'm sorry

Turn around [x15]

One night when I couldn't sleep
I heard a knock at the door
She pulled her head on me slow then she opened my heart
I asked myself is this real I've never felt this way
She said I need to escape I said I know a place
So she laid down on my bed I said confide in me
She looked deep into my eyes and she invited me
She must have left me asleep she never said goodbye
Her angels took her away I guess now she can fly

I wasn't happy for so long so many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

Kevin Rudolf,"She walks in the room
In her mind she's far away
I can see her emptiness
But I just don't feel her pain

The love is gone
The only thing she was living for
Mister I'll never leave you
Walked right out the door, oh

It's killing me inside
The way I've seen her change
She writes her life story
But she can't turn the page
I hold her had, try to take her
But she pulls away
Shades go down, lights go out
There's nothing left to say

[Chorus:]
So I'm singing
I want it all but I take just a little
I feel her touch then I need some more
We get high just to try and relieve the pain
But a voice inside reminds me there must be a better way, oh

So I leave the room
'Bout halfway down the hall
I turn around, she screams out
What, you don't believe in love
Said I'll never be who I was when I was seventeen
'Cause every time I walk away
I leave a piece of me

[Chorus:]

Now I understand
What they were trying to say
Life goes by too fast
And people change
But she just wants to be
Who she always was
But you can't change a single thing
You might as well look up and sing

I, I just take a little
I then I need some more
We get high to relieve the pain
But there is a voice inside me saying you'd better walk away

And I take just a little
I, oh to relieve the pain we get high
Some things never change
But a voice inside reminds me there must be
Be better way",I Song

What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

I'm out on the town, gold bars shuttin' it down
Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceilin'
Then it's a loud fool, fifty third street, right near the Hilton
I'm fightin' the feelin' I had when I was lightin' up buildings

Now I'm writin' for millions of listeners
Critics who just don't get it
They try dissin' us, New York full of kings and queens
All the rest just mimic us

'Cause in the city of dreams
You get caught up in the schemes
And fall apart in the seam tonight
That boy would play his guitar
Like he was ready for war
And then he'd lift up his voice to the sky

Kevin Rudolf,"I see your dirty face, high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

[Chorus]
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

[Chorus]

Yeah! Wayne's world
Planet Rock, panties drop
And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara 
I'm in here up like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

[Chorus: x2]

Just let it rock
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

I'm back like I forgot something, I'm something
Rollin' Rock rubbing rap running
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder

I wish I could be, as cruel as you
And I wish I could say, the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie, no not this time",Let It Rock [Without Rap]

Kevin Rudolf,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Longest road I ever seen
Part of me wanted to stay
Part of me just had to leave

Not the person that I became
It's okay, I can see
You're afraid

I can leave, you can stay
Now I gotta be on my way
All I ever wanted to do
Is follow this dream, till I made it come true
All I ever wanted to be 
Is more than a lie
That you still believe
And I'll leave Tennessee
And I'll leave Tennessee
Yeah

Baby did you know I'm alive
It ain't the resurrection of Christ
I know I tried to swallow my pain
Last night I never survived
It's okay, I can see
You're afraid
I can leave, you can stay

Just get out of my fucking way

Is follow this dream, till I made it come true
All I ever wanted to be

In a world where nothin' is ever what it seems
Had to find a way, so I play guitar but I never knew if I would make it far.

We'll be right back on our feet

That I ran away
Cause I'm comin' back for you one day
I'm comin' back for you one day
I'm comin' back for you one day

I turn the corner and crash my car
I told you I was at the grocery store
I guess you don't love me no more

But I'm tryna find my way home

I'm comin' back for you one day

When the skies get dark, no, don't be scared
Cause it's you and I till the day we die
I just want you to know

Kevin Rudolf,"You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful.
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel.
But I already know what you came for.
You make the rain fall.

Well, your eyes are so deceiving
Deadly as a loaded gun.
Your words are so misleading.
You tell me I'm the only one.

And it feels so good tonight
But it get me every time.
And I-I know I'll never change my ways
But every single night I pray.

But I already know what you came for.

Hey, this girl make the rain drop
Giving me pain in the same spot
Go in my pockets, my wallet, I got it
She gettin my dollars the same waup

Umbrella's lit up on the same block
The weather keeps pouring; This dame's hot
Lil' mamma handle herself on the pole
I can throw some more fish off the same dock

Clouds over my head
Thunder and lightening
She flashing for bread
She make a storm, I'm already prepared
Who do I want, 'cause I cut the checks
Shorty, she more the Jacuzzi with jets
They use a mop for this when it's wet
They stop the drizzle, I walk on the set
I got the bar, girl, I'm telling you

You make the rain fall
'Cause you're so beautiful that it's painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for

So I stand in line
You tell me the lies
To keep me up all night
And I don't even know your name
But every night I pray
Yeah

Kevin Rudolf,"Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

Check it, always had big hopes as a kid
Just a rotten tomato building shit out of Legos
Can't hit the ball if you ain't swingin' the bat
And like a home run, that boy is not coming back
Rise like creams, kid with a dream
Went from never seeing straight to the face on a magazine
Now my team got anthems
Y'all frozen, a cold hook from the champion

Here we are, we are the champions (YMCMB)
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

You know you gotta be strong to survive
When everyone's trying to break you
So let ‘'em hate, just go your own way
Don't ever let ‘'em try and change you
I walk alone through the fire to the throne
I find myself in the dark, I close my eyes and there you are

Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one (yeah)
Still number one, still number one (yeah)
So here we are, we are the champions (Stunna, check me)

Rich gang, from Forbes to fortune and fame
Spit game, from millions to billions to gain
Life, triple crown on them bright lights
Sunny days, rainy nights on them global flights
Yeah, the like father, like son struggle
Mo' muscle, gun bussa, we flip digits
TRUK fitted, go get it
Ship it 'cause it's bigger than life

Here we are, we are the champions
We've come so far, they said it can't be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions (yeah)

Uh, number one in this motherfucker
Lil Weezy fuck the world with two dicks
But in the meantime I'mma have a nice time
Went from a con artist to an icon
Got the keys to success on my key ring
Used to dream about sugar, sweet dreams
But reality is a bitch and she my bitch
Sold my soul to the devil, made a profit
Tunechi

Here we are, we are the champions (yeah, ha ha)
We've come so far, they said it can't be done (pour some Gatorade on it)
And we right here, and we still number one (ah, yeah, yeah)
Still number one, still number one (oh yeah)
