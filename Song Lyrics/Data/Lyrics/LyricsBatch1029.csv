Armin van Buuren,"Something's disappeared inside 
Should I try to run away 
If I could I would escape you 

I won't argue anymore 
I have lost the will to be 
Hope you don't think I'm ungrateful 

Close the curtains, lock the door 
Left my notes upon the stair 
In the hope you wouldn't read them 

Fake emotions in my head 
Everything I've seen and read 
Can't begin to find the reason 

Why? Why are you laughing? 
Is it something that I said? 

I don't like this place at all 
Makes me wonder what I'm here for 
Someone take this pain away 
Dying to see another day 

And I don't want to be your friend 
Or pretend I can fit into 
I'm incensed, I'm blown away 
Dying to see another day 

I don't like this place at all 
Makes me wonder what I'm here for 
Someone take this pain away 
Dying to see another day 

And I don't want to be your friend 
Or pretend I can fit into 
I'm incensed, I'm blown away 
Dying to see another day",Yet Another Day [Video]
Armin van Buuren,"I won't ask you why
No I won't play devil's advocate
Don't wanna try and fix it
And make it about me
When you're lost and all alone in your pain
And nothing seems to make sense all in vain
You'll find in here that safe place to cry
And I'll just meet you there
Where ever low or high

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself
I'll listen

I'll listen, I will listen
I'll listen, I'll listen

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
If you need it
Just believe it
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself
When you feel it
Just believe it
I'll listen

I'll listen, I will listen
I'll listen, I'll listen

And you can share your heart
Show yourself
I'll listen
And you can say it all
Reveal yourself

Armin van Buuren,"Shoot me down and I'll get up again
Emotion running high with double meaning
Just another day to keep it calm within
But I can't find a way to fight this shadow dreaming

We're always waiting for the night
Never lost, we can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me where we can go where the light shines brightest

Stay all night, runaway all night
We'll stay all night runaway all night?

Push and shove against the thoughts you left me with
Every picture of regret my expectation
Your emotions can't hide behind those eyes
Conversations come quick to steal me back again

We're always waiting for the night
Never lost 'cause we can go where the light shines brightest

So come with me where we can go where the light shines brightest

Armin van Buuren,"Can you see this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes

You and me, we're just believers
Believing what we hold
But sometimes we fall to pieces
In the dusk

So we should dance like this forever
We're safer on the ground
When a million lights surround you
And you're moving to the sound

Don't waste another moment
It's waiting for you now
So dive in this new beginning
Let the glowing show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes

We'll take a ride outside together
The streets are lined with gold
Where the good become the wanted
Not the soul

Don't waste another moment
I'm waiting for you now
So dive in this new beginning
And let the colour show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm
My head above the crowd

Can you see this light between us
So come a little bit closer now
It's in our eyes
It's in our eyes

So dive in this new beginning
And let the colour show you how

I will take, this light between us
Keeps me breathing through the storm

When God will get his man

Come on come on give me my turn
To sing once more
And let it burn

‘Cause I’m
I’m just no good
So leave me, as you should
And surrender to some unholy war
‘Cause we forgot what we first came here for

Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels

Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

tear down the walls that are in the way

we can start all over, it's a brand new day

when the sun comes up, we'll look back and laugh

nevermind the numbers I can do the math

multiply everyone that I've ever known

you're the only one that feels like home

and a girl that was smiling and she looked just like you

Hide from fall, when we had it all

Under the pier we were hand and hand
Were younger then, way back when

Throwing rocks off the docks, regretting
What could I do, I was wrong for you

Moonlight and the smell of the ocean air
Close my eyes and I almost see you there

Under the sand, there's no hurry
They'll find it when, summer comes again

She's the picture of perfection, I'm a legend in my mind
They say that only fools rush in. Well, I'm the first in line
I'm working on my battle plan and wishing on a star
But I doubt that she'd go out with me 'cause I don't have a car
That I can drive around in circles
Does she love me, does she not?
Either way it doesn't matter 'cause I'm giving it a shot
It's not like if she shoots me down, it's headline breaking news
'Cause I may be a loser, but I don't have much to lose

Wide-eyed, tongue-tied, drama like Shakespeare

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I know who she is, and I know who I'm not
And I know what it takes and it's not what I got
But if you start from the heart and you end with a smile
Miracles happen every once and while

She's so cold, freezing like disco
Outlook is so-so

[Chorus:]

Army of Freshmen,"They're calling for snow
It's 40 below the weather when she had it together
Steering wheel's cold, she knows she's not old
To be feeling fairy tales have a ceiling
Land locked and alone, she picks up the phone that keeps ringing
The Beach Boys keep singing
""God Only Knows"", here comes the snow
She feels like the weather just keeps her forever

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

land locked and alone, she hangs up the phone
A wrong number in search of the summer
That someone else lives in, she's starting to give in
To habits like splitting she just isn't fitting
In the with the crowd or the oncoming clouds
That tear through the winter, slowly they splinter
The dreams that she had, she wanted so bad
Before the weather kept her forever

the forecast is calling for outcasts

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

as the snow globe on the dashboard crashes down against the ground
The ballerina that was trapped inside is free forever now

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember
Map on the wall that somebody else calls home

somewhere maybe in the Midwest, she sits waiting in a prom dress
Snowstorms and cold dorms and frozen boys who
Melt like snow in December, she can't help to remember

Army of Freshmen,"Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes 

Here comes the weekend, here comes the same old song
We keep singing but we get it wrong
At a party with more faces then friends
If the fun never starts then the fun never ends
But the weight of the town it just dragged us down
We know every street but we're lost not found
Screaming inside but we make no sound
Gearing up for the weekend let down

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes

In a small town well the word spreads fast
And the great nights have long since passed
And the future is whatever dad does
What you are isn't far from what he was
Cashed and crashed as the party winds down
The place is trashed but the sorrows drowned
And in the morning when I'm not around
For at least one night I'll be the talk of the town

For every drunken promise past, this time I'll make it last

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring
Down to wash away this boring
Town where no one left is scoring
That's how the story goes
Voices in my head start screaming
Seeing stars but I'm not dreaming
Sinking in this empty feeling
That's how the story goes

Same faces never seemed so old, same stories always being told
I'll add one last chapter to mine, out where the sun still shines

There goes the weekend, there goes the same old song
We kept singing but we got it wrong

Saturday night and the rain keeps pouring

Over at my house, I'm on the couch
You're on the TV, not here with me
That's a problem, we can figure out

So you can exit red carpet, enter drug rehab
When your looks go down the drain
And your career is through
Then I'll be there for you and you'll be there too.

Your movie's great, my life is hard
Why can't you see through the screen

You came from nowhere and I still live there
They say life's not fair but I don't care
If there's a problem with my master plan
Fate can take it up with somebody who gives a damn
'Cause I got a lot to offer you minus the rent
It's another clear reason why you're heaven sent
And I know I'm not the one that you've been waiting for
But I want you more than anyone before

Suffer through the tabloids seeing you and Mr. Right
Living out your picture perfect life
Gold up in the hills while this loneliness just kills
Staring up into your name that's on the sign

Your big shot just broke my dreams, my dreams

Do you remember, the way it used to be
Some summer, much younger
Way over the under pass
I thought those days would last

I'll travel time, flashback and make you mine, before your star shined

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

throwing wishes in well, no parachute
You were half way hot and I was kinda cute
Together forever till time came and severed
What ever we had then is coming round again

stone age 2nd round, Big Ben falling down, Model T turnaround, back in time
Long lost looking glass, afghan covered past, HG wouldn't last, back in time

Concrete buried deep, cobblestone back street, quantum physic leap, back in time
Crash land planet ape, rewind, great escape, I've got shotgun, back in time

I'll travel time, flashback and make you mine, before your star shined
And I rode the bench on life's sideline, count down 3, 2, 1

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you
A wrinkle in time way back when you were mine

I'll go back and find you and somehow remind you
The way that we were in the days far behind you

Bitter tears for a city's fate
Raise your voice in an ancient song

Hanging gardens with falling leaves
Temples robbed by the Persian thieves
Once this empire was standing strong
Say goodbye to Babylon

Never say never
Never forever
Always and ever
Always forever

Kingdoms dancing in nebu's dream
Ask the prophets what kingdoms mean
Count the battles our lord has won

From above holy angels fall
Paradise where we all come from
Say goodbye to Babylon

Trapped in a traffic accident

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""

I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

Attendre que passe le jour
Attendre qu'on vienne au secours
Des questions que je traîne
Et de ces envies qui m'enferment

Attendre ou bien rester couché
Assis, à genoux, à tes pieds
Aujourd'hui je m'en fous
Y'a qu'une façon pour que tourne la roue

Debout
Moi je prends mes quartiers
Je garde ma tête, ma liberté
Depuis que j'attends rien
Ni des étoiles ni des chiens

Debout je peux marcher
Même courir à m'épuiser
Mon histoire dans les mains
Je me sens bien
Je me sens bien
Je me sens bien
Je me sens bien

Attendre le téléphone
Attendre que quelqu'un me sonne
Pour me pendre haut et court
A la lumière d'un beau discours

Attendre qu'on m’assomme
Qu'on me prenne encore pour une pomme
Qu'on étale à mon nom
Sa confiture pour les cochons

Attendre ou rester à genoux
Attendre de prendre encore un coup
Avant de devenir fou
Y'a qu'une façon pour que tourne la roue

Debout
Moi je prends mes quartiers
Je garde ma tête, ma liberté
Depuis que j'attends rien
Ni des étoiles ni des chiens

Debout je peux marcher
Même courir à m'épuiser

Arnold Klos Trio,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Another year over, a new one just begun.

Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round

Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right

Havin' a celebration of sorts

Sisters have always fascinated me
The many shades, the many sizes and features
Such a wide variety of African women
Sometimes leaves me frustrated and speechless

Arrested Development,"Lately I've been in a life like limbo
Looking out of a smudged up window
We're not sure where our lives are going
Friends, it's summer outside but yet we're snowed in
Don't know where our next dollar's coming from
Living the life of a poor musician
Headliner's strong so he keeps his 9 to 5
Cutting brothers' hair as a means of staying alive
If it wasn't for the rhythm
I think we would have given up by now
This system has gotten the best of me
Now I pray for God to invest in me
My dignity, invest his glory
Give me the strength so I can finish the story
Keep on searching for the right way to go out
Coz going out is what it's all about
Huh! You can't be passive, gotta be active
Can't go with what looks attractive
Gotta learn all I can while I'm able
Headliner expresses his feeling on those turntables
When we get our chance
To make a good living of the music we program
We don't sell out just to be sold out
Brothers and sisters, do you know what I'm yapping about
Coz if they take away our contract
We still got talent and we still got contacts
Coz we're worked real hard to get this far
We were catching the bus before we bought the car

Political I gotta get
Grown but can't hold my own
So this government needs to be overthrown
Brothers with the AKs and the 9 MMs
Need to learn how to correctly shoot'em
Save those rounds for a revolution
Poor whites and blacks bumrushing the system
But I tell you: Ain't no room for gangstaz
Coz ganstaz do dirty work and get pimped by mobsters
Some fat Italian eating pasta 'n lobster
Brothers getting jailed and mobsters own the coppers
So you you want out of the ghetto
First the political prisoners must be let go
And you must let go of your power master
You'll never get out without much discipline
Raise your fist but also raise your children
So when you die the movement moves on
Coz with no revolution, ain't no future in front o' y'all
Haha yeah direct your anger, love
Nothing's ever built on hate, instead love
Love your life, tackle the government
The spooks that break down the door are heaven sent

I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal 

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law

I don't know where I can go to let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma past my brother's gone, I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel, not just my spare tire

(Home!) to be my guiding force and truth
(Home!) For some strange reason it had to be

Make me forget all that hurts me, let me understand your plan

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg and Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climb the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (Home)
Go back, from whence you came (Home)

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playin' ghetto games
I ask you, Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said, cuz I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me

Arrested Development,"Pebble by pebble
Sand grain by sand grain
Shore turns to sea
Shore turns to ocean
Serpent creates the high tides
To assure all good is floating
Good and righteousness is not intellectual
And the fabric that's good cannot be proven
And so that fabric is washed away
Far from the shore from which it was woven
The shore is a place where persons live
Sowing fabrics that's a tangent of the real one
Not wearable to most of the persons on shore
In fact, it's only wearable to the person of one
One person under an oath
An oath to a serpent, an evil snake
In search for being as powerful as God
And all God's good he'll try to take

He'll try to take
He'll try to take
Good being washed away
Love being washed away

Most of the persons follow the serpent
Cause the serpent preaches all for self
But why follow someone in search of something
When you'll get nothing
Serpent's all for self
Some are dumb, some know no better
Some believe there is no Lord
The serpent uses this knowledge to help him
And wash away more of the shore
Serpent knows once shores are gone
There's nothing left but ocean and sea
A few persons trying to save the shore
Some of those persons are A.D
Saving the shores means saving the faith
The faith that there is a mighty someone
Someone much more mighty than the serpent
In fact there's someone that created everyone
Up the ocean without a paddle
Is the fabric of God, the righteous clothing
And you wear non-righteous clothes of the serpent

Why are we allowing them to take what's good
Why don't we teach our children what's good
Why don't we collect and save what is real
Look very hard and swim the ocean
We must find what needs to be found
Look all around and find a wise man
To feed us the truth and keep us sound
All of us must swim the seas
Coz our path's been washed away
All of us must swim the seas
Cause our path's been washed away
My only purpose is to swim the seas

They're praising a God that watches you weep
And doesn't want you to do a damn thing about it
When they want change the preacher says ""shout it""
Does shouting bring about change ? I doubt it
All shouting does is make you lose your voice

Scared to put my line in that water

Naively so I give it another go

Just pray so you can see the pearly gates so white
The lady prays and prays and prays and prays
And prays and prays and prays and prays it's everlasting
""There's nothing wrong with praying ?"" It's what she's asking
She's asking the Lord to let her cope
So one day she can see the golden ropes
What you pray for God will give
To be able to cope in this world we live
The word ""cope"" and the word ""change""
Is directly opposite, not the same
She should have been praying to change her woes
But pastor said ""Pray to cope with those""

Coz they don't do a damn thing to try to nurture

It's raining solutions

It's raining revolution

The rain this time I feel is mental
The goal of this rain I feel is spiritual
Saw through the eyes of the inflicted people
Their eyes are hard as a million thombstones
Marked with the names of the millions of kin thrown
To the dust that gave them their colored skin
Fade to black is the scene they're embalmed in
The rain many nights have witnessed her
Receiving the sperm of a brother into a sister
And blessed that life to guaranteed existence
A conscious baby for a black resistance
I feel the rain enhances the revolution
And reminds us of a spiritual solution
And reminds us of an unnatural supernatural solu-lu-lu-lution

It's raining revolution

Lost between reality and psychology, 1990's mentality is described

my boys says she looks pretty fine body real firm
folds at her job loves her new touch up

But Africa keeps coming stronger-we found out
it ain't a perm it's a temporary

no money for the guitar or the violin or the tuba

I put the needle on the record and I kicked it crazy live
scratching it up catching the breaks
spirits within me had me do what it takes
Grammy's I win & one again like my Egyptian kin
it's Africa within makin' something outta nothing!

taking back her child
she's giving me my pride

what's that spirit makin'love to my daughter

allowing her the choice to twist her hair & make it lock.

Rather embracer of the jungle

you fool your subconscious into accepting it.
I ain't accepting it.  I keep my focus. I keep my focus.
I ain't accepting it. Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
and say my prayer to give my earthlybody inner peace.
And say my prayer to give my earthly body inner, inner peace

But I still know how to make you smile
The kind of smile that I'm talking about
Is the one that you do when no one else is around

And I'm dying to know
What makes your energy flow
And I'm dying to show you
What my heart already knows

Take my rest in your arms
No longer a test, now you're warm
Heard you speaking a softer word
Still can't believe the things that I've heard

Now I am racking my brain
Trying to figure the change

No one would really half cared

Feeding you like food, to a pool of Zulus
Singing the blues, sippinâ?? the booze, taking a bloodbath.

Rock Steady was a B-boy crew, but to me it's all about hip hop,
So, rock steady is a hip hop crew now.  Its about all four elements, And we 
represent those lovely, sratch pickers, arsonists,
All the b-boys that are down with us, the b-girls, we have some dope 
B-girls, and you know, we got graf artists like East and Zero T,
Its just straight up on skills, this is Crazy Legs from the Rock Steady 
Crew, I'm out

Hip-Hop was breaking, spray paintin' full train cars
DJ's cutting emcess presents the ghetto stars
I was the skinny shorty wop, with the bop in my step
Shams the bear and teloids, playboys and I was set
Running through the streets of the boogie with a bang
Pops was kinda strict, so at times I couldn't hang
But whateva the case, I stuck close to my hip-hop
Somethin' in my soul just kept that, on lock

And oppurtunity never knocked, but we was still open
Saying ish like fresh, like def (dope in)
And crack was on the corner rumblin' the dry goods
With something I decided never to persue in my hood
I was, too busy in the middle of the streets playing skelly
With Ray and Big Lou, listenin' to Flash and Melly
And rockin' block parties, seemed to be my route
But I had to give that up, they always ended in shoot outs

Hip-Hop was rhyming, hard timin', radio hits
No dats, so the D.J's was still in the mix
Grafitti and breaking took a back seat
Cuz the A&R's couldn't figure how to make they ends meet
I was the high school rapper to the girls in the hall
While my nigga Clarence Greer was slammin' with a basketball
Tune my radio on a saturday night
Daydreamin' 'bout grippin' mikes and being in the spotlight
Fat rope chains in a pair of A.J's in the p.j's frontin' like I had status
(what) who's the baddest?
The brotha on swinten ave, though fresh out the lab
You just couldn't tell Q-Unique what he couldn't have

It all started in Bushwick, defacin' the community
Around the way, all you saw was nothin' but graffiti
As a shorty I was poppin' never could I ever stand still
Always battlin' cuz it was all about the skills
Never learned windmills, but my boogie took me places
When I started emceeing, I kept it fat like my laces
Wrestlin' was the bomb, kept me from doing my homework
Radio was my thing, when red alert went bezerk

[Chorus] 4x's
Yes yes y'all, let me get some
Cuz we, never forgot where we came from",Flashback

Nine months passed, the water bag broke
Mad hours of hard labor, sweat, screams, tears, pains,
suffering, frustration, agony
Only brought us hate, love, anger,
happiness, doubt in faith, all in one, life begins now!

My congrats to the world
You have a beautiful healthy album
that contain a trillion bombs of head nod
to shock the outcome
Three men and a cd,
that conceived this through a spit guard
pilot pens and compositions
Hand out the the cigars
Place your right hand on the case,
and swear this shit is bangin
Happy birthday! We made it through pimps,
blingin and dancin
(Yo Q, I know you got something)

[Q-Unique]
(Yeah, no doubt, check it)
As the world burned
we took to embrionic state
Sonagram showed quintuplets
but that was a doctor's honest mistake
Rhymes fertilized the track
Initiate the transaction
Call for the legal assistance
to push through the contract-tions
The snare smacks you in the ass
You cry into a chorus
Cut the umbilical from the mic
and take the first steps with a cordless

""Where my dogs at?""  Now sit, rollover, obey your master

Annoying like the asshole behind the newsreporter makin funny faces

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

Art Blakey,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polkadots and Moonbeams

I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.

Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Though life is empty, since you have gone

Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me
Art Farmer,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Art Farmer,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes
Art Farmer,"Something you got, baby
Makes me work all day
Something you got, baby
Makes me bring home my pay
Something you got, baby
You ought to know

Something you got, baby
Makes the world go 'round
Something you got, baby
Keep me home every night

Art Farmer,"I am not such a clever one
About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it

Art Farmer,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands
Art Farmer,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Art Farmer,"Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you 
Just the way you look tonight

Mm, mm, mm, mm
Just the way you look tonight",Just the Way You Look Tonight
Art Farmer,"Your my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, 
You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical, 
Yet youÂ´re my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling? 
But donÂ´t change a hair for me, 
Not if you care for me. 
Stay little valentine, stay! 
Each day is ValentineÂ´s Day 
 
Each day is ValentineÂ´s Day",My Funny Valentine
Art Farmer,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

",Nobody's Heart
Art Farmer,"You're the only reason for my happiness
You're the one I'm always dreaming of
Just to show you what I mean by happiness
Let me paint a picture of my love

As beats the ocean surf upon the sand
So beats my heart for you
For just as constantly as sea meets sand
So beats my heart for you

I'll always be true
Faithful to you
Skies have been blue
Since you came in view

As beats the rhythm of a mighty band
So beats my heart for you, dear
So beats my heart for you

As beats a melody that Ella hums
So beats my heart for you
Just as exciting as the bongo drums
So beats my heart for you

With you standing there
I'm walking on air
Fell debonair
Just like Fred Astaire

As beats the drummer swinging in a band
So beats my heart for you

Just like the beat of the tom toms
The crashes of cymbals and such
Here is my heart and its pounding
Oh baby I love you so much

So beats my heart
So beats my heart
So beats my heart for you",So Beats My Heart for You
Art Farmer,"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!",Who Cares?
Art Farmer,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Art Farmer,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Art Farmer,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Art Farmer,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon
Art Farmer,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher

Art Ferrante,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Art Ferrante,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

We're the best of friends

And our way, is on the road again

Though the night is dark and the wind is wild,

The rain falls and the windows weep,
I'm standing by to sing a lullaby. 

Close your eyes my sister fair,
Though the snow is falling and the trees are bare.
And I will hold you by the hand,
Tonight there is nothing you need try to understand.
You can sleep now, go to sleep.

Art Garfunkel,"All in the merry month of May,
When green buds all are swellin'.
Sweet William on his deathbed lay for love of Barbara Allen. 

He sent his servant to the town,
The place where she did dwell in.
Saying, ""Master dear has sent me here if your name be Barbara Allen."" 

Then slowly, slowly she got up and slowly she went to him,
And all she said when there she came was, ""Young man, I think you're dying. 

""Don't you remember the other night when we were in the tavern?
You drank a toast to the ladies there and slighted Barbara Allen."" 

He turned his face unto the wall,
He turned his back upon her.
""Adieu, adieu, to all my friends.
And be kind, be kind to Barbara Allen."" 

As she was wandering on the fields she heard the death bell knellin'.
And every note, it seemed to say,
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!"" 

The more it tolled the more she grieved,
She bursted out a-crying.
""Oh, pick me up and carry me home.
I fear that I am dying."" 

They buried Willy in the old church yard and Barbara in the new one,
And from William's grave, there grew a rose, from Barbara's, a green briar. 

They grew and grew in the old church yard,
Till they could grow no higher,
And there they tied in a true lover's knot,
The red rose and the briar.",Barbara Allen
Art Garfunkel,"Down in the willow garden
Where me and my love did meet,
As we set there a courtin',
My love fell off to sleep.

I had a bottle of burgundy wine,
My love she did not know.
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below.

I drew a saber through her,
It was a bloody knife,
I threw her in the river,
Which was a dreadful sight.

My father oft had told me
That money would set me free

If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly.

My father sits at his cabin door,
Wiping his tear dimmed eyes,
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high.

The scaffold now waits for me,
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly.",Down in the Willow Garden

Nobody held her, nobody smiled.
She was born in a trailer, wretched and poor,
And she shone like a gem in a five and dime store.

Just famous faces pinned to the wall.
All of them watched her, none of them saw

Art Garfunkel,"She walks in the field that's just across the way
And picks all the flowers that brighten up a day.
And the blue velvet cape that she wore around her neck,
And the red in her cheeks gave a Rag Doll effect. 

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad song,
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long.
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me,
And bring back the Rag Doll to me. 

Oh, how I long to have her back here by my side.
The happiness of yesterday, it damn near cost my pride.
There ain't nothin' worse than losin' when you've everything to gain.
I've just got to get that woman back or nothing will be the same. 

The wind in the trees sings a sad, sad, sad, sad song,
I lie in my bed listenin' all night long.
A wind in the trees sing a song just for me,
And bring back the Rag Doll to me.
And bring back the Rag Doll to me.",Rag Doll
Art Garfunkel,"It's the same old tears on a new background
Seeing you as a fading photograph
It hurts too much to laugh these days
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right
It's the same old song with a new melody
But this old candle's lingering flame is almost gone
To see you again is all that keeps me hangin' on
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right

Remembering, remembering the familiar heartache
No one but you
It's the same old me crying the same old tears
And I walk away like I always do
Still in love with you
But I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right
All right",The Same Old Tears on a New Background
Art Garfunkel,"A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road,
It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone,
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun,
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun.
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush,
The nod of the wood, the song of a thrush,
The wood of the wing, a cliff, a fall,
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all.

It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of a slope,
It's a bean, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart.

The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone,
The beat of the road, a sling-shot stone,
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light,
The shot of a gun in the dead of the night.
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump,
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps.
The plan of the house, the body in bed,
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud.

Afloat, adrift, a flight, a wing,
A cock, a quail, the promise of spring.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart.

A point, a grain, a bee, a bite,
A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night,
A pin, a needle, a sting, a pain,
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain.
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe,
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart.

A stick, a stone, the end of the load,
The rest of a stump, a lonesome road.
A sliver of glass, a life, the sun,
A night, a death, the end of the run.
And the riverbank talks of the Waters of March,
It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart.",Waters of March (Aguas de Marรงo)

Art Garfunkel,"All my love's laughter
All my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms
She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
Who walks without shining a light
She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know til it's night

All my love's softness
All my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove
She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
Who stands with her flock
All alone on the hill
Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning, and you never will",All My Love's Laughter
Art Garfunkel,"I took a walk around the yard
I dug the flowers till it got too hard
Smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
Then I went down, down to Lucy's old cafe
I put a half a case away
Took a sleeping pill and I tried to watch TV
But you know baby, the leading lady
Looked too much like you for the likes of me

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the night stand
An the operator said ""Can I help you please?""
And I said ""No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me
You know I just had a bad dream""
That's all that's wrong with me
You see I just had a bad dream

Went out to loosen up the car
Somehow I wound up at the Rainbow Bar
I had a scotch and soda on the run
But I didn't get too far
I ran down some friends I used to know
I dragged them out to see the show
I ran myself a bath and I tried to read your book
But you know baby, this time it just didn't seem
Worth all the time it took

Or is it the pain
That makes all the puppet tears
Roll down your cheek
Or does the roof leak?

Marionette, how could you forget?
I told you your bright shining varnish
Would peel
And how does it feel
With the bright rouge all faded and
The smile almost cracked
Now that you've come back?

In the bright merry morning
She'll run and hide 
And leave you the paper promises 
Behind her as she runs across the square

You can't win the race, She'll set the pace
You will hear her laughing 
Just behind the foolish fences
Throw back the gate and find the 
Piece of paper lying on the curbstone, 
But the lady won't be there.

Later in the day, 
You'll be searching for a way 
To let her know you're ready 
For her little game to end
Cause it's getting dark, and then-

You'll see her face, a glimpse of lace
And you'll go running 
Through the last sweet dying daydream
Calling her name, but she's been home an hour,
Laughing at the mirror 
As she combs her paper hair.",Paper Chase

Where the street people come to play
And let the wine and the sunshine
blow our minds away

islands looking within
Sometimes I know it must seem like
we'll never be happy again

And I'll shine my shoes

bored with the blues

Move here and move there
And then she went homeward

And you'd, you'd freeze my spine.

Like a song half heard through a closed door
Like an old book when you cannot read the writing anymore

Pressed against the rainswept windy windows of my eyes
Like an antique etching glass design
That somehow turned out wrong

At my late lover's body
Caught on ancient canvas
And decaying...disappearing

Art Garfunkel,"Well the rain's fallin' down around you,
So you cry yourself to sleep.
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep.
You're feelin' lost and empty,
'Cause you gave yourself away.
But don't be ashamed to cry,
It's okay.
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
You keep searchin' for the reasons,
As you walk the lonely halls.
You wait by a telephone,
But he never calls.
Time's the only healer
For the broken hearts of glass
Love is like the wind it too shall pass
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.
I know what you're goin' through,
Every time you see his face.
And I don't know where or when,
But I know that you'll love again.
Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
Tomorrow's gonna be a brighter day.
Hang on.",Hang on In
Art Garfunkel,"Went to school In Cars, in our cars, pretty girls,
Cruisin' after the game, watchin' radio.
Let your baby know In Cars, restaurant mobile,
Two behind the wheel like double-neck guitars,
In our cars.
We fell in love In Cars, in a car at the show,
Silhouettes on the glass, memories in chrome.
Take your baby home In Cars, everything was warm,
What a perfect form underneath the stars,
In our cars
(I remember you, everything was new.
Talking in the dark, everything was true.)
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds.

Where the winds get heavy on the border line,
Remember me to one who lives there

And draws them to eternity.

I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me,
I Wonder Why.

I Wonder Why it is the sea's so calm tonight,
The sands are ghostly white
Beneath the moon.
It seems strange to me to stand in endless space,
And know that in this place
I'm held within its timeless sway.

I Wonder Why it is that you are here with me.
I Wonder Why.

The wisdom of the world with all its mystery
Is strangely haunting me on this great shore.
I know no book can teach, but I can feel tonight,
The sky above, the sea below,
And you my love.
Tonight the world is mine, we're on the edge of time.
I Wonder Why.
I Wonder Why it is the sky's so quiet tonight,

I found a new place to live my life.
It's really no place at all,

On Second Avenue.
And since our stars took different paths,
I guess I won't be shavin' in your looking glass.
Guess my old friendly grin,
Must have started to dim, somehow,
And I certainly don't need it now,
Still, I keep smiling through,
On Second Avenue.
I can still see you standing
There on the third-floor landing.
The day you visited we hardly said a word.
Outside it was rainin',
You said you couldn't be stayin,
And you went back to your flowers and your birds.
Since we can no longer see the light

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

Hide in the hiding place where no one ever goes.

It's a little secret just the Robinsons' affair. 
Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids.

Art Garfunkel,"The last train is nearly due,
The underground is closing soon,
And in the dark deserted station,
Restless in anticipation,
A man waits in the shadows.

His restless eyes leap and snatch,
At all that they can touch or catch,
And hidden deep within his pocket,
Safe within its silent socket,
He holds a coloured crayon.

Now from the tunnel's stony womb,
The carriage rides to meet the groom,
And opens wide the welcome doors,
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows.

And the train is gone suddenly.
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany,
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand.

Now from his pocket quick he flashes,
The crayon on the wall he slashes,
Deep upon the advertising,
A single-worded poem comprising
Four letters.

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding,
The poem across the tracks resounding,
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.",A Poem on the Underground Wall
Art Garfunkel,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Without no seam nor needlework
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Where she falls, nobody knows
Save your breath
Let those snake eyes roll

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
Let the light of love keep bouncing off
The diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an in articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me
There is a diamond in the dark

Catch that flame, let it warm your soul
Love's cruel game, is the great unknown
All that fear
Do you know you're not alone

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
We bounce between decisions, destinations constantly
Let the light of love keep bouncing off
The diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an in articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me
There is a diamond in the dark

A shine, a flash and then it's over
A lightning strike, a chance remark
Am I the only one here
Like a diamond in the dark
Like a diamond in the dark

Art Garfunkel,"I'm the kid who ran away with the circus
Now I'm watering elephants
But sometimes I lie awake in the sawdust
Dreaming I'm in a suit of light
Late at night in the empty big top I'm 
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine

Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true

That it would be alright for us that night

When we crossed over it was day

She opened the door
She opened her arms

And there from my car
I became your long way home

I was just your long way home

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl

You've made me break a many true vow

Art in Manila,"We make things better, we make things hard
A shelter of sorrow grows in the dark
Oh, how long must the soul survive
Under the weight of these haunted pines?

Set the woods on fire
Set the woods on fire, now

Like Randall Adams and the thin blue line
You're not guilty but you're doing time
Oh, how long must the soul endure
To find that silence is all you get for yours?

Set the woods on fire

Oh time, time gets us all

When our love was all we had
One kiss and the ocean
Swallowed us in the abyss

That was all you had to say
And now I found another love
And you say it was a mistake

Funny, but here's that rainy day

After it brought my lover near

Sing the Whiffenpoofs assembled with their glasses raised on high
And the magic of their singing casts it's spell

Yes, the magic of their singing of the songs we love so well
""Shall I Wasting"" and ""Mavourneen"" and the rest
We will serenade our Louie while life and voice shall last

Shall remain everyday in our hearts

Mauvaise poésie
D'ambiances surannées

Fait voler la poussière

J'ai vidé mon grenier
Sur un coup de colère
Appelé les chiffonniers

Art Mengo,"Que tu me quittes un jour de pluie
A quelques brises du printemps
Un dix-neuf mars avant minuit
Ou sous un soleil éclatant

Que tu t’en ailles un sale jeudi
Pianos, rhums cuivrés et regrets
Sur un lointain reggae maudit
Où les yeux dans les yeux tout près

Je passerai la main comme ça
Dans tes cheveux, sur ton visage
Pour dire qu’au plus profond de moi
Je t’aime au-delà des usages

Je passerai la main comme ça
Tu trouveras cela gamin
Mais c’est ma façon d’être à toi
Et puis je passerai la main

Que tu t’évapores un matin
Lendemain de nuit à rosée
Que je le sente venir d’instinct
Ou que l’on me cueille au lever

Que tu t’envoles ou prennes l’eau
Pour des aventures au grand air
Ou que l’on s’use au fil des mots
Dans deux, trois ans et des poussières

Art Mengo,"Il disait vous avez
Sans doute mieux à faire
Que de lire je le sais
Mes lettres ordinaires

Vous avez, il est vrai,
Mieux à faire de vos nuits
Que de lire sans arrêt

Mais permettez, madame,
Cet aveu déchirant,
Je suis sous votre charme
Comme un petit enfant.

Il disait dites-moi
Au moins « tu » une fois
Alors je serai comme
Le plus heureux des hommes.

Dans cette intimité
Seule connue de vous,
Vos lèvres de papier
Sauront me rendre fou.

Si le sommeil me fuit
Si j'ai peur de dormir
C'est qu'au fond de mon lit
C'est la mort qui soupire.

Il disait : arrêtez
De m'écrire chaque jour
Ce que vous me donnez
Pour moi est bien trop lourd.

Chaque mot que je trace,
Chaque mot que je lis
Porte en lui la menace
De rester incompris.

Vos lettres me font peur.
Leur bonté m'exaspère.
Vos rêves de bonheur
Sont des fruits trop amers.

Il disait c'est ainsi
Je ne sais pas y faire

Comme un célibataire.

Pour se retrouver un matin

Quand nous aurions pu nous surprendre
Il y a vingt ans, et sans attendre

J'aurais retenu mes cheveux
Pour que tes doigts glissent dedans,
J'aurais eu là ce que je veux
Avec ma rose entre les dents.

Mon bras aurait été plus fort
Pour t'accompagner sans efforts,
Te soutenir et t'enlacer.
Nous n'aurions pas eu de passé.

Je t'aurais aimée nuit et jour
Avec la lumière allumée,
Ni rides, ni poignées d'amour
Et la cigarette à fumer …

Pourquoi avoir perdu du temps ?
J'aurais pu t'aimer plus longtemps.
Pourquoi avoir perdu du temps ?

Si j'avais su que tu existais,
Contre le sort qui résistait,
Je t'aurais pistée et trouvée
Pour te sentir et t'éprouver.

Je t'aurais alors reconnue,
T'aurais enlevée au destin
Sans avoir peur de me voir nu
Pour nos érotiques festins.

Sûr, je n'aurais pas eu de toit
Mais j'aurais pu courir vers toi.
Te soulever vers le soleil.
Je n'aurais jamais eu sommeil.

J'aurais crâné, fait le cabot,
Tu te serais moquée de moi,
Du temps où j'étais toujours beau.
Tu m'aurais mis la bague au doigt.

Pourquoi avoir perdu du temps ?
Puisqu'on devait s'aimer autant.

Puisqu'on devait s'aimer autant,
Pourquoi avoir perdu du temps ?
Puisqu'on devait s'aimer autant ...

J'en veux à la vie et à Dieu
De nous avoir fermé les yeux,
De m'avoir volé en beauté.
De nous avoir fait poireauter.

Pourquoi tant d'années à pleurer ?
Avec toi je ris désormais.
Trop longtemps j'ai été leurré,
Au lieu de vivre, je dormais ...

Tu es venue me réveiller,
Me ravir et m'émerveiller,
Ouvrir ma porte et mes fenêtres.
C'est ton regard qui m'a fait naître.

Si j'avais su que je t'aimais,
Je t'aurais cherchée à genoux.

For they are treated just the same by fate.
Today a smile and tomorrow tears,
We're never sure what's in store,
So learn your lesson before too late, so

Be like I, hold your head up high,
Till you find a bluebird of happiness.
You will find greater peace of mind
Knowing there's a bluebird of happiness.
And when he sings to you,
Though you're deep in blue,
You will see a ray of light creep through,
And so remember this, life is no abyss,
Somewhere there's a bluebird of happiness.
Life is sweet, tender and complete
When you find the bluebird of happiness.
You will find perfect peace of mind
When you find the bluebird of happiness.

And you must sing his song, as you go along,

I still think about the way you smile
It tears me apart to know that it won't ever be the same again
No it won't ever be the same again

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said ""so long""
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long

Not really sure what I'm doing back here
Why I stayed away for all those years
I guess I had to try to find myself
I'm the only one to blame
No one else can ever make it all go away
Or make up, make up for all my mistakes

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said ""so long""

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said ""so long""
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long

If I could do this all over
I'd want to go back, I'd want to go back
If I could only start over
I'd take it all back,
I'd take it all back for you
I'd take it all back for you

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry I said ""so long""

And I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry I said ""so long""
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long

That I waited so long",Sorry
Art of Dying,"The first time's easy I could walk away, but something in me makes me stay
The second I leave you I'm without
Third time lucky without a doubt this disease is growing in me from a seed into a twisted tree

It's like an obsession, an addiction
You keep on running straight across, straight across my mind

You're straight across my mind (my mind)

Art of Dying,"He's just a kid on the street
Got it tough, try to make ends meet
So high on low self-esteem

I pass him by every week
Offer change, hope he forgives me, but
Will I ever know his name?

Will I ever know
Is the whole world crazy now?
The whole world's crazy now?
I don't wanna believe there's no way out
Is the whole world crazy now?

He stole her innocence, fled the scene
Disowned by a daddy who drinks
They found her dead by the bathroom sink
Will I ever know her name?

I see your face, even with my eyes shut
I see your face, but will I ever know?

I see your face, even with my eyes shut

Art of Dying,"Late at night
I wake up from the cold
Another fight yeah
Yeah we broke the mold

You were right
But I needed you to know
All I want is everything

I hit the streets
So I can clear my head
Under the heat
Of neon red
I'm three sheets
But I meant every word I said
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

I won't give up until this feelings over
I've had enough of drinking myself sober
I really want to let you know
Never want to watch you go

When push comes to shove will we survive
Is there enough when you look into my eyes

Dark enough to search my soul

Morning comes
Thought I'd never see the sun
But dragonfly you've always been the one
I won't give

Become the breath of my day
That I breathe like a ghost

I'm like noise in the street

With all the noise and the fray
But no definite way

That I was a mess that looked neat

There was no place to start with

And a sea of hands couldn't reach

And that's why I don't
I don't keep a record
Because there's too much looking back as it is
And if I do it on occasion

Well then the saddest thing's not what you felt

now that the days pass like hours
and they come and they go just like nobody knows
i’m kicking and spinning in air
and getting nowhere
nowhere near the somewhere where you’re there
so now i have lost patience

just how hard i tried 
to give you sunshine

was moonlight

To justify complete wastes of time
And throw ourselves like rubbish out into the night

You say I have no reason for leaving you say I have nowhere to go
You say I have not one good reason but reasons are all that I know
There's not one thing that I will be taking
There's nothing that I want to remind
I'll probably even run just to make up some time
I've got to find a place I can go where 
Time is not something that I need
I just want my place in that starry night

We will become two people time has undone
And so it quietly is true 
You have this need for something new

And when I see you move under certain light
Lost in visions of us both in the night
Its not so easy just to see you away

Waves of fire sick with flame
Waves of water form the ocean's blame

Just to see you go that way
Lost from sight and then seen again
Your one true wave
Your one true way

It always takes you back to the same place
With every minute a mystery
Every day was a tragedy
Yeah all and every single one

And every minute I spent with you
Another minute that I could use
To show you why our time was done
'Cause I lost you somewhere along the run

Farewell the chance that you could be the one
Try not to feel let down
Get filled up with the pouring rain

Have left you without hope
You're caught between the way and not knowing the way
And you don't know which you need the most
You're listening for the distant waves
And watching all the stars coming down
The kind of things you do when you think that nobody wants to see you around
And I can see it in your eyes 
Like I can see it the skies of these constant, turning days
And I can feel it like a curse
Yeah it's only getting worse
It's never too far away

They pulled you from the crying water
They took you to the broken ground
The kind of thing you do to a person when you don't wanna see them around

If you're looking for a clean heart
Looking over this way
Is not a very good start
Been hanging on an old line
Been living in a fixed time
Been sticking to the same moves
And now I'm busted broken forgotten
Old and worn and used
It's OK I know it now
And there's nothing like the truth
In anything that I can still do
In anything that I can still be
If there's a part of me that's still true
It's trying to promise what I cannot prove
So in the daylight you will see me
As not a definite or real thing
Just as a shadow left to shifting
Now that I'm busted broken forgotten

Lost beyond all use
It's OK I know it now
And there's nothing like it
False signs and faulty lines well they may be excused
But how will time forgive me all the damage that they'll do?
So baby I'm leaving yeah I'm packing up and moving away
You'll never see me the broken boy is leavin' today
And you'll never find me from the the pieces scattered all along the way
Cause they're bound to fade
Now that I'm busted broken forgotten
Lost beyond all use
It's OK I know it now
And there's nothing like the truth

Wish I'd been there wish it had been me as well
Shown colours all so new

And I could hope for hell to follow you
I guess your heart turned grey

Art Pepper,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

It is seldom that a dream comes true,

That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Art Pepper,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Everytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm
Moaning and groaning tried to make him feel manly

I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice

I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices running like a river slowly down my kitty litter

Boy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say - oh
Hope he feel as strong as my pohah do
With you by my side its like I'm drunk off booze

The way you wind and you wind and you grind
Don't stop the way you work your stick

Art Porter,"Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion 

Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart 

I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart",Send One Your Love

And nothing's gonna come between us again.
Forever love I feel you with me
You're the sun that chases away the rain
I cherish all the love you bring
It's you forever and a day,
I love you more than anything 
I can't throw that away my love.
 
There's nowhere, Baby, unless you're here.
I could never let you down
By the way, I have wanted to say, 
I will always be around forever, love.
 
Inside my heart you'll never die,
you understand the man that hides deep inside.
So come to me I need you dearly
I'll never give you reason to say goodbye
There were times I made you cry 
and times I wasn't there for you,
But for our love I'd even die 
by you I'm gonna stay
 
There's nowhere, Baby, unless you're here.
I could never let you down
By the way, I have wanted to say, 
I will always be around forever, love.
 
You know girl, being with you
Has brought new meaning in my life
You give me so much happiness
Just to see you smile, gives me
The strength to go on
I cherish all the moments
We spend together, the laughter
The tears, they're all special to me
I guess what I'm really trying to say is that
I love you

For all the times we shared together
For all we've been through, Forever love

Art Porter,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rags on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just slicking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
Too early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just snaking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound",Lake Shore Drive

Up off the ground
I can show you
How to fly and never
Ever come back down

Is what I need

It's much to late if you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone

But hold your head up high and let your spirits fly
Keep hope alive yes deep inside and your dreams will never die

Oh take a breath, close your eyes you're on the road again
And then you realize they've brought you back to life again
Something's never change but if you fantasize 
You'll feel it deep inside yourself and then you'll realize

When you feel it coming
When you hear the sound
You'll always laugh when you want to cry
And then you'll know it deep inside

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Art Tatum,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head
Art Tatum,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Art Tatum,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Art Tatum,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Art Tatum,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time

Dry land may turn to sea but there'll be no change in me

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours

Art Tatum,"You're the only reason for my happiness
You're the one I'm always dreaming of
Just to show you what I mean by happiness
Let me paint a picture of my love

As beats the ocean surf upon the sand
So beats my heart for you
For just as constantly as sea meets sand
So beats my heart for you

I'll always be true
Faithful to you
Skies have been blue
Since you came in view

As beats the rhythm of a mighty band
So beats my heart for you, dear
So beats my heart for you

As beats a melody that Ella hums
So beats my heart for you
Just as exciting as the bongo drums
So beats my heart for you

With you standing there
I'm walking on air
Fell debonair
Just like Fred Astaire

As beats the drummer swinging in a band
So beats my heart for you

Just like the beat of the tom toms
The crashes of cymbals and such
Here is my heart and its pounding
Oh baby I love you so much

So beats my heart
So beats my heart
So beats my heart for you",So Beats My Heart for You
Art Tatum,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?
Art Tatum,"Maybe he's not much, just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man
She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him
When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man
Tel I her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Art Tatum,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Art Tatum,"Well, baby, what I couldn't do
With plenty of money and you.
In spite of the worry that money brings.
Just a little filthy looker buys a lot of things.
And I could take you to places that you would like to go.
But outside of that, I've no use for dough.
It's the root of all evil,
Of strife and upheaval.
But I'm certain, honey, that life would be sunny
With plenty of money and you.

Art Tatum,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

And you feel like steppin' out

Oh, you've got to spiel it
Let me off uptown

Not to have you in my arms

Tell me what am I to do?

If I could hate you
I'd keep away

Someone's calling, no reply
Nightshade's falling, hear him sigh

Chloe! Chloe!

Empty spaces in his eyes
Empty arms outstretched, he's crying

Through the black of night
I've got to go where you are
If it's dark or bright
I've got to go where you are

I'll go through the dismal swampland
Searching for you
For if you are lost there
Let me be there, too

Through the smoke and flame
I've got to go where you are
For no ways can be too far
Where you are

Ain't no chains can bind you

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
'Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today

Art Tatum,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

To the Mississippi
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems,
Or just how much it really means

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing

When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view

Hearing words that I have never heard
