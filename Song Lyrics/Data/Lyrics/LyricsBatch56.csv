DevilDriver,"Only the Gods know
They're looking right through you
Straight into the eyes of a dead man
There isn't enough hours in the day

What will be seen
When your world comes crashing down?
Staring in the eyes of a gone man
No more fuckin' time left on your side, on you side

All of your hopes and dreams, don't mean shit
All that's left is now to nowhere
I believe do anything at all costs
You must believe not all who wander are lost

Tied to the tree of woe, so woe to you
In front of the man with the dead eyes
With a choir of faith, there's still hell to pay

Not enough hours in the day
Hell of patience to be paid
So who's left to wonder?
In the wake of destruction, get made

All of your hopes and dreams, never meant shit
All that's left is now to nowhere, no
I believe do anything at all costs
You must believe not all who wander are lost, what?

Something, somewhere, injects the eye
Texas nights defines the sky
",Not All Who Wander Are Lost
DevilDriver,"Pleading your case while taking the eternal high ground

[Incomprehensible]
Havoc on the airwaves I'm listening
Don't see any daylight glistening
Long for the home, I left yesterday
Those memories slowly decay

Two highways, the fork in the road
Which one to take? Through the middle they rode

These fighting words deserve exile, banished
Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible, right

Fucking feast for the eyes
Believe now, beast killer arise
In my opinion this dominion is mine
Banished, days gone awry

These fighting words deserve exile, banished
Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible
These fighting words deserve exile, banished
Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible

These fighting words deserve exile, banished
Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible
These fighting words deserve exile, banished
Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible

Damn, goddamn invincible
Goddamn invincible, unbelievable
",These Fighting Words
DevilDriver,"Reaping the wind through this mortal shell
In the wake of destruction this will not fail
Walking with shadows defined by my suffering
Feeding the spirit through divine intervention

Out of the fire, so much for compassion
I've thrown it to desire, in time you'll hear

Tirades of truth
Glazed and angry eyes
Spoken to by the breath of Gods
In the valley of death's decision
The judgment, listen

The last kind words ever said will be
You will live below angels and above beasts

It's seldom clear, the roads to temptation
Are filled with such peril but the human spirit can soar
It's more than we can ever be in one lifetime
We need more to become gods ourselves

Tirades of truth
Glazed and angry eyes
Spoken to by the breath of Gods
In the valley of death's decision
The judgment, listen

The last kind words ever said will be
You will live below angels and above beasts

Temptation

Even the heavens aren't innocent [Incomprehensible]

Tirades of truth
Glazed and angry eyes
Spoken to by the breath of Gods
In the valley of death's decision
The judgment, listen

The last kind words ever said will be
You will live below angels and above beasts
Above beasts, above beasts, above beasts
And above beasts and above beasts
",Tirades of Truth
DevilDriver,"The blood thirsty, born on the wind
Hellbent, outside looking in
Voices that carry on nightly
Don't ask, just go in now blindly

I'm bloodshot, thrown away goods
Venomous, so fucking ruthless
A well of anger to be avoided

Extended forgiveness and then got bit
They call it the breaking point
When it comes to faith, this time you've quit
You call it the breaking point

Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned

Nothing's ever set in stone
Wade through, harvest seeds you've sown
It's alright, right as rain
And as far as I'm concerned, fuck the fame

I'm bloodshot, thrown away goods
Venomous, so fucking ruthless
A well of anger to be avoided

Extended forgiveness and then got bit
They call it the breaking point
When it comes to faith, this time you've quit
You call it the breaking point

Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned
Stand up against the gates and be counted
Counted when summoned

Climbing, scratching uphill
So breathless, lifeless, able still

Long live this short life a trouble
Long live this short life
Long live this short life a trouble
Long live, long life, long live, long life
",When Summoned
DevilDriver,"Laying down the law, listen to the hammer
Mouth of madness, watch the wicked gather
Streets of stone, underneath the grey skies
Nights come, they speak of devils in disguise

DevilDriver,"From counted out to feared, some say
That I'm back with a vengeance, I never left
I smell your fear, cause I'm back with a vengeance

Bruised tattered and torn, if it's punishing
Overtimes even the score

Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!
Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!

One foot in Hell, up on the highway
Now I'm back with a vengeance, no matter what I've said
The vendetta's not dead, I'm back with a vengeance

Bruised tattered and torn, if it's punishing
Overtimes even the score

Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.

DevilDriver,"Turn your tired eyes home, put the sword to stone
Death by boredom, the reach man bears the burden
That the poor man seeks to chase
The chase is certain

Did not see it coming, better stand for something
They're wicked as they come, break the cycle
Racing down the flames, while building the coffins
Iron unbroken, break the cycle

It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow 
It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow 

I've broke the cycle, after all these years
Death by boredom, not afraid to reveal
What the world is sensing, the chase is certain

Did not see it coming, better stand for something
They're wicked as they come, break the cycle
Racing down the flames, while building the coffins
Iron unbroken, break the cycle

Did not see it coming, better stand for something

With a pride it's going worldwide
It's spreading worldwide
Across the great divide

With a pride it's going worldwide
It's spreading worldwide

Healer, believer
On the bended knee, when push comes to shove
Healer, believer
Time and time again, you push me too far

DevilDriver,"Thirty third degree, on the corner of Quit Street and Temptation Avenue
On the road to redemption, outside of heave
Pride can be dangerous and you knew
Method of execution, length of duration
At what cost?

Forgiveness is a six gun, teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target, forgiveness is a six gun

The streets from the start, have been filled with doubt
And they are set free, you needed someone to carry you
Fighting and counting the days, the error of your ways
Methods of execution, length of duration, at what cost?

Forgiveness is a six gun, teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target, forgiveness is a six gun

In cold blood, dressed in black
Tombstones and tumbleweeds
Left the dead behind, watched em falling
Let Smith and Wesson do the motherfucking talking

Dust in my eyes, dust in the street, shotguns and broken dreams
Now we left the dead behind, watched em falling
Let the Smith and Wesson do the motherfucking talking

DevilDriver,"Death rides a horse full force, burning bridges
Put asunder, this I'm under
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue

Sing you sinners silent thunder
The joy of rapture, riding the bullet
It can't be captured

Easy money consorts with easy virtue

No methods to their madness
It's gonna be a long hot winter

DevilDriver,"Lord I miss the highway, running against the wind
Blessed are the stoned, and all the places they've been
Shadow of a man at home, beating a dead horse
Home too long, cross to bear

Methods of the past mold the future
You can't fall short as you get older
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link

I've been sober thirteen days and seven nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway

Echoes in the dark, new faces bring the sun
Comfort and disturbed, always think the worst
You live and die by your own decisions
You live and die by your own religion

Being run around is being trapped
Seized up, kept!

Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link
Link by link by link
I've been sober thirteen days and seven nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway

DevilDriver,"Between the head and the hands, must surely be an heart
Time and space is an illusion for man
One foot in the grave and one to start
Walking against the wind, living by the night

It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!

Got scars in bars (knife fight)
Broke bones in arms (ducked a gunfight)
It's hunters moon and I'll be gone soon
You stare like a goat with a twisted smile

There's another motherfucker wants a fist fight
Bringing knives to a gun fight

We're all thick as thieves sometimes, and I know it ain't right

Spitting venom, I've been a hunter!

I was on probation, you were on parole,
When you're wrong, you're wrong, you know!
To err is Human, to forgive divine,
What's yours is yours, what's mine is mine!

[Chorus]
Life is hard,
No one makes it out alive!
Seek higher ground!
No matter how bad it gets,
There's someone worse off than you!
Seek higher ground!

Men are evil, all men are vain!
Pride dies first, within the grave!
Worries are wasted, all cares put to ease
As the claw scratches us like fleas!

Blood of the dog, a man is not a man
Without blood on his hands
These scars I've earned, I've earned on my own
Distant memories, away from home

[Chorus]

The world goes by,
You've gotta make it alone now!
Put that shit on the shelf and become a man!
Work hard, count only on yourself!
Seek higher ground!

The world never fought for me!
In fact it's been heartless 'til the end.
With everyone helping me go down,
And all the misery that's around!
My blind vision!
You'll all dead by morning!
My blind vision!
Now all the blood is pouring!

Disavow everything that they're about!

With the Kangol sneakers with the wide shoe strangs
Wonderin' where he from and how he do thangs

His eyes stayed red but he kept his mind clear
The brothers knew he wasn't from no where round here
And the girls kept whisperin' in each others ear
It seems they didn't care about the smell of the beer

They was all on his thing a couple of 'em tried to grab it
Takin' their chances didn't know of his bad habits
A two timin' cheat and quick to make up a lie

Porgy turn a simple party into an orgy
And just when they thought
That they was the one that he chose

He get rid of them quick and get so mo
No time for lames, it's a shame what he do to women
His mouth spit game like a snake shootin' venom
And after he hit 'em some claim that he's no good

But they stick wit' him guess the pain feel so good
Take what he can get givin' up nuttin' why

Caressin' 'em, kissin' 'em, freakin' 'em

But last Friday night oh this what I heard
Outside his driveway parked a thunderbird
Georgy, couldn't hear nothin' but the headboard knockin'
Looked up and saw a strange woman in the window watchin'

Didn't know if it was Tina, Tenae or Toila
But whoever it was they had a gray revolver
They asked no question just start bustin'
George was in shock couldn't say or do nothin'

He just laid there stiff lookin' froze
And all he could think about was I got too many hoes
In the bed wit' no clothes just waitin' to die

Devin the Dude,"(2 guys talking about Devin)

Man.  They got him in the office again, man.
Yeah, I know.  He's been in there for an hour already.
And ya know, I kinda feel bad for the guy.
Damn, what do you mean.  The fucker clocks in drunk.
Man, it's his wife and kids; that's who you need to feel sorry for.
Yeah, I know.  And ya know, what are they gonna do if he loses another job.
Fuckin' alcy.  Fuckin' pothead.
He owes me $5 anyway.

Verse 1:

On my way to the job
Drunk than a bitch
I'm late for work again
Damn, boss goin' have a fit
He said, ""This shit been going on
For just too damn long
I need to go and find some help
Or take my drunk ass home""
And I really don't want to quit
Because see then I can't sit
Up on my ass and smoke my grass from unemployment checks
And I admit, when I wake up
I hit the drank, I blow up
But in back of the job
I don't bother no one
I stay strictly to myself
Co-workers know I be blowed
So they say my production is throwed
And I'm not carrying my load
So I go, and share my problems
With my friends who be
Just as high as I
As they pass the doobie to me
Who we be, fucked up fool, drunk, blowed, bent
When it's time to pay my rent
My money's damn near spent
I know I'm fucking up my lungs
My liver ain't 'bout shit
From all the weed
And all the alcohol
But y'all, I can't quit

(2 guys talking)

Man, if it was me dog, I'd say, ""Fuck that job"".
Man, here.  Hit the weed, man.  Fuck a job, man.
Shit, I'll hit that.  Here, I'll hit it.
Shit, no weed goin' never tell you nothin' wrong.
I've been tellin' you to quit that motherfuckin' job anyways.
Yeah, that boss trippin', on my dick anyways.
Fuck that nigga.  Hell fuck yeah.
Want me to kick his ass for you?
Fuck it man.

Verse 2:

See, reefer's like a friend
Who free me from my foes
Drinking something different today
But wearing the same old clothes
I guess weed, wine, and women
Was the life that I chose
But it got hard splitting my dick
Between my wife and these hoes
So I just smoke
An ounce a day, nothing less
Spent so many damn dollars
That it don't make no fucking sense
I went to seek help
Thought I was losing my mind
The doctor walked in high
With some brew and a dime
And said, ""It's your life, nigga
Go ahead and enjoy
And whenever you need some weed, nigga
Just hollar at your boy
'Cause ain't nothing wrong with it, go on on
Take these, you need at least 3 cups in the morning""
Drinking all day
Big chiefing at night
I keep my eyes red and tight
So that my teeth can look white
And I can smell it and tell it
The weed you have ain't shit
But I'll still take a pull
And twist the cap on the bull
I can't quit

(Devin and his doctor talking)

Damn, doctor.  Is this shit gonna kill me, man?
No, no son.  No need to panic.
It's actually quite good for you.
It slows down the structure of white blood cells
And cures the flow.  It's called nature's illing leaf.
The more you smoke it the better you feel.  Take another hit.
You ain't bullshittin'.  You did good.
Would I lie to you?

Verse 3:

Just another day
Another fat sweet to get my head right
I'm sitting back, my windows cracked
I'm chilling at the red light
Minding my business
But why is this law typing my plates
I only gotta dime and ain't got time to catch no case
But still she races up to me
And stick her nose out in my car
""Hey bitch, what you looking in my car for?""
She pointed at the sweet
Still burning and said, ""Aw""
I had to think quick
Pulled out my dick
And shoved it in her jaw
But like weak times
I had to hit the gas
Collect my seeds
Clean the ash
Non-stop, evade the cops
They mad because I'm high they not
I made the block, screwed up some cop
Dipped back on the freeway
Threw my empty 40 bottle out
When I passed San Felipe
We stay blowed, fucked up, drunk, full, bent
My kids screaming Astroworld
But all my time is spent
And you can tell the way I smell
My braincells ain't shit
From all the weed and all the alcohol
But y'all, I can't quit

(2 guys talking)

That was cool, man.  Hey, can I get one of those dranks?
Naw, man.  I told you about your beer-hoggin' ass.
Nigga, go to the fuckin' store.
c'mon, man.  Can I drink with y'all, man?
I can't hear.  Goddamn, I can't hear shit.
(...?...)
Do you have a job?  Do you have a job?
Hell yeah, I gotta job motherfucker.
I just spend all my money buying weed.
Ya know, it helps me work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed",I Can't Quit

Hey motherfucker it's me again yep
The one who fucked your sister but quiet is kept
Because she burnin' but instead of cussin' out the bitch
Just didn't tell her then let her suck the puss up out my dick
Gave me some money for gas I hopped out on 59
Smokin' weed (weed)
And feelin' fine
Dick suckin' laws right behind and they look and they stare
But I got on my seat belt so I don't care
""How the fuck you doin' today Mr. Officer?
If I had the time I wouldn't mind to offer ya
A fat dime and a black nine in my shit 
But no warrants and tight insurance so you can just ride the fuck on bitch""

Drankin' alcohol keeps me peein' white piss
Parents I'm not tellin' your children to smoke ya see
Cause if they just say no it be mo fa me

Scratching ""Mo fa me""

They got bounty hunters lookin' for me I'm wanted for theft
Women claim that I came and got they pussy and left
I'm not an old fool from the old school like My Adidas
Cause All Day I Drink And Smoke it's like I need it
On stage you can boo you can hiss real loud
But I'll just pull out my dick and take a piss in the crowd
Then I'll smile take a bow put down my mic and I'll leave
Get the money from the promoter hope it's enough for some weed
Head dead to the back with the VIP status
In a room full of Pimps tryin' to find 'em a Gladis
Gotta pick one of 'em get one of 'em stick one of 'em quick
Cause they niggas might be here they niggas might be talkin' shit
They niggas always somewhere they ain't supposed to be
Niggas can't keep up with they pussy then it's mo fa me

Verse 3:
Son said ""Daddy I don't want to go to school
Cause the teachers a freak she tittie dance on the coo
And all my friends smoke reefer 
I think it might be cheaper
If I buy a couple of pounds and sell 'em ounces and threefers""
Cause any way to come up I got to do it ch'all
I'm havin' flashbacks I'm about to stash crack in my drawers
But fuck the laws
They got my brother already they can suck my balls
Average nigga have no luck at all
But have no other choice but to take up the bet 
Tryin' the seven or eleven when I come out and pick up a check
Gotta get my shit fixed 
Hit a quick liquid
Fringe  benefit, like gettin' my dick licked 
Cause this money runnin' funny gonna break before I'm broke
And I can't be wakin' up in the mornin' nothing to smoke
So I think I'll smoke half and roll some sweets
Well I can't smoke I'm a sell it

Tellin me how they suck dick and swallow the nutt (they gobble it up) 

I thought I told you about one of them hoes 

I put my foot inside her pussy and took it out and suck my toes 

Yo, don't forget to stop and get some fuckin duncoms, condoms 

Forget them nigga we got a problem 

[Devin] 

That ain't no problem man, you know we must cover our bones 

Zoom zoom bust in the room get bout two and I'm gone 

And as soon as I get there I'm gonna spit some game to her 

Get the pussy so quick you think I already knew her

Finally, at last Devin showed up 

And the first thing this muthafucka said was........(Devin finishes

[Devin] 

What the fuck is this thick neck big bitch here 

Man I should a bought a 16 ounce beer

How in the hell we gonna get these two big bitches in the pool 

[K.B.] 

Ha Ha Ha, you fool, stop trippin and just take your clothes off 

Cause all pussy feel the same when the lights go off 

[Devin] 

Man that's too much pork 

For just one fork 

And I'll pass 

You can't even tell the difference between the stomach and they ass 

Stretch marks on they titties like a road map 

Hoe slapped, on some mabaline 

[K.B.] 

But she keep her navel clean 

And at least these hgoes big and cute not big and fucked up 

You done fucked a skinny ugly ass hoe so nigga what's up 

Don't give a fuck if you fuck these broads nobody knows 

So just drank and smoke this dank and lets fuck these hoes

I grab a Swisher Sweet and use my fingernail to cut it 

Gut it  then I dump the droppin' out then stuff it full of coffee 

And if you don't know by now coffee is kilo 

In other words weed a fat dime is a pillar 

Now the buds on the stems are like trees in an orchid 

Anybody in the room who don't smoke weed is gettin' torch lit 

By the smoke niggas choke niggas cough and they fart

Devin the Dude,"[Chorus]
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you want to smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you want to take a pill but ya end's all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way

You probably don't have a big ol house on the hill
But if you did just imagine how it would feel
If your phone got disconnected, no cash, and ya gas cut off
And the gal that you had that was helping just stepped the fuck off
She took the kid, the dog, and the kitty
And everybody know you're at a low they feel pity
And what's really fucked up is now you're just normal
No more hoes, no more clothes, can't go to the show 'cause it's formal
And you wonder why why why why why
And you resort to gettin high
But damn, you can't find ya stash
And you never took the time to ask yourself

[Chorus]
You probably don't have a lot of money
But if you did would you find it funny
If you lent, and you spent it, and you didn't invest
Or put it in the bank so we can gain some interest
You just went and copped the biggest car you could find
And a couple more just like it so your friends could follow behind
Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat
You got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke (damn)
And the yacht that you got, it won't sail or float
You look back and try to catch someone's attention for help
You made a right at the light and they made a left and you ask yourself

[Chorus]
Why they do me that way
Yeah
Hey hey hey
Ain't no more doobies in the tray
What you gonna do when the people go home (home home home)
want to smoke some weed but the reefer's all gone (gone gone gone)
What you gonna do when your friends go home
And you want to take a pill but your end's all gone (gone gone gone gone)
All gone",Doobie Ashtray
Devin the Dude,"Yeah
This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway
Check it out

Sittin in the next room talkin softly on the telephone
Makin plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peek it, loc, here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think ehm, Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin, illin, riffin, trippin, she gave my face a smack
Now she's got a busted lip and says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin at the crib by my goddamn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin my back tryin to suck my own dick

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin on
Everytime I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin and shit when she left at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months and when she call all she do is talk cold to me

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy",Fa Sho

And try to see if I could fly
I know I can't but still 
I drink and smoke that kill
I'm real, I chill, I fucked a gal
Who had to tell mine, guess that was just my luck
Sluts, hoes, bitches, tramps, all of the clits get down
When it comes to certain purchases they can't go get with stamps
But before I got a chance to learn I got caught up
The bitch got high, then my name was brought up
Fucked my whole game up, told the whole hood
Tried to go back to the crib and get pussy - no good
I shoulda known it, blowin it like she owned it
Now the phone clicks and damn, my gal is gone, shit
A hard lesson to learn, now I'm just finna turn
This curb and go buy some herb and try to wet my worm
With some bitch who don't even know my muthafuckin' name
It's a shame, shame, shame

It's a shame when you're left out
And you're runnin' all over town
Am I to blame, am I the only one
To pick myself up after fallin' down
When I try, tryin' so hard
To keep my feet on solid ground
So many people comin'into my life with bullshit in my ear
Steadily irkin' me, won't you stop workin' me

People walkin' by, ""Hey D, have you seen...?"" No
I'm by myself and alone
And if it's bullshit I gotta listen to, man, gone
Don't even like to go but when I show at a club
I be lookin' for pussy, seldom searchin' for love
But I fucked up again and I went once mo'
Wasn't tryin' to find a bitch but stumbled upon a hoe
So me and this bitch who didn't even know me
Left the curb so she can serve me, wanted to show me
A nice quiet private place no one would know
I rolled somethin' to smoke, she had somethin' to blow
But then them laws, though, they had us fucked in the game
Charged the bitch for prostitution, charged me for the caine
It's a shame

The things that'll make you laugh
Can be the same things that make you cry (cry)

Devin the Dude,"We need to change our ways
Doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, getting high
Chasing freaks, feeling fine
Its just the same old shit
But I think we ain't gone quit
Makin' a rhyme, climbing the hill
Staying alive, just tryin' ta live

It's a constant struggle, but brothers gotta keep climbing
People be thinking this shit is simple and simon
Lookin' at my wrist to see the position that I'm in
Kinda clothes I'm wearing, the type of car that I'm drivin'
I been strivin'
With damn near nothing to fight with
Flashlight, nightstick, ain't no blowin' up right quick
Type shit, I just write shit, hopin' it might hit
So I can make a living, but there some who don't like it
But I.. I really don't give a motherfuck 
A nigga's tryin' to get another buck
The legal way that people say what they want em 
But I'm gonna, smoking drinkin' fuck with these freaks
Til I find one life with mona
On a mission 
Every day wishin' and prayin'
can't be kidding and playing
Fast break missing the laying
So what you saying?

Man we need to make these beats, fuck these freaks, fire these sweets

Constantly asking me to change my ways
But the way I'm acting now is the way I'm acting since the first day
But the sumas to Vics smoke blunts significant others man
Ya'll can't stop the jump up for pound with these brothers
It's a rough long climb up the hill to the top
Giving it all that we got 
As we proceed to wreck shop
And it's the same shit, ain't shit changed since 94'
You see the scorn left the scene
And paid the circle back to let you know
Gotta get my paper bro
If I can't I'ma let it do
We coming back for mo, and kicking the hinges off your door.
(kickin the hinges off your door)
And life is so lunt slunt
Reality hits bluntly
Amongst all these issues we grind, cause the rents due monthly
But everything you do is certain consequences
I know there is more than this is a Piz and he's three dimensions
I'm just trying to hold it down and maintain my existence
Lets put something down right here and we can do it with persistence
I'm knowing its real cause I can feel it in the distance (talk to me)
Man listen
Its like old folks that get settle in their ways
And it pays for one to be wise these days
Not afraid
Smoke one is my typical habitual ritual 
That let this music and these words give you a visual
Come Now!

Now I'm just tryin to gain green
(I'm doing the same thing)
Them hoes don't want to see me live
(They all wishing to change thing)
All doing some strange things
But leemee(?) Rico I know 
My baby mama keep them crooked police booking my dough
Looking for dough
(What you got?)
Nothing but beer, plus I got these fucking lyrics I wrote
You mean them niggaz fucking with you by flows
You make em count by zeros
(Aint they some hoes?)
Hell yeh!
I know, all up in a nigga shit
Fuckin with your women get, with it
Come on my nigga, ya'll stay committed
Spit it
If you ain't got a nigga get it
Flip it
Stay the same dog, never quit it
Dig it, Dig it

Devin the Dude,"(Devin) Walk up in da session wit my dick in my hand
Fat sweet in my mouth,a 24 ounce can
Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) I gotta visit from a old friend, fresh outta county
He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""c'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we cool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is
That nigga work for HBD been sellin' weed round here for years
So when you finish plottin and schemin' whatever you doin'
Wait fo' me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

Shit, a nipple or something, Just let me tickle it with my pinkie
And play with your, well you know, get my middle finger stankin'

(Girl: Hey don't touch that)
I was just kidding
but you was crunk at the club, now we're alone and you bullshittin
Kissin' all on my neck, squeezing all on my shit
You getting yourself all wet, simply for the funk of it
Why don't you get undressed, lay back, let me massage ya
I won't tell Timmy, if you won't tell Tosha
Everything should be Kosh-er, well you know kosher
Why let your lips hang, let 'em sing like they supposed to

Don't go to soon

Shoulda told you I couldn't make it

But I waited
I told myself that I would quit
Fuckin with ya, after I can tell all my friends that I hit
But now its Blue Ball Tuesday
I may be out but I'm not down
I hit the town, neighbors frown
Hearing my ultrasound
I couldn't hear my phone
But when I checked it, a message
Opened it up and read it
It was you, saying come get it
Hey, sure you ready?
I mean, you felt it before, you know its heavy
And hard; you have me 'bout to nut just thinking of you
Those titties, that ass, girl I think I love you

And then she saw him walk straight into the room
She was just on the phone luckily
Talking to a strong-boned nigga like me

Dick hard, hard times, I'm mad, gave the gas another smash
But fuck it, I'll get another chance
Cause tomorrow she's gonna borrow her mother's van
And that's a whole lot of room for the boom-shaka-laka
I've been spending time, thinking on how soon I can fuck her
But seems the bitch ain't gonna get no dick somewhat like Lassie
Cause her momma's takin the van to visit her Auntie in Tallahassee

Boog, weed, sess, skunk, pine, k, reefer, dank
Sell ya boy a plump dime
Killa, herb, grass, coffee, pot
We gotta get some mo' because this O is all we got
Smokin' everyday I can't let go
Rollin' perfect Sweets, I mean perfecto
Neighbors they say they smell this shit from next do'
And they keep me outa they house because they know I'ma fiend
Last month I pawned 17 sewing machines
Took the money to my Mexican patner his names Malito
...
We go way back, we'd lay back in his crib and get drunk
He always keeps some sess, but see sometimes he get's skunk
And he calls me when he get it, cause he know I'm wit it
And he tell me that's it's good but I'll believe it when I hit it
I'll show up with a cigar and then he bring out this bong
And before we get high we start singin' this song

Smokin' weed really ain't nothin' to brag about
Unless ya got friends like mine, look at this big bag I got
Straight from Jamaica from that nigga Naughty Dread
He got some shit with just one hit I bet yo' eyes get red
And he call his weed cali, smoke it in the chalis
""Take ya shoes off boy and try not to be careless""
We be jammin' to the reggae music feelin' every note
Both of our heads boppin' while we eatin' curried goat and he say
""Hey mon, pass that motherfucker this way mon""
I'm blowed, he blowed, we high
He got pounds of weed in the other room, knee high
And my nigga ain't greedy, he gives to the needy
He put me down with weed and I hook him up with beaties
We be trippin' off people who think weed makes you forget
But you was, uh, shit

[Chorus]

Niggas smokin' sweets, dimes, ounces to quarters
We pass the sess around in chronological order
But when ain't nobody got no weed shit seems to be hopeless
I know an old school weed smoker named Keofris
He always keep killer cause all he do is roll jokers
It's good for his cataracts and help him stay focused
He say him and a couple of his friends back in the game
They used to sing are and be the shoopdey doowop thing
They had bowl cuts they eyes tight lookin' like Chinamen
They had to switch up and change they name every now and then
Finally tried to be they self but people wouldn't accept it
Shit started gettin' strange so they say fuck it and left it
He said, ""Boy whatever ya do just keep goin'
If weed helps ya with the music keep the Sweets blowin'
One day you'll get some money, you can buy me some teeth
I want to see ya make it boy, ya kinda remind me of me
Cus I love the reefer"" Huh? What'd you say? ""Cheeba cheeba""

Out the little little seat freak trying to get the dude to curse
Wanted a nigga to rant and rave
Just because of my color, thinkin I can't behave

Attendants walked the asles as if we were in some type of camp
I seen all my belongings, big and small things
Disappearing underneath on ramp
Man, I started feeling kinda wicked
Should have never bought a ticket
Put on my seat belt in case
We land in shit creek
I had to grit me teeth
But then things kinda felt in place
I couldnt wait, broke out my big bag
Put it on the tray table
Wheels start rolling, table wouldn't stay stable
Waiter walked up and said do you want a beer?
I said yeah, he got happy start doing a cheer
He gave a bag of nuts to the nigga next in line
Put on a gas mask and pointed to the exit sign
I'm checkin it odd, I'm feeling the breeze
And everybody on the plane lookin at me, cause

Right now I feel so good that I
Won't let nothin or nobody bring me down

The weather started getting rough
And the big ass plane shook
I started trippin, cause everybody was flippin and dippin
And even hiding pocket books from crooks
I'm like look
I know its kinda scary, its a long way down
You should have had your shit together when you was on the ground
Ain't no time for whining and crying about dying
Cause when its your time, its your time, but right now I'm

Devin the Dude,"What's wrong man
Come on man hold it together man come on
I don't know why you crying over her anyway
Be strong!

She gave me everything I wanted from the start
Her mind, body and heart
And I just knew the two of us would never ever part
I used to fart under the covers and she'd just laugh
She even cleaned my balls when we would take a bath
She straightened up the bed when I was still in it
Get up and fix some breakfast
The kind of gal that makes you want to leave them other heffers alone
But my bone got a mind of its own
I continued to roam while she waited by the phone
Loneliness got the best of her
She wanted to explore
Her other options that she had, oh no my baby was no whore
Just a woman with needs, a desire to be apreciated
I tried to keep her in the nest, warm and incubated
But my heart was steady gettin colder
Coming home with not enough energy to even hold her
And then it happend
One bright early morn
I turned around to give my baby a hug and she was gone

She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone

Callin' house to house
Tryin' to figure out
Where could she be
She don't get up before me
And its damn near three
Its pouring down outside, raining cats and frogs
I know pretty soon, she's coming back to the house
Damn, 3:30, 4 o clock, five
Called her at 6, something must be wrong with the ride
Eyes wide, looking outside every ten minutes
Not realizing the relationship been finished
12 pack, 8 cups of coughee, 2 cups of tea
Hurry up and peepin out the curtain forgetting to pee
Telephone ring (brring) hurry up pick it up
I thought I heard some body say
""boy, I got ya bitch, what's up""
But it wasn't
But I still almost hit the star 69 button
Ready to cuss out whoever answered the phone
But I didn't call back, to face the fact that she was gone

She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone

Like a ticket through the comb
Can't imagine another motherfucker makin her moan
Got a call on my cell
It was her, what the hell
Wonderin what kind of story you got to tell
She said, she left a note under the bed
""had to get up early be back to get a loaf of bread""

Shit, loaf of bread, why you ain't been call me
""I had a flat""
You had a flat
""yes, I had a flat""
You didn't have enough minutes on ya phone to call me
""its locked in the car""
Oh...oh well shit, you left it in the car while you was on foot
""yes""
Alrite fuck it... just come on home, I'm here man
""I'm on my way""

Hello
Hey baby its me, I took care of everything
Oh yeh, he fell for that loaf of bread bullshit, didn't he?
As usual
Huha I knew it. Look, forget about that nigga
You need to come over here right now
Okay. I'm on my way

She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone",She's Gone
Devin the Dude,"Man I'm so high, I haven't landed yet
Don't know if I will, ever come down from this buzz that I feel
And I also got some kill yep, as if you didn't know
Nine times outa ten I'm ready, steady stayin' blowed
After unloadin' my shawties comin' back from QT
I fire up a doobie, you do you, I do me
There's people concerned about my health but they won't tell me
I don't even try to play it off, shit I know they smell me
(What is he on?) That's what they say when I leave
(What is he smokin' is you sho' it's just weed?)
I used to stay at the crib, seldom come out
'Cause they think my wealth and my health goes together somehow
I tried this, I tried that, I'm hooked on nuttin' but love
So it's hard to say ""fuck what people thinkin' of""
I dip in, I dip out, I go here, I go there
And I'm steady gettin' blowed yeah

[Chorus]
Smokin' weed, feelin' fine, steady gettin' blowed
Makin' niggaz understand and I'm lettin' these hoes know (Devin)
Don't keep steppin', steady stayin' on the scene
Doin' what I want to do
But some say that I'm takin' it to the X-treme

I'm higher, than a thumb tac on a flyer
Of Reeba Macintyre in the hood it's all good
It's understood by my niggaz and I figure they know
If they got a sweet and some heat
I got some weed and gon' blow
I toat across the nation, like a ten year vacation
My fuel tank is low but no I can't run outa patience
Gotta keep goin'
Let 'em know that I be steady gettin' blowed yeah

[Chorus]

Man I'm so high. Who am I? Oh yeah, Devin
Cloud-10 was aight but I'm damn near at eleven
Feelin' fine, killin' time well, not exactly
I try to stay uplifted so that bullshit can pass me
Some niggaz think I'm soft, so they try to harass me
Some think I'm smart, some think I'm dumb, some think I'm trashy
Ask me who got that good-good shit I probably know
'Cause I'm steady gettin' blowed yeah

[Chorus]

And I'm steady gettin' blowed... steady gettin' blowed

Gettin' high off whatever you get high off of
Get high off life
Matter fact, whatever your high may be
Get high to the extreme

And I'm steady gettin' blowed
You know why? ('Cause I'mon get high)

Devin the Dude,"Rollin' up another swisha, listenin' to the beat again
Drankin' but we concentratin', smoke another sweet again
Steadily rewindin', trying to make some hot shit
Oh, what a job this is

Another all-nighter, tryin' to get it done
Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

Drankin' yet I'm thinking of another rhyme
Smokin', hoping that some bad news will come some other time
'Cause I'm trying to do what I've loved, I love what I do
This music is something more different than the weed and the brew

That's why we mashin', we ain't asking for nothing, we working for it
Push it, peddled it to the people, they can't ignore it, this is for
All the independents, a few major labels
The big studios who still give niggas favors

On the mixin' and mastering, puzzlin' and
Plastering the tracks together on tapes, C-D's, wax or whatever
This is for all the engineers who smoke weed
Can't forget about the production cost and all the hidden fees

For another rhyme written, we spend time spittin' in the booth
Sometimes it's like a pigeon coop
But it's all for the cause, yeah, so I'm
Gonna continue to MC and smoke weed, you know I'm

Rollin' up another swisha, listenin' to the beat again
Drankin' but we concentratin', smoke another sweet again
Steadily rewindin', trying to make some hot shit
Oh, what a job this is

Another all-nighter, tryin' to get it done
Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

As easy as it looks to you, I make it look so easy
With the music I'd be making big impression I'd be leaving
And a lot of folks, they stop and stare thinking I'ma trickin' off
I roll another bleezy, puff it, pass it and shake it off

Move on to the next phase and it's amazing
The next generation of rappers, big Snoop Dogg raising
Hmm, that's 15 years in the game
Still got the fortune and fame, yeah, I'm doing my thang

Check this Devin, somebody said that real Gs to go heaven
So I'ma keep spittin' the truth on these fools like a reverend
Stay open like 7/11 that's 24/7, when you need some hot shit
Stop by and get you a beverage, I'm servin'

My rhymes like nickels and dimes
Plug it in, let it play and let me blow your mind
It's the dominant conglomerate, prominent and I'ma get
What I gotta get, twist another sweet and bob to the beat

Rollin' up another swisha, listenin' to the beat again
Drankin' but we concentratin', smoke another sweet again
Steadily rewindin', trying to make some hot shit
Oh, what a job this is

Another all-nighter, tryin' to get it done
Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

We work nights, we some vampires
Niggas gather 'round their beat like a campfire
Singin' folk songs but not no kumbaya, my Lord
You download it for free, we get charged back for it

I know you're saying, they won't know they won't miss it
Besides, I ain't a thief, they won't pay me a visit
So if I come to your job, take your corn on the cob
And take a couple kernels off it, that would be alright with you

Hell no, yeah, exactamundo
But we just keep recording and it ain't to get no condo
And candy, Bentley, Fanny with no panties in Miami
And that cute lil' chick named Tammy that you took to the Grammys

See we do it for that boy that graduated
That looked you in your eyes real tough and said 'preciate it
And that he wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for your CD number 9
And he's standing with his baby momma Kiki and she cryin'

Talkin' 'bout that they used to get high to me in high school
And they used to make love to me in college
Then they told me 'bout their first date listenin' to my tunes
And how he liked her finger nail polish

I say, hate to cut you off but I gotta go
I wish you could tell me mo' but I'm off to the studio, gotta write tonight
Hey, can you put us in your raps? I don't see why not
Devin is the dude you gon' probably hear him talkin' 'bout

Barely make it home with the morning sun
Baby mother thinking that you on some other shit
Oh, what a job this is

Yeah, this life we live, what a job this is, real spit man
A lot of folks want to walk in these shoes but
They just don't know man, it's a hell of a job, man
To be a rapper, MC, whatever you want to call it, man

We got a lot to deal with, family members
We gotta always look out for baby momma nagging
You know I'm saying kids need this and then again
The public need that, we gotta make hot music
'Cause if it ain't hot it don't mean shit
But you know, it's all in a day's work

What a job this is my nigga
What's crack-a-lackin' Devin, the Dizzude?
Snoop D-O dub, J Prince, Jazz Prince
Yeah, Rap-A-Lot still on top 2007",What a Job
Devin the Dude,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro

Some people spend dough just to see a brother flow
So blessings I gotta get 'em and grind all the time

Where are my bitches like I brought 'em all with me?

The heresy, the talking, the chatter
The gossip and the rumors
See to me, it don't matter
I barely go out
And if you ever see me
It's probably at a grocery sto', but not on TV
Cause when I get high - I get hungry, so I cook
Go get some weed and...open a book
Of papers, if I don't have a cigar
Hold up, wait - I got some blunts in the car
Mad dash, Brad back
With a fresh box of swishers
(I thought you said blunts?)
Cigarillos, what's the difference?
It's about what you put up in

Roll it - nigga, hit it!
2 minutes, you finished
I'm still gettin' throwed (hee-hee!)

But there is no way to stop it
And ain't no need in plotting
Cause that shit will leave you nothing
But alone and rotten
Friends gone and forgotten
But there's another option
You can just say fuck it!
Pull out your dick and tell all them hoes to suck it!
Been through it, influenced
Men do some crazy shit
Dabbled here on different drugs
That fucked me up and made me quit
My lady bitch, slut, ho, or whatever left me
(Which one?)
Shit! All of 'em, they never kept me!
Marriage swept me off my feet when I was younger
But yet, and still at big events
They wonder why I brung her
Yes, I hunger
For someone to understand the code
You can knock three times, you'll see
I'm just gettin' blowed

I be on that weed
In the afternoon
Yes, I zoom-zoom

I met a girl, she was fine and submissive
She was cool, she wasn't you
She only fuck, didn't cook, didn't do dishes
But that ain't what it's all about
Realized she was just like them other fake bitches
Slamming doors and throwing shit in my house
And now she's cutting up my shit, man what the fuck is this!!??
I sometimes think of you as I toss and turn at night
Now you're gone with someone else
And I lost the yearn to fight

Spending time worrying when you gon' put out
Thinking with my third leg with my foot out

You know, most of my time is pretty much thinking of you
I even look at the pictures we use to take
Realizing that I made a huge mistake
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
I'll do a lot of things differently
Respect your body and your mind
So I can have both at the same time

I didn't tell you how much I needed you in my life babe
I didn't tell you how much I care for you

That bump in your armpit is Cancer
That bump was turbulence
I guess it starts again

There is no reason for nostalgia,
Everything is still happening,
There is no reason for memory

The step, a choice.
I wish everything could have worked out the way you wanted it to
It's so tragic...so beautiful...
When everything is so hollow
Think of going home.

You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
So far, i've logged so many hours
With medications and the dog

And you keeps you where you wanted to be known
That's alright, you know that you've been framed

Devlin,"I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove.
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees.
My favorite emcee was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three, Temptation, Kiss 100, or Flava
Get off from school and take
Ninety two point three but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen.

Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'

Fifteen, bag of weed, bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark.
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm.
Sixteen, my bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast.
I guess I got around in the bits.
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt.
I met Ghetts when I was fourteen, lost touch.
By sixteen, I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them.
Mercston, Scorcher, Unique and Wretch and 'em.
Two thousand six, I was seventeen when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst.

Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'
Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'

By the time I hit seventeen, I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen.
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'.
Emcees being cocky and rude, then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes.
Monitor my brain waves, tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And emcees are opening doors in the same ways.
As I did when I was a kid, on Rinse radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
Seventeen with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face.

Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies

Nineteen, showing strength in the booth
Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do.
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved, the ascendance is due.
Original spitter, not remnants of you.
Swear I can see success in my view.
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
'Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through.
Kanye called me a gangster rapper; I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs, I just spit it real.
You're an emcee like C difficile.
I look skinny 'cause I keep on missing meals.
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels.
No children, sticking them rigid still
I guess my life's f***ed up but I'm only nineteen and I've got a lot of living still.

Devlin,"I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star
I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far.

If you long to be free, come for the ride you'll like what you see,
I reside in an infinite dream, and I fly in the sky like D double E
Exploring the depths of the sea, fish red yellow pink purple and green
Swim with sharks of the deadliest breed, mother nature is heaven indeed
Follow me on a marvelous trip, and insight into the bars that I script
Imagination is vital like timing, or the breaks in the car that you sit
I got a golden ticket like Charlie, to advance the position I'm in
And now I'm on the front line like an army, 
What the chances of trickle and thin.

I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star
I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far
I keep repeating in the dark, she said it didn't matter who you are
I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer 'Nothing but a dream'

I float on the breeze, like the pollen and the birds and the bee's
I'll always have roots in the ends, Like bushes and tree's upon metropolitan streets
But I'll smile when I'm dreaming, I'm somewhere far on the wings of a phoenix
Ow what a marvelous evening, I met Bob Marley and sparked up a 3 skin
And spoke about common affairs, and various ways to build and repair
Look deep in the depths of your mind, and you'll find that your imagination is there
I can't stop till my family crest is cemented in time, and I'm half way there
And then when I float on the breeze, I'll leave the throne to my heir.

I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star
I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far
I keep repeating in the dark, she said it didn't matter who you are
I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer 'nothing but a dream'

Through the stress and pain I've seen, is it wrong to dream a dream
Everyone holds the right, to have some hope in life
Through the stress and pain I've seen, is it wrong to dream a dream
When you find one hold it tight, it just might be your guiding light.

I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star

Devlin,"According to the Aztec calender 2012 is the end of the world
And time will unwind with a celestial cross in in the sky's in sync
And in line with itself so forget life as you know it
If you wanna view life in the eyes of a poet
Peer through mine in this fearful time
Where wages are cut but tax keeps growing
When the globe collapses on it's axis
Watch men, women and children with axes
Fighting for food cause?
And they haven't got jack shit
It looks like disasters back with a sting like elastic
But on a whole new scale now I'm talking inter galactic
Genocide in a moment of madness

As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days

As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day

Buildings burning
Pilgrims verming
Children are serving
Searching for earnings
Old bill are lurking
Circle the circuit
City cameras are perving
Don't park there if you ain't got a permit
Murders occurring but low level crime is the type their concerned with
Yeah with a microchip bill gates is a serpent in person
You relied on emergency service 999 says a lot when you turn it
The devil in disguise all loves been deserted
I'm watching animosity spread like herpes
I visualize alien crafts descending on earthlings
And all homosapiens left in the dirt like worms when there squirming
I smell petrol burning

As some set on the end of days
Capital city's burning in flames
Ocean swept your possessions away
Welcome to the end of days

As some set on end of days
There ain't no escaping natures rage
And I've never seen an atheist pray
Until the approaching of judgment day

Insight into a world of decline
Like Michelle Nostradammas mind
A moment of peace is harder to find
The thicker the skin the darker the mind
? accompany stars that are sent from the sky
A lot of men are repenting tonight
You wasted your life now wave it goodbye

I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

Hustling, money coming in, 
There ain't nothing worse than watching mummy struggling. 
Suffering, and I can't tell you how easy it is 
But I can tell you how tough it's been. 
I know you're wondering, well first off, 
I would need a warehouse to store my troubles in. 
Nobodies aware of what I'm covering up 
But one thing I'll erupt my bloods bubbling. 
I'm stressed out, frustrated and hungry 
That's enough to send a man over the edge humpty. 
And if it ain't me against the world 
Then I feel like I'm going against this whole country. 
Nobodies on my side they wanna take my soul, 
Body and my mind but I still got a problem with authority 
So what should I decide?

Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

First off, for too many years I've been worse off now 
Every single verse is bloody worth dosh, 
It's hard to always stay on track sometimes I swerve off, 
Life's a lesson, in one second you could learn a lot. 
Give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off. 
Because I've been left too long to rot in the eternal fog 
And I was always told to aim for the stars 
Now I'm cruising through space like Scotty and the captains log. 
Deep space mind, don't hate me just make yours how I make mine? 
Take time to stay tight, 
And when times get messy like a cage fight, 
We will soon see which individual suffers stage fright. 
I'll be ready on the double, 
My flows flexible and supple leave you buried like a dead man in the ruble. 
Fully proud how my teams emerging from the tunnel full of never ending trouble!

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

I was on the road all day or I was getting locked up. 
Had find some other way to change my life up, 
I was on the path but sometimes I fucked it right up. 
I was either thinking I should leave or I should quit, 
But something always telling me I don't know what it is, 
I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this, 
I know, I know, I know. 
I would always try my best but nothing ever worked, 
So someone please just tell me straight 
'cause now I'm feeling worse. 
Now my pockets on fire all my credits burnt. 
I always paid the price and I never learned. 
I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost, 
Cause anytime I would flip and they would call the dogs, 
Always scrapping, always fighting, 
Show my teeth music changed my life now I'm never lost.

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.

In hell with a dibs ain't walkin away
I can no longer stand with ya

You sold your soul with lies you told
And now it's time to ride alone

Forget the day you saw my face

Moving with me.
Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me

Bud, sweat and beers!

And tonight we're in London city.

I'm on the A13 on the way to the city, where the lights
Are bright with some boys that like to fight, I'm leaning. 
Out the window, smoking a spliffy.
Through the wind in my eyes, like tears that I cry,
Getting high on the essence of life.
'Cause tonight we're in London city. 
And I got 'bout four hundred with me
Fifteen minutes ago we left barking, now we're approaching
The city, I'm a laughing.
Wanna hit a restaurant first cause' I'm starving. 
Eat well for the start of emptying glasses. 
This is London city.
The best city in the world when everybody's not shanking
And blasting, young men moving to music and females
Shaking their a**es.

Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

Alright, I've finished my plate. 
Now I'm walking out the restaurant, 
lighting up the cigarette and then I pass half to my mate.
Many clubs and bars await. 
We're gonna drink and dance till it's late.
And my name is Bait, 
So a lotta young ladies wanna glance at my face. 
One a' got a glass in their hand and
A wiggling their ass and their waist.
It's the old t-show, sexy ladies who wind down low. 
And if ya get approached by a bloke, who smells of weed,
Smoke, don't act like you don't wanna know.
'Cause we got the city on smash. 
As the strobe lights flash, all I do is drink more champs
And spend more cash, London City no match.

Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

As the night comes to a closure I'm far from sober, 
But I carry on drinking like a soldier, 
Even when the night club's over.
Straight up in the morning and I still look smart but I'm far from a poser. 
I'm sporting, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Lyle and Scott
I'm nineteen with more grades than my Dad's got 
And your girl's still trying to watch. 
Well I guess my face just lights up the spots.
And now I'm pissed up running in the road, staggering,
Looking for a cab back to Bagenham to kick back and cotch,
With this sexy blue eyed brunette girl that I got.
With the light in the cab it was more than a lot.
London City just pop.

Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

Killer tsunamis caused by tectonic plates, changing shape, at the the oceans base, 
Releasing explosive rage. 
I'm just sat here in my burgundy robe observing the globe, 
Pondering if the life that I created will ever learn to evolve. 
I filled your oceans full of fish and I put birds in the sky, 
And everyday you sit and curse on your lives, you ain't worshiping I. 
How did you manage to ruin such a beautiful planet? 
The turn of the times left my continents and countries ridden with murder and crime, 
Earthly decline.

People look cold like the freezin' rain, 
All truth be told, we don't see the same. 
People look cold, like the freezin' rain, 
Like the freezin' rain, my son died in vain. 
I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you, 
I made this world for you. 
I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you, 
I made this world for you.

He made the world in seven days and six nights 
And then he rested on the seventh, now everybody's sinnin', 
It seems emptier in heaven 
Rest In Peace to everyone who lost their lives in Haiti and September the eleventh, 
As well as seven and seven. 
'Cause I was on the train an hour before, 
I guess I got a higher purpose in the eyes of the Lord, 
Who looks down from the sky into the fire and storm, 
And sees governments in unison like one big global Mafia, 
They're paying soldiers for a foe to blow a strap at ya'. 
From heaven's door watch him maintain the war, 
To continue selling metal to the masses like Metallica. 
I feel although a lot of love has been lost, 
If I was God I'd be cross that my son had to die on the cross, cross cross. 
If I was God I'd be cross that my son had to die on the cross

People look cold like the freezin' rain, 
All truth be told, we don't see the same. 
People look cold, like the freezin' rain, 
Like the freezin' rain, my son died in vain. 
I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you,

I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you,

Devlin,"Listen, yeah
A lifetime of dreaming, visualizing paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we're leaving
It's time to sacrifice a lot
'Cause you ain't happy with your job
And round here it's like nothin' seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I'm wondering if I runaway and came back another day,
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter's right for everybody's mumsy's sake.
And if I disappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

We share a last cigarette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we're breaking free
Like an escapist, 'cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up,
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can't remain in this domain of semi ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I disappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery.
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and
Then the I would reverse and I'd be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel 'til we see the English Channel

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

As the carriage pulls away,
I pull my lady closer and I tell her she's okay
'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I've come of age,
And as the train starts enterin' suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage,
That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day,
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day.
Kick back and just enjoy the raves,
With a lager and a spliff to blaze.
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I'd leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.",Runaway
Devlin,"Listen,
They wanna build me up,
Postpone my attempt to kill my bars,
Well you better have an army,
Cause' it's day one all of my boys show love,
Now I'm here where I should be,
When I'm high of a night I wonder where I would be,
On the streets where the thieves and the hoods be,

(The world still turns around)

As life continues
And with the lyrics and rhymes I bring you
I'm telling you strife you been through
Might make your heart feel colder than pingu,
I stand in a place,
Contemplating distant memories
You have never seen so many tear drops in a place
But a voice in my brain keeps telling me

(They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around
They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around)

Yeah, as the road spins on it's axis
I feel trapped in a box like matchsticks
But I've got the UK head over heels
Like gymnastics on a mad practice in back flips
But they wanna steel my career like silicon mastic
Some days when I wake I tell myself I'm feeling fantastic
Cause' whatever occurs
Time won't stop the earth still turns
Every lesson I've learnt
I reckon it's worth the pain and seconds of hurt
So as the world rotates
Isolate and float through space
A never ending cycles occurin'
A carousel that won't stop turning

They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around
They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around.

They wanna build me up to break me down
They show love when I was heard up
And now I'm coming up it seems they wanna break me down
They wanna build me up to break me down
They show love when I was heard up
But now I'm coming up it seems they wanna break me down.

They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around,
They build me up, to break me down,
But the world still turns around.",World Still Turns
Devlin,"I've been here for a period of time
So long that my brain has gone delirious inside
I think back on all the years that I've survived
Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes
But now I'm yesterday's news
And I'm tomorrow's promise but I've got my mince pies

Open wide trying to visualize devils in disguise
Devz I'm like Picasso cause I've been through every shade of blue
I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died
It stayed alive cause I was made to ignite
Like dynamite I'm from the cold with heavy night
I'm riding tight notice flows slip and slide
Like a tire in the snow cause there ain't no grip on ice

I'm cold in the Moscow and it's minus 29
So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds
Lost souls just trying to live the higher life

I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here, 
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here, 
With the government and yesterday's news

Devlin, I'm dangerous I'm dead guys
And every week forgotten like yesterday's headlines
I've been through the blues just like Elvis' best time
But I ain't wearing suede shoes, I've just got the best rhymes
I refuse to die, you could attempt to kill me twenty times
But I'll still rise like I'm the day walker Wesley Snipes
So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry

When I witness blood seeking through his veins
This has become apparent I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't
So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains
About my rhymes but when I'm talking about?
So cut the conversation cause I've been lower rating
Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation
To a better place in time better for leaving this place behind

I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues
But it's funny how I'm still here, 
With the government and yesterday's news
I've been here so long, through the sadness and the blues

Devlin,"There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief, yeah
There’s too much confusion
Mmm I can’t get no relief

Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
No one up at his word

Yeah, I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house see my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When I’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (like a failed man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl ('cause your world is the same as mine)

Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savoir the buzz
The flavor of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though that’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win all of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious I’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

Well all along the watchtower

But I don't have the words in my head
Days are passing by and all the leaves are changing too
But time won't change the things unsaid

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how

How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like a laugh but I cried
Oh, I wish I could push rewind

Oh, stupid pride it just can't hide the holes inside my heart
'Cause I need you here with me
Oh, I wish that I could take it back, I'd go back to the start

Devlin,"Devlin, yeah
Wretch 32 in the building
Let's take it back there, time to go in
Tell 'em Wretch, tell 'em Wretch

I'm on some off with your head shit
I keep firing, I'm not The Apprentice
Devs told me to go in, ah yeah
So I wrap blocked all the exits
Yes I'll be here forever
The chair's so far I'll leave here in leather
So dark, so cold
With a couple girls sitting on my lap
I'm never gonna say I'm back
I'm a little too in love with plaques
I moved in to the hall of fame
So I wipe my feet on tracks

I'ma kill it, I'm a killer
See me with one glove, it's a Thriller
I already had a number one for my dinner
Me and Devs go in there, inner

And we're out of here, I doubt you're near
I've already been a thousand 'ere
But if you live for the money, then you die for the money
So I ain't even trying to count it, I swear

And if you don't think I'm fucked
Middle finger up
Fuck me, fuck you
I'll make you feel small when I big you up

Up, up and away, I can't see ya
On my own scale, I'm a Libra
Told 'em leave me alone, I wanna leave, uh
Had to give 'em so dough to get a pizza

Every day I have to take away
Tomorrow won't be the same today
I don't score when I'm at home
I strike more when I play away

Shut down the asylum
Before I creep through the exit, find it
Jump any fence inside then drag a man
Out of a car that he just was driving

And then put the pedal to the floor
I'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking
I ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch
Already killed this UK Grime thing

And there's not a lot left that could swing with shit
And the doctor of death flying
Wretch 32 said it's off with his head
Got cold feet then it's frost on your creps

Never mind where you're walking, watch where you step
Mind what you're talking, I might dissect
Any guy trying a bullshit vibe on a sec
Can't fuck with me like my wife on the reds

Too unorthodox to let it go
So I let 'em know that I'm pro, but my name ain't Stephen
Soul seems to be involved
I'm burying men six deep in a hole, no reason

You're getting buried alive, I'm tryina better my life
While some men are cutting up suits
With scissors and severing ties
I let 'em know that it's Devlin's time

No disputing I shift to the move
This game from the days of The Movement
Using the only utensil I knew to
Now I need loot, this a like to my figures on YouTube

Retreat or advance then, you choose
At the present I'm king like Presley
Test me, then I'm running out full of anger
And envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes

Ride a beat like a Traktor, ey
But I ain't getting on a train, 'ey
Everybody wants to act up, yeah
'Til you put 'em in the frame

And I ain't got time for shit, patience's thinner than my toilet roll
I'm a fixed up brother from a broken home
I remember I used to watch Home Alone
Now I'm home alone in my owner home

This millennium, got a loada dome
Rome then roam
Came home smelling like hot Cologne
Had a success overdose, woah

You see my roll-on flow
And I'm so sure that I can't be old
Yet all my heels I carry on toe to toe
When we take this game now, so cologne

You couldn't play my post
I'm an old soul like an ancient ghost
That created his name in the game and he
Took shit to another level on the whole

I can't really explain my brain
But if you peeked inside of my skull
You'd see shit so deep in my rear
Eye low deep, know why I feel this cold

And I feel like the caped crusader
Here on the brink of a dangerous caper
I'm always collected and calm in battle
Can't be rattled, go sample a shaker

OT, I'm an out taker
I'm taking out any men that are minor
And think that they're major, there's a devil and a
Wretch that just broke out of the chamber

Yes, now I'm going for the hat-trick
One singer, one model, one actress
But I might disappear if you're acting
Or singing me a new tune on a mad pitch

Back to my rap shit
I'ma go hard this year
Can't be looking at the past this year
That won't help me get past this year

In an extra zone next to tracks
Multiple hits but with extra swag
I've divided my time
Royalties won't forget to add

And I ain't adding nobody on my BB
iPhone when I want you to see me
I plane, You tube
See me on Wretch32 TV

I'm getting flashbacks from the past
Head full of hate and a mouth full of bars
Me and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span
Taking the extra yard

We're going extra hard, no I can not be barred
Say what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out
Anyways, I've already broke through the fence now
And I'm quite relentless when I vex out

Everybody wants to the the best out
But he gets stripped like a bitch when I dress down
Think you're a face round 'ere?
Get left lying face down in a next town

Pull strings like Robbie Lamont
On the beat and I'm dropping the bomb
I'll make you all feel sick like Sue Bo dropping her thong

Devlin,"When the sky breaks it rains
So just let the H2O splash upon the graves
Of all the souls I used to know but now have passed away
Men say that time can heal a situation
But this pain is not a passing phase
Now I'm curious how many years a heart can ache
Feel like a Minotaur meandering this darkened place
Trying to find a way to maybe find the light of day
If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again
And sit and hold my nan's hands while she felt the pain
And say hello to old mates behind the pearly gates
Given the chance to glance back at my childish face
I'd try and smile the way I smiled just like a child again
Before I had to say goodbye to anybody
And the loved ones I've lost all had life within their bodies
My side was less lonely then
You wanna cry well come and hold me then
I think I need the blessing of some holy men

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I had minutes on my hand just like a time piece
I'd turn the clocks back and maybe try to find peace
As well as my ID, so rewind me
Just like a video cassette cause I'm upset that I ain't seen
Some faces in a while just apparitions in my dream
That ends abruptly when they try to hug me through the screen
Of smoke that's engulfing me
Like the coastline with its high tide
And you can see the sands and the oceans meet
No one told me when this ride began to hold my seat
Time flies like Emmet Brown was in the driver's seat
You talk of irony
Well now I'm lonely
But I'm searching for my privacy
This life won't comply with me
I think I need some dead relatives either side of me
To keep me company and guide me through the library
Of neverending stories full of lies and deceit
Hi Ho Silver, Lone Ranger riding to the beat

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I could rewind time to its slowest
I'd look at life at its heights and its lowest
So I could maybe try to recollect
What made me who I am besides a poet
Besides a poet

How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried

And I'm here to show you I ain't never left
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend
Loaded on that green floating on your genes
I'll be that lion to your queen

To everyone that's high and everyone's that drunk
To everyone that finds that life is kinda fucked
To everyone that died before their time was up
Live your lives through me, it's time we live it up

Don't you know where I've, I've been coming from
Know I, see I, I'll blow your mind away",Blow Your Mind
Devlin,"Oh shit, is it my go?
I'll just let everyone spit when I lie low
Then strike when the time feels right
Self instructed, fuck your advice
I don't want much but a slut for a wife
Money in the bank piled up would be nice
We're all after a luxury life but the ugliest sights are corrupting our minds
Until your brain can't think for itself, it's just driven by the rage inside
Best not slip like a baby on ice
Some man are sharp to react like Arabian knights
I'm at a stage in my life
Where I don't care for the hype
I just wanna better my career
If you've got a vendetta though, I'm here
We can make arrangements right
No snake, I'm a crane in flight
The dangerous heights
Painting a page like Damien Rice
When it's late and I'm high
Tryna bring the painting to life
Like my boy Rawz Artilla, I can do what I want, I can say what I like
I can make dead ravens fly
In the jaded sky when I spray these rhymes
I got pointed a gun at my lyrics
Clicked on the trigger then I waved goodbye
I'll put the bar in the sky
I ain't alive, and dead men don't die
Tell them all that it's Devlinstein
Infecting minds 'til they're F'd like mine
When I'm in effect I'm electric
I'm like Jay Fox, I'm electrolive
But there ain't no Spiderman
They try to defy the plan, I'm insighting this fiery land there's no hiding here
Come and find me right where I stand
No budging, faking, bluffing, all I can do is play with a hand
I was given in a place called Britain, where the sun don't shine when the rain comes down
I ain't no liar
Doggzy and Siah
All the first man in grime are the fire
That make me feel like taking a wire
I'm wrapping it around your neck when I step
Dev's the messiah
Hybrid fire
Cloning my genes with the genie of hire
Understand I'm gonna wreck this set
I bite, I don't bark, get a tetanus check
Whoever you select or dissect in so many sets when I send these threats
I'll treble any bet that you've set
Wait until my lyrics start taking effect
Breaking the spirit of the jaded
Backslash faded, and new-comers with the rep
'Cause I'm watching, so watch it
I'm clocking every goddamn step
Mic check, if you wanna be in set well stiffen up your Exoskeletons
Insects wanna creep and crawl around me 'cause they heard that I'm Devlin
In jest I should slaughter you all and then bury 'em for acting feminine
Contest, and I'm making you subject one in my strange experiment
Malevolent, pain indefinite
Dark development, Drugnam resident
Periodic when I store every element
You'll never know what's in store for your regiment
J don't give an F to the K
I know you see the inside of the presidents
Brains sprayed by the great
Country that we gave birth to that buried them
I've never been credited fully, I know
That's why I've gotta play this bully-ish role
You don't wanna fuck with me, I look nice, but I'm not like the Annabelle doll, you know
Devlin is going on cold, you know
This is the OT show, you know
I ain't never sold my soul, you know
Devlin's ruthless, like a house in a hurricane, quick here I come again
Well equipped for this shit when I run away
When my tongue get burnt like a ginger on a sunny day
Don't care what he'd fucking say
Telling me I'm nothing great, you muppet wait, I'm big like Puffy's mate
I'll put your name in a letter and I'll seal your fate
I maintain no pain, no gain
Youngest veteran inside this game
I've earned my stripes, burnt these mics
I inspired these kids when I came

Devlin,"When I'm spittin' on grime, I bring it to life
I roll like a menace at night, the venomous type

And went in, step back from the mic
You don't wanna scrap nor fight
Corned Beef City is haunted and gritty
Run for the hills, be scared for your life
Or else be down to ride just like Phillies
Silly isn't it they listenin' but don't hear me
Man this shit can't stand
So that's why I'm cuttin' their achilles

Mass murder your squad, get burnt and I'm gone
Might be strong and the time ain't long
You be back home right where you belong

The mack might clap when the drama is on
Animal acts, you'll get stalked by the pap
Dead men's shoes, you don't really wanna be inside them clogs
We're alive but we're lost
Tell me what does irony cost?
Well my name's Devlin
But they wanna look at me like God
You know what? I ain't nobody's savior
When I'm chained to this glacier I'm a slave to the frost
Like I made it with Sadie, and got knee deep in her slot, oh gosh

Find an exit and use one
Under credited for anythin' the crew done
Still relative, a relative to you son
We're all brothers in this settlement, it's too glum
Soon come, rise of a true sun
Too blunt, I can be a true cunt
Too drunk, chattin' to a new slut
Too fucked, to ever give two fucks
Unless I had sisters lubed up, who's up?
You wanna make a move huh?
I'm killin' fish with this big harpoon gun
Move up or get moved up by Devs

Devlin,"When I was young, I knew this kid
And his life was always madness
His mum was on them crack rocks
When he was young, his Dad left
Kids would call him 'have-not'
And worse, I bet you can guess
Scummy, tramp, jack-pot
His mum's still at the crack spot
He's hungry and he's hacked off
There's blood all down his tracktop
Them bullies caught him slipping
He curls up when they're kicking
Punching, biting, spitting
Now there's phones out with the cams on
He dies some more inside
Then he cries when he gets stamped on
It's damn wrong
Any part of him that was man's gone
They finally knocked him out, he saw a light and thought he'd found God
Only then to wake, right back inside this town, lost
Cold but he don't care much, his only friend was Jack Frost
His skinny little frame aches
There's cuts upon his grazed face
Trying to find a safe way home, that may be long
He looks above and screams ""Why'd you bring this hell on me?""
At night I try and sleep but can't, I hear this song

I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

Years pass and he was chilling
On this park bench spitting
Freestyling to himself
About his life, that it was hell
When this crazy local villain
Sat down and told him ""Listen
I've seen how hard your life has been, I think it's time I helped""
If you like, you'll work for me, the boys will welcome you as well
If you've got beef then we've got beef, we'll ride on them with shells
You never deserved the cards you got
Here's your chance to passed them off
Take a gamble, cast the rod
It's time you showed this world
Says ""Yeah man, fuck it
I might as well be thugging
This life has gave me nothing""
Can feel inside himself, the accumulated hatred
Was soon replacing basic
Human moods a face with
A past and you can tell
But it's all about his future now
Olders got him moving round
Running guns, moving grams
Flick-knife on his belt
He's dying to use his blade though
For years you made him scapegoat
Now take note, you try him now, you're getting straight poked (Oh well)

I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

He's the man now, stand down
He's shotting up this mad town
Taxing other shotters with yoggers and his mad pals
I called him Sonic, wherever he went there was always tales
Of clarat and vomit, I think he's trying to even the scale
He feels euphoric, a hoodrat that was beaten down ironically giving the beatings now
It's all evened out, a child that was screaming out
Is a man with an evil scowl
Oh shit! What's this?
Someone that he's seen in town
Used to punch him around (ho)
Now he's reaching around (yo)
And his heater is out so
Now he's blasting rounds
And his target's down
Like Warren in Barking town
And he's laughing proud
His heart is drowned
Nobody can save him now
He's a monster made by man, Mary Shelly ain't around
So this ain't no act of fiction
When I find these words and fix 'em
To the page to make you see where this child went off the rails (I'm done now)

I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop

Devlin,"I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
'Til the day that I'm free
You do you, I'll do me

I look back now and I can't explain it
Always knew that I was waiting for greatness
Mum wanted me to work in the slave shift
But I was writing my lyrics in the grave shift
Perfecting the style so amazing I rose through the ranks so quick I was blazing
Sorry to upset you mother but right now I've gotta do me, time's wasting
I had a scheme and a dream. Time that I prove I could stand on my feet
Jab or weave here in the city full of feats and fiends
Life don't stop, time don't sleep
I feel like I'm lost
My ears are on fire, they speak
And they all think they know what's best but

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
'Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me

They laugh at your vision, make a lasting decision
To let your heart be driven
Like the Batmobile with the Stig in
Keep shit real in the field no fibbin'
Real we can feel 'cause that's how we're living
We're all different here in Great Britain
So embrace yourself and envision that your skin never left you imprisoned
Be whatever you wanna be man, kill 'em
You're unlike any other, aim for the sky my brother
Do it your way, this life is a bitch but love her
In the doorway I see the ghost of a soul that I knew last summer
Love to your girl and your kids and your mother
We can't hold joy without stifer

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
'Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me

They're like Devs do a grime track, I'm like why, would you like that?
Would you lend me your score if things got raw like before on the floor no money up in my bank
I didn't think so mate so let me do me in this life while I wait to right my mistakes
Wipe these slates, everyday is a new blind date
I'm unsure of what I just might face
But as long as I'm true to myself, what this path might lead to is fate
I'll follow this road like that Dorothy girl
Even if the bricks ain't golden and I bet I do it historically well
I ain't no big shot in your focus just me in this illogical world

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me

She told me think before you speak
You better run for cover
When you hear the sound of the police
Now look at what I started
Lord I beg your pardon
I need to leave this secret garden
They say home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is

Life's crazy now! I'm asking how many of my friends got babies now
Life ain't waiting around for no man it won't slow down it just speeds up that's when I freeze up
And I think of the future do I want daughters do I need sons
In this messed up world do I need love
Need drink, do I need skunk
To elevate me like fiends, fuck!
Jim you think too deep cuz
Yeah I know it and I hate my brain 'cause it never can go with the grain
This life's an enigma straight
No peace 'til I rest in peace

I've seen a lot of lights flash
Done well for a white trash kid that dwelled in the timelapse
Vibing to 90s rap in my night cap tryna bring time back
Whys that? I don't really know but I worked on impulse
Writing tracks all about where my life's at
I never knew I'd be a live act many years later
When you're breaking through they all rate you
But when you make the cut they all hate you
Now I'm isolated I'm a stranger
Anywhere I go I'm in danger 'cause there's always gonna be a hater
What's life about? Will I find out later

They say home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is

When the music dies and I'm obsolete I'll spit my rhymes on a somber beat
Wave bye-bye like Dom McClean fly through time in a quantum leap
Witness life from a godly seat observing those that were lost like me
Explorers lost at sea when the siren seems so sweet
It's enchanting 'til you don't know who you are and your fate's advancing
Look around you're getting older now and still wasting chances
Raised in carnage now I feel like Bane in darkness
But I'm still dancing to an unknown beat with the speakers blasting

I should have listened to my mother
She told me think before you speak

Devlin,"I was sat at the bar deep in a trance I just arrived from 'Nam
But I'll play this show and I feel like shit and I'll make these people dance
Until I'm parched, tryna get a drink, barmaid walked past

When I've played this show and it's live
I'mma find that girl that I liked and see if I can catch her vibes
But it's now getting packed inside so I grab this mic and I'm not even a fraction shy

I swear that I've got broken lungs
I'm lying down backstage on a sofa
Tryna catch my breath and I'm slumped
But don't think for a sec that I've died my death
Get back on the 'Yac and the rum
And it's done, now I'm flying again
I got a snout in my hand again and I'm drunk
And I found that pretty little thing I was eyeing up right behind of the junk
As it all transpires she don't live far from the place that I call my slum

So I might you only live once

When I should have gone back to the manor
But I got on so well with you all that I stayed for a week with Term
And I had a, extraordinary time in the morning light somewhere in the sky with Gazza
Susan, Dan, Jordy and man like Bill anything don't matter
Why the hell would I wanna go home
I'm right here in this Spaniard city
Sitting next to an English rose

In London it's freezing cold
More grief, more beef on the roads
A reality check so I know if I left him out it'd be silly

Checking in with the many factions

Of devolutionary humans
Who have waited so faithfully this past year
While Devo gathered its strength
For the next offensive

As many of you can see
The road ahead is filled with danger
It's not nuclear bombs we must fear

Or lack of it on this planet
It's time to go beyond the normal thing
It's time to do the super thing

New songs, new films and new approaches
To survival, in a world filled with subhumans

That's all we get
From those who pretend to know but don't
But once again Devo attempts

To cut through the mental grease and grime
With techniques of positive mutation
Designed to protect you
From the ninnies and the twits

Remember, no one knows
So let's find out, Devo asks the questions
That help point us all in the right direction
To go forward, move ahead

And give the past the slip
It's time to seek out new traditions
We know where the old one's took us
And now we are all here together

Of Devo's new traditionalist spirit

Of Devo's latest musical outpourings

But rather, it is an investment in the future
In a blow against the empire

Devo,"I've been walking in a deep sleep;
Sleepwalking, but I just woke up
From a deep sleep.
A very deep sleep.
I've been running on remote control,
In a deep sleep.
I awoke the moment I was told
That a smile is just a frown turned around,
On the face of a clown with a mean streak.

It was a deep sleep,
A very deep sleep.
I can't remember what I used to know.
Somebody help me now and let me go.
Into a deep sleep.

Push me back, now let me go
Into a dream again.
To a sleep unlike before,
So deep it never ends.

Sinking deeper after I forgot.

And its full of life 
But it stops somewhere 
'Cause time keeps ticking away
Let me tell you about a boy 
An average spud 
He was twice in love 
With two very different girls 
Knowing life was short 
He told them both the truth 
But they already knew
Now he's a happy guy
Well its a random turn 
On a game show wheel 
And it stops somewhere 
'Cause time keeps ticking away
Let me tell you about a man 
A tragic case

He shriveled up and died 
From a broken heard 
Reincarnated as a work of art 
He's got a brand new start 
Hey! 
Now he's a happy guy",Happy Guy
Devo,"Hell is where you put me 
And hell is where you're going to 
Until the next life 
I say this twisted prayer for you 
May the torment you put out 
Come back around twice multiplied.
Even though you let me go 
I've got to let you know 
I'd cry if you died.

The past is where you see me 
The past is what will bring you down 
Destiny a moon eclipsed 
In the shadows all is darkness now 
May the evil in your heart 
Be your one and only friend for life
You pretend I don't exist 
I have to let you know 
I'd cry if you died
Somewhere special 
Voices form words 

And the words have meaning 
So I reach out for someone new 
And I wonder 

Will it ever be alright 
(then I hear you secret radio 
Signaling that its time to go)
Hell is where you put me 
And hell is where well meet again 
I will be waiting

Molten pools of mockery 
Reflect a million sleepless nights 
Even though you acted low 
I've got to let you know 
I'd cry if you died",I'd Cry If You Died
Devo,"If you ever had a clue
You never acted like you knew
When you took away the reasons
And you chopped my heart in two
Once you start to doubt

When you don't know what it's about
It's time to read the warning signs
Of a man turned inside out
For a guy needs a good reason
Something to prod him on
When you chopped me up like liver
It all started going wrong
So I bought a fiberglass helmet
Some goggles to match

I'm a human bullet baby
And you haven't seen the last
Of a man turned inside out

So I got myself a position
And I'm working my way up
Took a three way lucky number
Now I'm heading for the top",Man Turned Inside Out

Except a couple of people 
Wasting lots of time 
Worrying about the future 
Forever asking why 
Some people go on living 
While others die before their time 
Yet there's never been a reason 
Whatever is is right 
If only just because 
Its much too big a fight 
Like the painter who is way ahead 
Or worse still far behind 
You only punch yourself out 
When you start swinging blind
These are the things too often gone unsaid 
These are the things that keep 
You better off than dead 
These are the things that keep running through your head 

These are the things too often gone unsaid
Who are you and who am I 
Except a couple of people 
With nothing else to do 
But follow vain obsessions 
Making gestures towards the truth 
While trying to ignore it 
When its convenient to 
The symbols we believe in 
Sometimes turn inside out 
Reshaping each dimension 
Were so sure about 
Dreams get so frustrated 
Fantasies turn pranks 
A simple ounce of common sense 
Is money in the bank.",Plain Truth

Burning bright as the lights on a highway

With my camera in hand

Watch it count down to the end of the day

What it meant to me

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Until his son would cry

Then he'd run him down

Just like old faithful
The eternal fountain of filthi
I took a walk straight out of town
But then I stopped and took my time for pleasure

I was alone, I looked around
I heard a voice 50 I buckled for safety
And there it was down on the ground
A pool of sound that showed my own reflection
In a fountain of filth
Eternal fountain of filth

I tried to run I couldn't move
Frozen solid while the thoughts of men
Attacked me
Out of my head the fountain shot
And drowned me in a serum that I couldn't
Put a stop to

It was me myself and I locked in a struggle
With the talking head below me
In a fountain of filth
Eternal fountain of filth

I got a hunger that makes me say things
I got a hunger that makes me do things
I got a hunger that makes me want things

I'm just a victim of filth

From the reach of
From the appeal of

When I was in goosesteps. 
She said I would gas them 
And now I'm a big man
Filling up autos 
That beep at me often 
I drop what I'm doing 
And wait on them cheerfullv 
Some choose the big pump 
And other's the small
It's a small small world 
And I hear 'dem autos call 
Well I'm a big time pumper 
And I pump'em full of my gas 
And if you give me static 
I'll tell ya blow it up your ass 
My station is pretty 
I keep it in top shape

'cause I got the answers 
To all of their auto needs 
I fix 'em up often 
And relieve their tension 
'cause no one wants an auto 
That threatens to lose it 
The auto's come crawlin' 
Into my station 
They beep at me always 
I stop what I'm doing 
And greet them with smiles 
I call ""fill 'er up?"" 
They yell back ""one dollar"" 
I wipe all the dead bugs 
And dirt off their windshield 
And connect my big hose 
Up to their gas tank 
The gas hums as it enters 
And fulls up their empty tank 
I do two at a time now 
I've developed a technique 
My timing is very good 
If not always precise 
I give them a fair deal 
They drive off satisfied 
We need each other's business 
Without which we could not survive 
We like to trade money- 
Because it means honor, 
Not like those people 
Who are sick and can't touch it 
Because they're unhealthy, 
They leave me cold. 
I help who I can help 
And feel nothing for those who 
Don't come to my station 
For I'll only tow those who 
Show me their honor 
I can't help evervbody 
And I'm not my brother's keeper 
We huddle together 
And those who come to me 
We huddle together 
And despite the weather 
We find strength in our circle 
I'm very important 
To the big and the little guy 
We all need each other 
To keep ourselves going 
Their auto's all need me 
My pump's need their empty tanks and 
If the good lord is willing 
We shall be here to the end

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?

A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Devo,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA

You want soft things
You need soft things

Is that you're off to a bangin' start!

Devo,"A song of truth and beauty for you.

In the bigger scheme of things
We haven't been around here more than a moment.

And yet too many, it seems,
Believe we are creating a brand new world around us.
We are creating a brand new world without us.

Maybe it really is okay.
Although we're digging our own graves at this moment.

If we should all just disappear
The skies and waters will clear in a world without us

And there's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home
To return to.

We push against the rest of life
As if we can survive without the world around us.

Can't have a rainbow without the rain.
Can't have a painting without the pain.
Can't have a lover walk out
Without the love leaving with them.

There's no place like home.
No place like home
To return to.

And there's no place like home.

As graceful as can be
Then you stuck in the needle
And sucked my blood

Helpless like a worm watch me twist and squirm

How can you see all these things in me?
I can't believe you

I'm looking in my funhouse mirror
I'm disgusted by what I see
I strain to catch a glimpse of the light
You claim to see around me

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me
The more that I attack
I just can't see what you see in me


You want to destroy self-portraits that I paint
Through picasso's eyes
But it's hard to discard
Weapons that I use
In my daily self-destruction

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me
The more that I attack
I just can't see what you see in me


I'm sitting on the corner of paranoid and hopelessness
Waiting, waiting
For you to take me away
I'm always trying to get rid of you
When what I really want
Is for you to stay

And the more I try to run away
The more you pull me back
And the more you try to love me

Hearts gift-wrapped barbed wire as the move from place to place
And he can nail them on the wind
The demons chasing after him

White line after white line he inhales
White line after white line he inhales

He’s a drifter and a gambler
He’s a lonely rolling stone
He’s a dreamer and a rambler
And the highway is his home
All the pain that he’s collected
On a long and wicked road is in his eyes
But the dream in inside the drifter never dies

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

One long drift across the lake of Avalon

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Pulling at its bow

Help you grow

Panthers build their blood to bury
Daughters leave their dads to marry

Speed of red flashes
And all the bells ringing

In the weeds

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Dexter Gordon,"Love locked out in all the cold and rain,
Love locked out may never come again.
Love locked out and weeping bitter tears,
No-one ever hears him calling.

No-one needs the precious gift he brings,
No-one heeds the song of love he sings,
On the door he beats his tiny wings,
Just love locked out.

A world without love is a world without life,
A sad world full of gloom,
So see there's a place for love in your heart,
Why, he doesn't need much room.

Love is well worth the waiting for,
When he comes knocking at your door,
Fling it wide open, for love locked out
Will come no more, no more.

things is to shoot men who arrange things, Dear Robin

Dexys Midnight Runners,"Old have memories to keep all cold away.
What is that you say?
No sense to dwell.
Old, are you ridiculed and fumed away,
No attention paid?
I thought as much. Yes and the dumb patriots have their say,
Only see their way.
Nothing to sell.
And worse from us, so obvious,
Preposterous, when you think of the time that each has spent.

I was lonely 
I guess I'm always on my own

I was living, living with her beside me 
Not knowing where she was 
She was living in a world of silence (I won't lead you down) 
Just to bring about a course of violence (I won't lead you down) 
And she was moving towards moving on (I won't lead you down) 
It took the longest time to say 
You took everything from me 

There was a thought a might be praying

I know I won't be praying anymore

I'll tell ya a story
About a country girl
Oh yea

She was a country girl from Cleveland, Texas
In a big city and she liked my necklace (Bling Bling)
So we started talking, while we took a ride
In thee big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side (Oh yea)
She was a country girl, from the class of '96 ('96)
A big booty with some big ole country (damn)
A country name with some country attitude
Say yes Mam, but at times she's kinda rude
A daddy's girl, so I had to watch my ass
Sixteen, Mr. Hill would whoop my ass
He can't kick it, I'm a city kid
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did (we did)
Oh yea

I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

She liked country living and acoustic guitars
And Kenny Chesney in country bars
And Cadillacs and I couldn't relate
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date
And her dad hated me, I knew it
Didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears and black music
We still chill cow tipping and tripping
With that brushed papa shirt lift back 'cause she was tipping (Oh yea)
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin' (Hmm)
Ain't used to my style big limos and clubbin' (We be clubbin')
A city kid and I'm doing my thang
I like an ole country girl and this is how I sang
Yee-hoo, What, What

I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world

Oh yea

A country girl cut off jeans and lollipops
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops
A country girl with them country ways
Livin' big city nights but them country days (Ugh)
A country girl don't understand thuggin' (What)
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin'
A country girl pigtails and care free
No direct dish, just Channel 3 (Oh, wait a minute)

This the only channel you have?
What?
Oh yea!

A city kid in a different world

Forget about love I like thongs and tattoos
Peggy Sues and boots, high heel stiletto shoes
I don't miss my ex, I like JB & Crown
I hit my boy scotch when that Jack ain't down
And no late night drama, no time to think
It's last call, 10 minutes, it's time to drink
I'm all smiles and hugs, Strip clubs I'm kinda twisted
It's 2 am and I'm still double fistin (you know)
You can have your man I got Britney and Hannah
A New York girl and one from Alabama
And you miss me now, but Kelly's on my mind
Oh I might call Heather just to pass the time
You didn't like my ways so now I'm livin it up
Totin up and showin up keep filling my cup
I may, I may not, say whatever you say

There's no worries tonight and no cares, so let's go
'cause I met a nice girl, I think her name was Tammy
I tipped her 20 bux, got to feel her fanny
For a good five minutes, thought it was true love
Til I realized I was in the elks club (what)
I'm single now so come sit on my lap
I got 5 more dollars in my baseball cap
I don't miss my girl now, hey baby where you goin?
She had thick thighs, half her ass was showin
It's just me and my bros in limos and live shows
Throwin them bows love comes and then it goes
And I told you, no bluffs, it's all true
Now it's Babydolls, Cheatas and Déjà vu
And my mind's over you more and more everyday
But in the meantime I'ma drink you away

Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle 'cause I'm too messed up

A city kid in a different world
But I fell outta love with that country girl
No headaches, heartbreaks, it's just drinks and bottles
I went from country girls to dating plus size models
(?????) cold brews, booty calls and malls
And big balls and big drawers in the bathroom stalls
And now I'm clubbin, lovin them girls with ass cracks
Lips waxed and girls with the damn the big racks
I'm done with you and it's back to straight gin
And I'm cussin you out with a half drunk grin
And I'm lovely 'cause it gets no better
I'm fully fueled up when I wrote this letter
I'm writing goodbyes, it's no ties and no lies
Blond hair and blue eyes, kiss my ass goodbye
I'm back to the bar 'cause my therapy's there
6 drinks later like I don't even care

Dharmata 101,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

Heard all your dead end words (the rancid air). 
In a dream laced with ice, and tragedy. 

In a rage, how will it end? Burn on, away. 
Thrown back again. In a rage. 
Ran out, pushed against the ground.

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Di Lacuna,"I read a note my Grandma wrote back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me
He said, ""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I love your Grandma so.

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said,

""If you get there before I do
Don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through
I don't know how long I'll be

But I'm not gonna let you down
Darling wait and see
And between now and then
Til I see you again

I'll be loving you
Love, Me.""

I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away
In the doorway of the church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray
I know I've never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her, his eyes fill up with tears

My favorite winter coat

I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?

It's time that I realize

And a washed-out dream

Di Scherling,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence

Never been loved,

The missing piece always trying to fit in.
The shattered heart,
Hungry for a home.
No you're not alone,

Maybe we can rip off the bandage.
Maybe you will see it for what it is.
Maybe we can burn this building,
Holding you in.

Do you hear the sea?

But next spring came crawlin' on its knees.

You couldn't fit inside my suitcase,

Sometimes I wish that I could turn the clock around.

I convinced me if I loved you, I'd leave you, I was lying.

Just to feed the birds
And do you still have that old napkin you took home from the cafe,
Where I wrote those 3 words?

You couldn't follow me to LA
I should have never took that job
Now three years have passed and I still feel so robbed

Waiting for you to lose
Have you ever felt like you’re living in a spot light
Searching for the real you
Tell me have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes

Where you can’t even trust a smile

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you’re feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

Don’t kick the chair
It’s gonna get better
Don’t kick the chair
It can only get better

Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You’re gonna have to say goodbye

And you’re feeling short of breath

She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land,

Hide and seek from dirty eyes. Hey hey hey!

She doesn't understand that love is what you give, not given up.

That still wander the path of the electric sun

Success
Love and joy
Death
So hollow
Fragile

They dance until the time is near
The surface they dance on collapses
What a shame... I won't be there

Meek embodiments of suicide
Enjoying while I abide
You may bathe in your ""purity""
But there will be the day when I take it all away from you

As you don't belong - Here or there
And be prepared for all I bear

Your soil will be thrown away but my sky shall remain
Dearly injected, infected, packed pain

Swept my Thirst into Shades of Gleams
It Spread a Rain of Ethereal Tunes
Coloured my Pictures so Freezing Cold

By the Shelter of the Night the Pale Silver Eye Returned
In the Distance of the Nordic Light the Inverted Horizon Burned

A Woven Bridge between the Sunken Lands was Forged
Twisted my Longing into Caskets of Time
It Opened the Eternity of a Cosmical Maze
Coloured my Pictures so Dusty and Old

Beside the Vast Snowy Woodland
Beside the Enormous Hillsides of Frost
Below the Magnificent Starsky Black

In Nocturnal Midwinter Hours
In Bloodred Darkness Gone

The Vision - I Saw
The Scent - I Knew
The Oath - I Swore

I am the Will who Kill for the Bloody Sake of Death

I am the Blade which Slits a Throat to End another Breath

I Bring terrible Demise
Spill Misery over their Lives
I Make sure Evil will Rise
To End more Meaningful Lives

I am the Hater

Diabolical Masquerade,"Upwards a shimmering nightsky
Of far so distant starlight
Above the obsolete horizonlines death came to reap
Towards the cosmic hillsides beyond the lunar galaxy
Closing down the fleshworld
Forever as the soulside awakes
Whirling down a maelstrom of horror infernal
Possessed by the grim and bleak eyes
Of the seventh moon..
Breathing the rippeling rhythm of the coldest night
Through shadows hearses must be led across
The puzzling constellation of a deathrune
The ancient sign of magic
Divine and flamboyance burning
Old dusty thresholds and rusty gateways
Unentered and unseen
A spiritpath in the thirteenth dimension
Cursed for evilcraft
Obstreperous skyways of nightfall ornaments
Cloudrealm corridors of miles and miles with mist
Solarlight trapped into the blackest corner of universe
The darkened space enthroned
And time is moving backwards..
Breathing the rhythm of the coldest night
An ancient sign of magic divine
A darkened dungeon for the pale I seek
A spiritpath for the thirteenth soul
The sky is raised from a nightfall dream
By the bodies with their souls in black
Burning close in the cryptic night
Rip young hearts out in the fields of light
Horror infernal - The seventh moon - The coldest night
Her world described - The deathruler's sign
Flamboyance burning - An ancient deathcry
Old dusty thresholds and rusty gateways
Unentered and unseen..
Obstreperous skyways of nightfall colours
Oblivious to a spiritpath breathing of doom..

My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 

Oh, I'm up before the birds 
Groundhog day, let my dreams replay 
Good morning, am I really awake 
Or am I lost in the moment in the dreamy state 

Thinking back to the days when it was all simple 
Sap, hip, politics, no big issue 
Win some, lose some, go and brush it off man 
But now days everybody's got it twisted 

No time to love but plenty of time to dis you 
Why they miss you, I see the way 
Yeah I, yeah I'm a dreamer, a true believer 
Pray for better days hoping things will change 

So I, let the sun shine wash away the pain 
Live to see the day when my kids can say 
It's been a long time coming through 
The change in the air and it all feels good (we made it) 

I, day dreaming every day 
My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer

And I'm a dream, I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer 
He says not possible, I don't believe ya 
I live my life, live my life to the fullest 
I walk around, all peaceful like a Buddhist 

So check me out, if your mind is a mess now 
You always tryna hide that you're stressed out 
Man, you need to chill out, take a deep breath, 
Think what it's really bout 

I, remember when I was a child 
I was so wild, couldn't keep me in the house 
I'd be out all day playing in the park 
My mum called my name every time it gets dark 

Cause I come from a place where you only get nightmares 
People shout it down so you never put it out there 
Keep it to yourself, and that's what it's best kept 
This is the recipe, behind my success, so

My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 

I, day dreaming every day 
My head's so far away 
Excuse me when I say 
I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 

I'm sitting in a room and I'm daydreaming 
How this success is a strange feeling 
Will it all last? Or will it all pass? 
And all this random sh*t that my brain deals with 

Yeah, I got my head in the clouds 
Random raps, got the phone out to get it all down 
Thinking bout the next show and expecting a crowd 
Too excited, got a Valium to settle me down 

Spent years home at mum and dads messing around 
But now my favorite part of it is my parents are proud 
Never listen to the hater if you getting me down 
And no words are ever stopping me progressing my sound, no 

Stay positive, I do prefer this 
Looking forward to the things that I can do with my kids 
And I'm thinking bout flying to the moon to work this 
Cause the sky ain't the limit, yo the universe is, and

Because I like you much, too much
You have a way with you
You ought to know now

Diahann Carroll,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

Diahann Carroll,"From ages to ages the poets and sages,
Of love glorious love always sing,
But ask any lover and you'll soon discover,
The heartaches that romance can bring,

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone
Diahann Carroll,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

Oh the days dwindle down
To a precious few

And these few precious days
I'll spend with you.

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
Id like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire

Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my

In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and
I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and
I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth with holding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life
You are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and
I was singing this song for you

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Nobody's heart belongs to me today

Vas-y crie le si t'a la haine
Dis-le si c'est la merde en bas de chez toi
Mais de toutes façons ce sera la même

J' risque une balayette pour un sac Gucci
J' suis qu'une victime moi qui voulais la paix

Qu'on m'arrache mon portable avec le sourire
Et que lorsqu'on m'agresse
J' suis incapable de courir
J' vis dans la crainte
Que dans mon verre il y ait de la drogue
J'évite les rues la nuit car le viol est à la mode
Sinik m'a dit tu sais ici c'est la merde
Pour t'en sortir il faut une patate d'enfer
Ou un grand frère
J' vis dans la crainte
Ma bombe lacrymaux dans la poche
J' suis parano
Car y a trop de haine quand on m'approche
Y a trop de mecs fonc-dés au crack dès le matin

Quand moi j' rêve d'amour, de famille et d'accouchement
Certaines trouvent le courage de porter plainte pour attouchement
Dur à croire comme quand j'ai vu ma sœur en sueur
Un inconnu, un couteau, une fellation dans l'ascenseur
Ça pue la vérité parce que mes yeux en sont témoins
J' suis là, juste là crois pas que je revienne de loin
J' t'ai bousculé je t'ai dis ""pardon""
Tu m'as dis:""vas niquer ta race""
""Mais j' t'ai dis pardon!""
Tu m'as mis un point dans la face
Alors maintenant quand on t'attaque ben t'es docile
Plus rien m'étonne vu que même un boulanger est pédophile
Trois petites garces sur M6 ont dit que les blanches couchaient facile
Hé cousine vas y avoue que tu tapines
C'était juste un puzzle de mots et de pensées
Que cette putain d'ambiance repose en paix

D'ailleurs les keufs ils étaient où pour mon histoire de sac à mains?!
Tu me traites de ""chienne"", de ""tinpe"", de ""salope""
Mais mec pourquoi tu t'énerves j' t'ai juste dis que j'ai pas de clope!
Elle voulait pas, mais tu l'as baisée pendant des heures
Hé tu rigoleras ou pas quand ils vont violer ta sœur?
Et des images j'en ai encore des tonnes
Regarde ta mère elle perd son job car elle veut pas sucer son boss
Bref sur ce j' crois que j' vais m'arrêter là
Mais j'oublie pas que pour un Diam's on pourrait me couper le bras

Une bombe et même un missile

Tu veux m'cerner j'rap mieux qu'toi et ta bande
Directe quand tu m'écoutes ferme-la cash et abandonne
Donc diam's, diamant, diamant j'vais lui mettre un perfect

Est ce que tu conteste c'est pas ha hin, qu'on m'est pris dans ce contexte
Moi c'est suzy! Yo! J'vais la rabaissé, l'humilier, des vannes par milliers
J'vais la ciller, j'vais la plier

Logiquement j'devrais même pas rentré dans le jeu mais c'est plus fort que moi
J'devrais même pas car c'est dangereux imagine quelle me sorte moi
Et puis j'm'en fous des polémiques
Si la fille elle m'pose et m'nique
Moi j'm'en fous du clik moi je pose haut les flic

Mel assieds-toi faut que j'te parle, j'ai passé ma journée dans le noir
Mel je le sens, je le sais, je le suis, il se fout de moi

Mais Vi' arrête! Tu sais ton mec t'aime
Ton mec m'a dit ""Tu sais Mélanie, Vi' c'est une reine et je pourrai crever pour elle""
Faut pas que tu paniques, j'te jure ton mec assure, ton mec assume, Vi' ouais
Ton mec est pur, il te trompe pas, j'en suis sûre

Non mais tu n'sais pas toi, ça fait deux mois que j'sens son odeur (quoi?)
Qu'elle laisse des messages tous les quarts d'heure (mais non!)
J'ai infiltré son répondeur (mais non!)
Mon mec se tape une autre femme ouais

- Et tu sais quoi d'elle, t'en as la preuve formelle?

Elle s'appelle Andy, fille de la nuit, elle a un mec qui vit sur Saint-Denis
J'ai pas fini : je les ai vus ensemble mardi
Et je suis sûre que là tout de suite il est avec elle
J'ai même l'adresse de l'hôtel

J'étais à côté de la plaque, je croyais que ton mec était intact moi
Pas de trucs bizarres, pas de plans drague, pas de pétasses
Je croyais que ton mec était à part, qu'il parlait mariage et appart'
Prends ton sac, l'adresse de leur rencard et viens on va les voir viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (calme toi Vi' ca va aller)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (vas-y gare toi là)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

Ok reste discrète, donne-moi le cric, la bombe lacrymogène
Vite, donne-moi une clé, donne-moi sa plaque
Que je la raye sa BM, que je la crève sa BM
Que je la saigne comme il te blesse sa BM
Si tu savais comme j'ai la haine là

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (Vi viens sort de la voiture viens!)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (mais si viens)
Tu crois quoi? Que j'veux pas?
(J'ai demandé c'est la chambre 203, mais si on va monter viens!)
J'y arriverai pas (Ok c'est au 2ème étage)
Je ne sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle

- Vas-y tape
- Ouais 2 secondes, j'arrive

Mais qu'est-ce que tu fous là?
J'te croyais chez ton père mais tu te fous de moi
J'ai toujours été droite et j'vivais pour toi
J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi
Et toi t'oses baiser cette chienne

- Mais calme-toi chérie, calme toi
- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe là, qu'est-ce qui se passe bébé? Mais qui c'est elle?

Mais ferme ta gueule toi
Et si tu veux parler s'teuplaît rhabille toi
Franchement t'as pas d'honneur, t'as pas honte de toi?
Prends ton string et casse-toi
Les filles comme toi ne méritent pas plus qu'un petit bout de trottoir

Mais ferme ta gueule toi aussi, regarde-toi t'es en calçif' putain
Tu fais le mesquine mais tu viens de briser mon amie, oh
T'es pas un homme t'es qu'une victime
T'as un problème avec ton slip ou quoi?
Putain vas-y Vitaa, on se casse d'ici viens

Je n'crois pas, je n'peux pas (arrête de pleurer, s'il te plaît)
Tu sais j'ai peur moi (viens ma puce viens)
Je n'sais pas si j'assume de le voir avec elle (rentre dans la voiture viens)

Non mais je rêve Mel
Je l'ai pas vu avec elle et c'était pas sa BM
Non c'était pas cet hôtel

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa
C'était bien son cab', c'était bien lui chambre 203
Vitaa, c'était bien ton gars dans les bras d'une petite pétasse
Garde garde le sang-froid, ce bâtard n'est rien sans toi
Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ
Regarde-moi après les drames que j'ai vécus, j'y croyais plus
Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)

Tout les moyens sont bon pour trouver l'homme de sa vie",Jeune Demoiselle
Diam's,"Marine,
Tu sais ce soir ça va mal,
J'ai trop de choses sur le coeur
Donc il faudrait que l'on parle,
Marine,
Si je m'adresse à toi ce soir
C'est que t'y es pour quelque chose,
T'as tout fait pour qu'ça foire.
Marine,
Dans le pays de Marianne,
Y'a l'amour,
Y'a la guerre,
Mais aussi le mariage.
Marine,
Pourquoi tu perpétues les traditions ?
Sais tu qu'on s'ra des millions à payer l'addition.
Ma haine est immense,
En ce soir de décembre.
Quand je pense à tous ces gens que tu rassembles.
Tu sais,
Moi j'suis comme toi,
J'veux qu'on m'écoute.
Et tout comme toi,
J'aimerais que les jeunes se serrent les coudes.
Marine,
T'as un prénom si tendre,
Un vrai prénom d'ange,
Mais dis-moi c'qui te prend.
Marine,
On ne sera jamais amies
Parce que ma mère est française
Mais qu'je ne suis pas née ici.
Marine,
Regarde-nous,
On est beau.
On vient des 4 coins du monde
Mais pour toi on est trop.
Ma haine est immense quand je pense à ton père.
Il prône la guerre quand nous voulons la paix.

Donc j'emmerde...
J'emmerde...
J'emmerde qui ?

Marine,
Tu es victime des pensées de ton géniteur.
Génération 80 on a retrouvé notre fureur.
Marine,
T'avais l'honneur d'être proche de l'ennemi,
D'installer un climat paisible dans nos vies.
Mais Marine,
T'es forcément intelligente.
T'as pas songé à tous ces gens que t'engraines dans l'urgence,
Marine,
T'es mon aînée et pourtant je ne te respecte pas,
Il m'a fallu faire ce choix.
Marine,
Tu pouvais briser la chaîne,
Prendre la parole et nous rendre nos rêves.
Mais Marine,
T'as fait la même connerie que lui
Penser que le blanc ne se mélange pas à autrui.
Marine,
On ne s'ra jamais copine parce que je suis une métisse
Et que je traîne avec Ali.
Marine,
Plus j'te déteste, mieux je vais.
Et plus je proteste et moins nous payons les frais.

{au Refrain}

Marine,
Tu crois vraiment que t'es dans le vrai ?
Que t'as su saisir ta chance,
Et que ton avenir est tracé.
Marine,
Je ne suis pas de ceux qui prônent la haine,
Plutôt de ceux qui votent et qui espèrent que ça s'arrête.
T'as fais couler ce navire Marine,
J'ai peur du suicide collectif des amoureux en couleur.
Marine,
Pourquoi es-tu si pâle ?
Viens faire un tour chez nous c'est coloré, c'est jovial.
Marine,
J'aimerais tellement que tu m'entendes,
Je veux bien être un exemple quand il s'agit de vous descendre.
Marine,
Tu t'appelles Le Pen,
N'oublie jamais que tu es le problème
D'une jeunesse qui saigne.
Viens, viens,
Allons éteindre la flamme,
Ne sois pas de ces fous qui défendent le Diable.
Marine,
J'ai peur que dans quelques temps tu y arrives
Et que nous devions tous foutre le camps

J'avais confiance en toi j'pouvais crever pour toi

T'as un problème avec ton slip ou quoi?

Non mais je rêve Mel
Je l'ai pas vu avec elle et c'était pas sa BM

Non non tu ne rêves pas, ton mec était bien là-bas Vitaa

Ben ouais la vie est une garce quand t'as décidé d'être droite
Fallait peut-être que tu passes par là, retour à la case départ

Et puis l'amour m'est tombé dessus, je vis le bonheur absolu
J'y croyais pas, j'étais la femme la plus cocue de Paname
Mon ex était dealer de came, je le croyais dans le social
Crois-moi, tu sais ce que c'est de se sentir trahie
Quand ton mari a sauté toutes les michtonneuses de Paris
Et regarde-moi, aujourd'hui, j'ai presque la bague au doigt
Alors après tout ça s'il te plaît Vitaa ne désespère pas

Mais qu'est-ce t'en sais toi?
Peux-tu m'dire ce que fait ton mec et à quel endroit? (Arrête Vi')
Ce qu'il fait de ses nuits quand t'es pas là?
Et dans quels bras il court étouffer ses péchés quand t'es avec moi?
Es tu sûre qu'il est fidèle? (Mais oui)
As-tu consulté ses mails?
Fouillé son MSN? (Non j'suis pas comme ça)
Capté ses messages, questionné sa mère
Quand elle a dit qu'il est chez elle et lui qu'il est chez son frère?
Si t'es sûre de toi (bah quoi)
Alors prends ton téléphone, écoute son répondeur et tu verras!
(Mais Vi' t'es fatiguée, t'as la haine, arrête s'il te plaît)

Je vais le faire pour toi, (mais raccroche j'te dis, raccroche putain)

Diamanda Galás,"Sadly one Sunday
I waited and waited
With flowers in my arms
All the dream has created
I waited 'til dreams,
Like my heart, were all broken
The flowers were all dead
And the words were unspoken
The grief that I know
Was beyond all consoling
The beat of my heart
Was a bell that was tolling

Saddest of Sundays

Then came a Sunday
When you came to find me
They bore me to church
And I left you behind me
My eyes could not see
What I wanted to love me
The earth and the flowers
Are forever above me
The bell tolled for me
And the wind whispered, ""Never!""
But you I have loved
And I'll bless you forever

Diamanda Galás,"I went out to the insane asylum
And I saw my baby out there.
I said, ""Please, come back to me, baby,
What in the world are you doing here?""
Then my old man raised up his head,
Tears were falling down from his eyes,
And these are the things

That my old man said:
""When your love has ceased to be
There is no other place for me.
If you don't hold me in your arms
I'd rather be here from now on.
Some people have it half way there,
Without your love I ain't nowhere.
I can eat and I can sleep,
I can even rest in peace.
Please take me as your slave,
And save me from that earthly grave.""

Then sorrow struck my heart,
Tears began to fall down from my eyes.
The only man that I had ever loved in all my life
Out here, in a place and a condition like this.
And I began thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little girl.
She told me when I couldn't help myself
To get down on my knees and pray.
And I fell down on my knees

And these are the words that I said:

Save me, save me, save me, dear.""

Only killing shows killing doesn't pay

Even though we make mistakes
Sometimes send the wrong woman to the chair

In the death row waiting for their turn
No time to change, not a chance to learn
Waiting for someone to call
Say it's over after all
They won't have to face the justice of the chair

Just before they serve her one last meal
Shave her head, they ask her how she feels
Then the warden comes to say goodbye
Reporters come to watch him die
Watch him as he's strapped into the chair

And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer
Be brave my daughter, the Lord is waiting there
Oh, murder is so wrong you see
Both the Bible and the courts agree
That the state's allowed to murder in the chair

In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed
The finest lawyers' fees are paid
And a rich man never dies upon the chair

How could they?  I knew they sat there
And called true love a crime (this is what killed me)

You know why? Because in my heart I knew, oh yes, baby I knew
That they would find you guilty too

If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life

She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees

Took some niggas from DC to the spot and they came and cracked a knot
And left the spot real hot, check it out

Reading a books, slef-entitled ""The World According to Scamas?""
Yo herbals make the world calmer
True fact, no drama, old timers still smoke like farmers
I done heard many tales about the chunky black
Guess that's why I prefer the chunky black
Every day I'm reminded bout the dangers of smoking
8 o'clock I'm rolling L's, by 8:03 I be coughing
Rehab spots ain't for herb smokers
That's for extremely stressed stock brokers
Who bought four closers from a crack quoters smoke this
If you're offended by the fumes light an incense
She's not laced with infringements or buddhas
She wouldn't have the gall to fool us, please no intruders
She stays true to her students
Stayed loyal til I tamed her up
Took a trip to the greeny green kid and never gave her up
That's why

 ""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)",Never
Diamond D,"Yeah. Uh. Joe crack the don!
Ton' Sunshine. Terror, uhh
Terror squad, its our time!
Uhh, yea, hand it ova
Uh, yo, uh-huh, what, yea, uh... woo

Yea, mami jus like that bend down grab ya ankles, do it for crack
Damn should be illegal how that ass so fat
The way you shake yo shit make me wanna cop back
Is it ya motion causing all this commotion?
Forget niggaz you even got bitches approaching
Who am I? I'm just a kid from the Bronx
If you love hip-hop you might of heard my shit once
Or maybe twice or like thirteen thousand times
I'm sick of it myself I'm loving the shine
Who else could it be but the squad's O.G?
Be laid up Wit chicks that resemble ?
Half black, Japanese n something
Menages, orgies believe me its nothing
The girls want tha facts got to feed 'em the lies
Who else can have you swimming in wealth the blink of an eye?

[Chorus]
Big trucks, gee rides, we fly, twenty-fo' won't you sit in them tires
Believe me its nothing
G-4 ? Just won't mix with my ride keep a strap on my side
Believe me its nothing
Fast women, bad bitches, down hoes, hood rich, pitch up in Daddy's hooood
Believe me its nothing
Big trucks mean rides we fly t-squad our time
Believe me is nothing

Drop from Harlem even, more for Brooklyn
Still got my Name covering the walls in central Brooklyn
Haters want me, they love to slut me
Mad because my fat ass stay - living comfy
Down in d-are on the landing strip
When record sales get low we back to advancing bricks
Jack-of-all-trades we do that too
The only rapper get the Suge Knight effect when he come through
When pun died, half of y'all cried
The other half wanna See my demise
It was inevitable the sqaud'll reach new heights it's unforgettable
Follow the don is all we kept telling you
Once you down with the squad you can never give up
No need to get ya jewel's back, let them other crews do that
It's so ironic that I'm under fire I'm like 'mine'll get better one time' you dick blowers

[Chorus]

No ya, not dreaming, it's not a visage
It's just another platinum plaque to add to my garage
Ten years in the game - and still going hard -
Fuck a club we flood the studio wit broads
Uh, my whole life never been more focused
Joes the don ask Jennifer Lopez
What the hell in the world did they do to provoke this?
The newspaper reported the scene was atrocious
And still find the time to please girls
Even get hit on by the chick on Cenas world
We beens about it, y'all dudes is frontin'
Big cars, big chips, big Kris' its nothing",Its Nothin

Now I see his face, I see his smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart
His deeds through ages past, tell of his part

See his face, see his smile
Time to die
Yo-ooh, wo-ooh, noo

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

Time to die
Wo-ooh, oo-ooh, noo

Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights

Didn't know what to do, told him to get away

Well I can't sleep for love
Been waiting for you to call
To say you love me enough

It clouds my head that unhappy night
Please forgive every word
I see it all much clearer now
It all seems so absurd

But my plane leaves at 10a.m.
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know

Call me, baby Call me
Call me, baby Call me

To tell the truth I don't want to go
So say you want me to stay

Diamond Head,"Steely eyes of a silvery people
Walk behind me, with evil intent.
Up to the tower, I stand alone
Stripped of rank before a throne I am sent.

What befalls us in the heat of the night?
What befalls us in the heat of the night?

Before long, behind adamantine doors,
I taste of the wine of their joy.
Through delirium of a tortured mind
Her face gave me strength to this day.

What befalls us in the heat of the night?
What befalls us in the heat of the night?
In the heat of the night

But love deceived me, and in my despair
I recalled the ring once again
Born of Sorrow my cunning revives me,
And I took them with me enchained

What befalls us in the heat of the night?

Your voice, the voice of Canterbury,
Resist your temptations
And look to the wind, for conspiracies, ooh Infamy!

The seed of power now, has grown in size,
Intent to crown his bloody prize,
Ooh, resolute as a King to soar,
The sword of lies he takes to war
To breach the wall and nations fall.

Ambition plays her part, that's clear,
Betrayed is how he'll die,
Dismayed by anguish, cries,
Enslaved by desperate crfimes

Down on Damnation street
You got nobody's love
Down on Damnation street
We got nobody's love
Walking, walking, walking down on Damnation street

Did you ever have a chance of finding someone who needs you?
This world has got itself
And there's nothing for the likes of you and me
Without love

You'll try it, you'll buy it, you'll find it empty
As a stones kiss

Just like your date with Jesus
When you're walking on dead man's feet
Down on Damnation street
You got nobody's love
Down on Damnation street
We got nobody's love
Walking, walking, walking down

Better get on your knees
Humility please
Gotta pray to be free
From the slavery of freedom
Free to be nothing

Of almost everything just to fashion reason out of what
Must have been nothin' at all

Now I can't when exactly I saw through the darkness and into the light
Fantastic as it was it was cool and bright
Like on a steely night of shadows

Still far from home
When I came round
I saw myself on a merry go round
With my heart on the ground
And there I see
The rains coming down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories

Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me
But you can set me free

I won't believe ya neither deceive ya when you say we gotta carry on
'Cause I know the dream is over
The one we shared so long, too long

When we could have been getting on just being friends
And not holding on to the past

Which is just sand
I guess we try to belong
'Cause we have to be strong just to get it done
But I was on the ground most of the time
On a merry go round looking up but going down

And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me

Can you see? The rain beat down, rain come down
But what can we do with a thing like you
A heart with a hard on for ignorance
A child of fools where nothing rings true

In a myth that's cruel, where I see the cross
You see the nail, where you see the mytsery I see the failure
And it's bringing me down, I'm just a clown
On a merry go round looking up but going down

And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
A spider fingered vice all sugar and spice

Runnin' down my face feelin' like black rain
Clawin' under my skin and running through my veins
Like a poison I must suck just to change my luck

Watch it count down to the end of the day

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so

I can't help myself I love you and nobody else

Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do

Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

Diamond Rio,"Screamn' whitewall tires and a guitar by his side
Billy's got the fever as he rolls on through the night
Some were born to listen, some were born to play
He was lightning on the high strings and thunder on the bass

[Chorus]
He could play it high, he could play it low
He could make it cry, he could make it moan
He knows when push comes to shove
The proof's in the pickin'

In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat
Conley was the master, the undisputed king
He'd ruled the town for thirty years
With an army of six strings

[Chorus]

Sometimes after midnight Billy drives through New Orleans
Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room
Opened his case and started a tune
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered ""Go son, go""

[Chorus]

Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound
And he handed Bill his old arch-top and stepped into the crowd
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad
Then he made it talk and in came the band
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned.

You used to brush my mind with tender thoughts
We could say it all and never talk
But lately our love's only flesh and bone
I don't know where it went to but it's gone

We used to light the darkness up,
Make love without a touch
Be ourselves and never be alone,
Somethin' lived between us then

But like the wind I guess it just moved on

You're leaving town on a one-way street

But you're gonna have to learn it
It's a long cold swim up against the current
And somewhere down the line
You're gonna have to turn it around

But fade away as you cross the county line
Running from trouble or from the truth

But you turn around and find that it's twenty miles back

Diamond Rio,"His eyes are greener than the meadows
His hair is greyer than a ghost
His lungs are blacker than the shadows

You see them every Monday morning
Electric halos light their way
Five days of widows mourning
But Friday rolls the stone away

[Chorus]
Kentucky mine, doing time
Never see the light of day
Kentucky mine, stand in line
Just to dig your own grave

From coal dust they make a living
To coal dust they will return
The earth is good but unforgiving
And someone's got to keep the fire burnin'

Do not follow where my footsteps lead""

Diamond Rio,"Sometimes a careless word 
Just rolls right off my tongue
No matter what I do 
It leaves you all undone.
Hey baby, no need to go crazy 
Over some little thing I've said
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart?
Even when I lose my head

[Chorus]
We've still got it no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits.

Hey, just look at how far we've come 
By choosing to stay;
Baby, don't go there, 
Love don't get nowhere walkin' away
Sometimes the whisper of love 
Gets lost in the angry shout
Even hearts that are in this deep 
Might think about an easy way out
One honest touch makes those worries 
Just fade like stars at dawn
These occasional moments of weakness
Only makes our love more strong

Steaming up his old heap
Two lovers stare up at the stars
Somewhere in the lights below
Two houses all aglow
Parents wondering where on earth they are
'Cause their folks have tried to tell them
This is way too serious
And while their mommas are waiting up they're

Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'

A few years and some wedding vows
A quarter-acre and a little white house
More than they can well afford
And those easy payments are getting tough
All the overtime ain't enough
Still they couldn't ask for more
'Cause that old hill that they've been climbin'
Might be gettin' steep
Oh, but they don't seem to mind it they keep

Holdin', lovin', kissin', huggin'
Come whatever may they keep
Goin', dreamin', smilin', believin'
That nothin' matters like this love they're holdin'

They know the most important lesson they can teach

Diamond Rio,"Momma died young giving birth to a son
In a home for wayward girls
Daddy was sidewalk, soapbox preacher
Looking forward to the end of the world
Every Friday night he'd pick a Jesus fight
Down at the local pool hall
Racking up souls condemning all those
Caught behind the eight ball
He said I preach for the light 
The light shows the way
Don't ever trust what the government say
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead

Lucy was a messed up, dressed up waitress
With a slightly tarnished heart of gold
She wasn't half bad for a new step momma
As far as step momma's go
Daddy knew she was the one 
As he baked in the sun
In a parking lot preaching the truth
Up shot her hand and she cried, oh, man
I feel it, yes, I feel it I do
It's been revealed to me down deep in my soul
There were two shooters on the grassy knoll
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head
Let us sing

It's all interpretation
To find the truth 
You gotta read between the lines
Work out your own salvation
That narrow path is hard to define
Heaven's more than a place
It's a state of mind

In his quest for truth
Daddy was moved by the spirit
To take up a snake
In a moment of doubt the venom turned out
Stronger than daddy's faith
But I'll never forget his dying breath
The last words that he said
We never walked on the moon
Elvis ain't dead
You ain't going crazy
It's all in your head
Let me tell ya

It's all interpretation

With a ring two hearts find common ground

Sharing a moment only lovers can
And sitting on a Greyhound all alone

She misses their Wednesday night dinner out
As soon as he got home from work
And Saturday morning sleeping late
Holding each other close
But she misses him on Sunday the most

She sits alone on that same old pew again
His tenor voice still echoes now and then
It brings back all those memories

Diamond Rio,"She made her exit a month ago tomorrow
Called up her mama and asked if she could borrow
Enough money to leave for awhile
Mama said you always were impulsive child
She bought a ticket at the Greyhound station
Said she needed a permanent vacation
Ran out of money by Santa Fe
Hitchhiked the rest of the way

And she blew into town with a runaway heart
Like a Santa Ana blowin' down Ocean Boulevard
Everybody said she was a restless one
Never knew where she was going but
She sure did like to run

She took a job with a bucket and a wet mop
Saved her pay checks and bought an old rag top
She'd crank it up and let her hair down
They'd hear her coming for miles around

And she blew into town with a runaway heart
Like a Santa Ana blowin' down Ocean Boulevard
Everybody said she was a restless one
Never knew where she was going but

She wouldn't tell me but I think she was south bound
She waved good-bye and looked back and smiled

He drives a baby blue A.M.C.
Ain't missed of day of work in 13 years
He's a fire department volunteer

He's got a yard that's always just been mowed
Collected stamps since he was 10 years old
You've never seen a more regular guy
But when the sun goes down on Friday night

Puts on his Elvis jacket custom-made
Gets in his patent leather zebra boots
Fires up his super sport Malibu

Attention shoppers there's a two-for-one buy
Tuesday afternoon he mans the wheel
Makes his round in the bookmobile

Thursday's the tourney at the bowling lanes
His friends would freak out if they only knew
The party animal he turns into

I don't use five dollar words
This might not sound like much compared to all the pretty things you've heard

It's like just before dark
Jump in the car
Buy an ice cream
And see how far we can drive before it melts kind of feelin'
There's a cow in the road
And you swerve to the left
Fate skips a beat and it scares you to death
And you laugh until you cry
That's how your love makes me feel inside

It might not be suitable for greeting cards and such
But it's a true and honest feeling
And if you feel it half as much
We could go through life together without a worry or a care
Knowin' deep down in our hearts
We've got something special there

Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead.

You knew all my tricks
You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix

Lay beside me for a moment that lives on
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone.

Looking back it's still surprising
I was sinking you were rising
And with a look you caught me in mid air.

Now I know God has his reasons 
But sometimes it's hard to see them
I lie awake and find that you're not there.

You found hope in hopeless
You made crazy sane
You became the missing link that helped me break my chains.

I know my way around this land
Around every curve and bend

It's like flying down these old back roads
I could do it with my eyes closed

We'll kill the motor when we get there
I'll pull the ribbon from your hair
We'll lay up on the hood and I can stare at you all night
And you'll say when we're over that hill
Are you gonna love me still
Well baby you know I will

Said I wish that I was stronger

A wish was granted just for me
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished for one more day with you!

One more day, one more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again, I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you
One more day

First thing I'd do is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone and keep the t.v off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do with one more day with you

One more day, one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you

One more day, one more time
One more sunset maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day
Leave me wishing still for one more day with you.",One More Day

Play me something blue

Diamond Rio,"She says, you know the monkey bar rules
As she kisses away his playground bruise
You don't have to skip a bar each time
To make it to the other side
She picked him up from out of the sand
And ties his shoelace that read ""superman""

'Cause we all fall down

She says, I know what you're goin' through
As she talks to the door of her daughter's room
Your heart feels like it's been broken in two
But baby I'm here for you
The door opened and she stepped inside
She put her arms around her and said, it's okay to cry

Cleans out his desk and heads on home
Sees his kids out playin' in the yard
Been a while since he's been hit so hard
He's as scared as a man can be
He tells his wife and she says, honey look at me

Diamond Rio,"Gettin' out of the tub all drawn up like a raisin
Showed my fingers to my Daddy while he was shavin'
Said look at my toes Dad what's wrong with my skin
Will this go away, will I be normal again

Well he picked me up and set me down on the hamper
Wiped off his face while he gave me the answer
For the first time I noticed the lines in his grin
As he dabbed a little foam on the end of my chin, he said

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Son, you're still young, you're gonna be OK

Well, I walked down the hall, saw my Mom gettin' ready
For a long over due date, dinner with Daddy
She was cussin' those crows feet, didn't know I was listenin'
Started talkin' â??bout her younger years
And how much she missed them and I said

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Mom you still look young, you're gonna be OK

As I get a little older, I'm startin' to get a few
And I'm sure I gave Mom and Dad at least one or two
We're all gonna have â??em, there ain't no doubt
But those wrinkles in life ain't nothin' you can't iron out

Diamond Rio,"Up and off to work again, 
Going through the motions
I bet she tried to warn me 
And I didn't even notice
'Til I got home and found her gone
Left with just a letter
Folded with a key on top
Sitting on the dresser
I opened it
It simply read

Look and you will find me
I won't be that far
I'll be right here 
Waiting for you with open arms
I don't want to live without you
But I can't go on like this
Torn between the man I love 
And the one I'm living with
It's a conflict of emotion
To my heart I must be true
I know that I need you
But you have to need me too
So if you get home 
And miss me in your life
You'll find me

I called her family 
Asked everyone who knows her
Telling them in detail 
All the things I should have told her
How much she really means to me 
And how much I'm regretting
But so far no one's heard from her 
And all that I am left with
Is how I let her go 
And the letter she wrote
Saying you'll find me

I spent the next eight hours wondering 
Where on earth you were
It was getting late, I was getting tired 
And growing more concerned
When all at once it hit me, 
That piano bar back home
Where I asked you to marry me
And there you were alone

I knew I would find you
And how it warmed my heart
To see you right there 
Waiting for me with open arms
Said I don't know where I'm going, 
But I can't go on like this
The thought of life without you 
Is something I just can't live with
It's a conflict of emotion
To my heart I must be true
You told me that you need me
Well, girl I need you too 
So if you come home 
And want me in your life
You'll find me
You'll find me
You'll find me",You'll Find Me

To keep our paths from crossing

I always wondered what I'd say
Would I tell you that life is great?
I'm getting better all the time
Really lookin' up

Could I be too proud
To show my heart?
Well, to tell the truth
It's not that hard

I'm still not over you
Still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And to hear you say, you want me, too

You're the one for me

Baby, I'm still not
Over you getting over me

Guess I'll never be
Over you

So there it is, I've said it now
God I wish some way somehow
You'd look at me, start to cry
Say, you missed me too

But you moved on
I understand
Yeah, I tried that too
But here I am

I'm still not over you
Still the only thing I wanna do
Is open up my arms and reach for you
And to hear you say, you want me, too

Diamond Rio,"She had trailer park charm, he carved her name in his arm
Then he slept with the waitress from the bar
Then she took a chain to his car
And broke the windows on the love they had, redneck love gone bad

He got all liquored up, tried to hot wire her truck
Next thing he knew, he was seeing stars
While her daddy knocked him all around the yard
Oh, what a night they had, redneck love gone bad

'Round and around the blue lights go
Everybody's smoking and watching the show but it's over now
There's twenty-three versions of this story
Some say her love just drove that boy insane
But to me it's plain, redneck love gone bad, oh, pick him redneck

He's going with her mother now
Every Friday night we see them cruise through town
A few months back, she ran away, with a truck driver named Jose
She's happy and he's so glad, redneck love gone bad

Droppin' bass like a cello, shakin' like Jell-o
I wear and tear a sucka from here to there
Put my rhymes in 5th gear and yo, I'm outta here
You beat the Shell?  C'mon, picture that
Hey yo I never been beaten and hey, that is fact
At my house I got a six shooter loaded with rhymes
Waitin' for the right second then I'm goin' for mine
Put my hands on the handle, my finger's on the trigger
Pull it and get smooth on a nigga
Yo, let's make this clear so you know
Diamond Shell be doin' brothers just like a pro
Toe to toe we can go blow for blow, and yo
If rappin' was the Last Dragon, I'd have to blow

Look who's back again

Back is the incredible
Back is the incredible
Back is the incredible

Now let's see, what do Shell mean to me?
It means covered, protected quite well, purely yo
I got the mic that starts damage doin'
When it's time for rap awards, the Shell is just a shoe-in
You brag about this and that, blasé blah
But do you want to battle with Shell?  You better say, ""Nah""
Yo, but that's alright 'cause you a backwards beaver
Diamond Shell ain't got the time to toy with you either
Come one come all, either big or they tall
But the bigger they are, the harder they fall
Could Shell be the whackest of rappin' yo that's a never
If you think you that you could ever ever, ever
Compete with the Shell at rappin' you must be buggin'
Hard on the crack, in other words druggin'
People give a cheer to the brother of the year
Paper thin emcees step back cause I tear or rip
Sendin' you on a trip so get a grip or come equipped
Or yo get that ass flipped, look who's back again

Once again, back is the incredible
Once again, back is the incredible
Once again, back is the incredible
Once again, back is the incredible

She'll be doin' damage on your FM mode
So, pump up your radio and watch your box explode
I'm smooth as a pimp, boppin' hard with a slant
Who? Shell, got more juice than a power plant
As I step to those who try to ruin my rep then
I grip the neck with five fingers of death then
I do the job like hired help
And I'ma rip whole crews by myself and whoever else
Come in sit down, have a seat while I wreck this
My diseased rhymes and the crowd perfected
Sucker emcees they much as jack
'Cause I'ma eat whole crews like a pancake stack
You want to try me, well then, you must not know
The power I possess behind the mad freestyle flow
Swift I go, fast or slow, or maybe even baby yo
A hype medium tempo
A vandal, I graffiti papers with ink pens
Slap your rap so take off and stay strapped in
Yeah, I'm comin' back like a bald man's hairline

Bound for destination anywhere
Had the whole world at his window
It seems so long ago from there
Now he's building cardboard castles in the air

Does anybody know
Does anybody care
Over here, over there
Building cardboard castles in the air

Diana DeGarmo,"Within these empty walls, 
I've been talking to myself again 
You don't hear a word 
Why bother to explain it when 
You say that I should try 
But I feel that I'm half alive 
And the rest of me is somewhere else 

I wish the world would just spin faster 
Get to my happy ever after. 
You're looking at me, 
You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference, 
The difference in me. 

I don't wanta fight 
Don't care whose right or wrong anymore. 
I'm sick of all this pain 
Can it be the way it was before 
When I always made you smile 
Seems it's been a while 
Cause now you're always out of reach 

I wish the world would just spin faster 
Get to my happy ever after. 
You're looking at me, 
You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
(L: the difference, R: the difference in me) 

You say that I should try 
But I feel that I'm half alive 
And the best of me is somewhere else 

I wish the world would just spin faster 
Get to my happy ever after. 
You're looking at me, 
You're waiting to see the difference, 
The difference in me. 
And you keep telling me to grow up, 
But why should I, it's never good enough 
How could I be when you never see the difference, 
The difference in me. 

I changed my hair 
And I doing my clothes 
And you say that you see but you don't notice the difference, 
The difference, the difference in me. 
I am the same as I was before. 
I'm not afraid to walk right out that door. 
See the difference, the difference in me.",The Difference in Me
Diana DeGarmo,"Do me a favor 
And tell me what you think about me 
Tell me how you want this to be 
Go out on a limb and just dream 

Paint a picture 
Choose your colors extra wise 
Especially what you put on my mind 
Fill me in so I can fly high tonight 

Woahooo your thoughts are gonna lift me up 
Do you know its good to want too much 

[Chorus]
Oh you've got my head in the clouds 
And oh you've got me comin' around 
The more you think about me 
The more that I believe 
That nothings ever out of reach 
So dream dream dream 

I breathe your visions 
They pull me through the coldest of nights 
They steer me towards a moment in time 
When you show me what it means for you to be mine, Yea 

Whoaooo your givin' me the will to try 
And you know there's desire in these eyes 

[Chorus]

Hah, it's like my birthday 
Every time you look at me 
I feel the earthquake 
Every time that you dream 

Whoaooo your thoughts are gonna lift me up 
Do you know, its good to want to much, much 
Oh you make me dance in the rain 
And oh I want to love once again 
The more you think about me 
The more that I believe 
That nothing's ever out of reach 
So dream dream dream 
Dream 

The more you think about me 
The more that I believe 
That nothing's ever out of reach 
So dream dream dream

Diana DeGarmo,"Sometimes I get emotional
Sometimes I do some stupid things
Something I say what I should keep inside

Sometimes I'm sad about everything
Sometimes I'm mad and break some things
Sorry times ten but you just got in the way

Don't give up now
Running away
I won't hurt you
Sometimes I'm just a pain
And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you
Life is always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared to leave me

That's when I feelâ?¦ emotionalâ?¦â?¦

You say I'm just impossible
Totally unpredictable
I'm just a girl, get used to it
No big deal

You can't change me
Why would you try
I'm no angel, but I can make you smile

And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am

Sometimes I feel like crying
Laying down and dying
That's when I need you

Life is always easy
But sometimes I'm just scared to leave me
That's when I feelâ?¦â?¦ emotionalâ?¦..

Don't give up
I won't hurt you
Oh, sometimes I'm just a pain

And that's the way it is
That's just the way I am


That's when I need you
Life is always easy

That's when I need

I need you

Sometimes I getâ?¦â?¦ emotionalâ?¦â?¦.",Emotional
Diana DeGarmo,"What goes around
Comes back around
Seems that's the way
Heartache falls

I learned to live 
Without you by my side
But I prayed
For the day you'd call

So why don't you
Lie down beside me
Open your heart
And confide in me

[Chorus]
Go on and cry
Here's my shoulder
Why don't you try
To imagine that I even care
Go on and cry
On my cold shoulder
You left me so sad
And you hurt me so bad
It's your turn to 
Cry cry cry
Over me

You say you made
A big mistake
When you threw away
The love I gave

I always knew
You'd come around again
Looking for the love
We made

[Chorus]

Sometimes love
Is overrated
It can be so hard
To find a cure

And when a heartbreak
Is understated
It comes back around, I'm sure
Oh,oh,oh

[Chorus]",Go on and Cry
Diana DeGarmo,"I get into the car
Turn the radio up real far
To shut out the noise
So I can hear my voice

There's a party on down the street
But nobody invited me
'Cause I got a gig
Babysitting my uncle's kids
Why me
Whoa is me

Don't they know that
I'm a hip hop queen
And a rock and roll dream
It's all bling bling 
I'm the star of the scene
Yeah check me out, see what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want
And the one you can't have
The girl that you call
That doesn't ever call abck
Just look at me, I've got everything
But then I woke up

I was lying on the couch
Drool coming out my mouth
Turned on the T.V.
Dr. Phil won't you please fix me

Waiting for the phone to ring
Flipping through a magazine
Why doesn't he call
Guess I'm the loser down the hall

Why me
I just want to sleep

back to chorus 1

But then I woke up
I like living in a dream
It's every thing it's supposed to be
It's a holiday for me

It's all just kickin' in
And this is where I begin
Just being me
It's okay to be me

But it's fun to be a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream
It's all bling bling yeah baby ca-ching
Come check me out
I'm bringing down the house
I'm the one that you want
You know I'm heaven sent
I'm a little Lynyrd Skynyrd
A little 50 Cent
Just look at me
I've got evrything
But then I woke up
I woke up

Diana DeGarmo,"Don't tell me you want me 
Cause you don't, today. 
I woke up this morning knowing that, I've changed. 
That look in your eyes 
What a surprise to hear that you felt the same. 

I want you till you want me 
When I have you I feel, yeah, empty inside 
It's not what I thought 
It's like I've been caught between the dream of you 
And the reality of me. 

I want you till you want me 

You're ready to show me where this all can go. 
But now that I've got you I'm not in control 
Cause I can figure this out. 
I'm so full of doubt. 
I just want to to turn and run away. 

I want to tell you what I mean 
When I have you I feel, yeah, empty inside 
It's not what I thought 
It's like I've been caught between the dream of you 
And the reality of me. 

I'm getting over that we were once meant to be 
Cause when I see you I'm numb 
It's like I just freeze 
There's something about you that makes me think 

I want you till you want me 
When I have you I feel empty inside 
It's not what I thought 
It's like I've been caught between the dream of you 
And the reality of me.

Diana DeGarmo,"Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passin' by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about 'er 'cause, you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside, learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
The different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothin' left but sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher-that was me-I told 'er

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost made it

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside and learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall, remember you almost had it all",Don't Cry Out Loud
Diana DeGarmo,"Dreams are just dreams
When it's dark inside your head
And all it takes is a little help from you
You know it's true
That dreams are for real
When you see what I see
And you feel it too
We took the longest road
Just to make it harder
Let's do it all again
It only makes us stronger

[Chorus]
Dreams
I guess we're just made of dream
Nothin' else matters
As long as we believe
I'm lookin' at you
And I see my life
Passing before my eyes
And when the journey's over
And all my dreams come true
I'll dream of you

What do you see
When you look inside your heart
A little thought
Can walk a thousand miles
And change your life
When dreams lead the way
The impossible is suddenly in sight
Every step you take
Just brings it all together
You gotta keep the faith
When all seems lost forever

[Chorus]

You're the one
That keeps my hope alive
My vision clear
I'll spend my life with you
Conquer fear
We'll make it through

Nothin' else matters
As long as we believe
I'm lookin' at you
And I see my life
Passing before my eyes
And when the journey's over
And all my dreams come true
I'll dream of you
I'll dream of you
I'll dream of you",Dreams

And did you find your pot of gold
Ever catch a shooting star
And tell me how high did you soar
Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake
And the magic that surrounds you
Will lift you up and guide you on your way

I can see it in the stars across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
See I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally
I Believe

When you look out in the distance
You see you never was at fault no
Heaven knows of your exsistence
And lets you to be everything you are
Oh there's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's that hope that love can save the world
And oh we should never let it die

I can see it in the stars across the sky, yeah
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize
See I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally, oh

I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream fall apart
See I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
Cause anything is possible
When you believe

I can see it in the stars across the sky, ohh Yeah

Now I finally realize
I've waited all my life for this moment to arrive
And finally I believe

All alone. 
Standing here, with you,
Now I see.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

See I had it all worked out
To get you back as my man
To have her in my way

Wasn't part of the plan
What is this I see, a new
Shinning diamond ring
Are you sure she has no secrets

'Cause I've heard so many things
Was it so easy, to leave me 
And find somebody new
You'll be sorry, without me

I'd still be loving you

Still be wanting you
Looking in your eyes
I see our children's children
Sure as the sun will rise

Together we shall see them
But if this can not be
Time won't change

If only you knew
I'd still be loving you

Diana King,"Here a story 'bout a girl I know
Rolls around like she got the flow
But everybody in the hood they know
Her money didn't buy those clothes
Sugar daddy with a pocket full of green
Picks her up in a back limousine
If he treat her like a beauty queen
She'll let him in-between

[Chorus]
She wants the suga, suga
To give her everything that she dream of
Want a suga, suga
She want the ice and cash and the beamer
She don't wanna work, she jus' put on a short skirt
Lip gloss and a cutoff T-Shirt
Suga, suga, she want the money, money, suga money

Everyday she wake up in the afternoon
Turn on the TV and watch cartoons
Another hour getting pretty in the bathroom
She won't be looking for work anytime soon
No you may hate her, but that don't faze her
Who are you to criticize her behavior
She don't wanna be all up in love
She don't want no broke ass man
She gonna get it all while she's young
You gotta understand

[Chorus]

She got the Stoly and the Roly and the furs
And if she want it then it's gonna be hers
She's a playa and she knows how to play
While we fools be working all day
She says, ""I don't wanna be all up in love
I don't want no broke ass man
I gotta get it all while I can
That's just the way I am""

And that happy tune is your step

Every time we have a date
But I love him
Yes I love him

I am going to walk right up to his gate
To see if I can get it straight
Cause I want him
Oh yes I'm gonna ask him

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
The way your acting lately makes me doubt
You have always been my baby, baby
Seems the flame in your heart has gone out

Well a fellow is a creature
Who has always been strange
Just when you think you're his
He's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Has my baby found somebody new

Or is my baby still my baby too",Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?
Diana Krall,"Never trust the stars
When you're about to fall in love
Look for hidden signs before you start to sigh

Never trust the moon
When you're about to taste his kiss
He knows all the lines and he knows how to lie

Just wait for a night
When the skies are all bare and then
If you still care

Never trust your dreams
When you're about to fall in love
For you're dreams may quickly fall apart

So if you're smart
Really smart
Only trust your heart",Only Trust Your Heart

Just squeeze me

Sing the blues most everyday
Counting the nights and longing for you

I'm in the mood to let you know

Diana Krall,"Once I had a man, sweet as he could be
Once I had a man and he was right for me
Kind of curly hair, eyes so soft and true
That you couldn't help but care
When he looked at you
He called me baby
Baby all the time

He said, ""Baby can't you see?""
""Baby understand?""
""Baby you're for me""
""Oh won't you take my hand?""
But I push him away
Wouldn't let him near
Pushed him far away
And now I'm wishing I could hear him
Call me baby, baby all the time

It's so lonely through the day
Lonely through the night
Lonely, lonely hours without that
Man I held so tight
Lord I pray that you will listen to my plea
Keep him close to you so he'll come back to me
And call me baby, baby all the time
Baby, baby all the time","Baby, Baby All the Time"
Diana Krall,"A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turn to me
The gypsies say and I know why
A falling blossom only touches lips that lie

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new
Beneath the moon
I thought you'd love me
You said you love me
We planned together
To dream forever
The dream has ended
For true love died
The day a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied",A Blossom Fell
Diana Krall,"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigalette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered dreams
And gigolo and gigalette
Awake to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigalette
Still sing a song and dance along
Boulevard of broken dreams",The Boulevard of Broken Dreams

For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off, start all over again

Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again

Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired but you'll be a man my son

They picked themselves up, dust themselves off and started all over again",Pick Yourself Up
Diana Krall,"When I look in your eyes, I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes 
I see the sadness of a thousand goodbyes 
When I look in your eyes 

And it is no surprise, to see the softness of the moon in your eyes 
The gentle sparkle of the stars in your eyes 
When I look in your eyes 

In your eyes, I see the deepness of the sea 
I see the deepness of the love 
The love I feel you feel for me 

Autumn comes, summer dies 
I see the passing of the years in your eyes 
And when we part there will be no tears no goodbyes 
I'll just look into your eyes 

Those eyes, so wise 
So warm, so real 
How I love the world, your eyes reveal",When I Look in Your Eyes

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain
But, all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
Let me see, I think that's all
Nothing more for me to say
And so I'll close but, by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you

The girl in the other room
She ?
Adjusting the strap of her gown
She tosses her tresses
Her lover undresses
Turning the last night life down
What's that voice we're hearing
We should be sleeping
Could there be someone who's weeping
Maybe she's there
Maybe there's nothing to see
Just a trace of what used to be
The girl in the other room
She darkens her lash and blushes
She seems to look familiar",The Girl in the Other Room
Diana Krall,"I looked down at a sparkling band
And only saw my Mother's hand
The things I've earned
They never came too cheap

But then the likeness only goes so deep
As clouds approach the facing shore
And although two pairs of shoes sit by the door
I can't pretend I don't descend
I know I should be joyful now
But time means nothing
Only the love you gave to me can save me

I think she knew
I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through

I looked down at a twist of lace
And only saw my Father's face
The things we shared

Have hurt us both so much sometimes
We each go places love can't touch
A calendar marks days to keep
The moon shone down

Upon chill waters running deep
The veil so thin that light poured in
The sight was so astonishing
That time meant nothing
Only a kiss that felt like this cloud move me

I think she knew
I raise my voice
And shake the walls
But if I chance to cry at all
I hope you hear me now
I'm coming through",I'm Coming Through
Diana Krall,"I'm pulling through and it's because of you
When I was stranded came your helping hand
Lonely, hurt I had not known which way to turn
'Til you said, ""Try smiles, not tears, just laugh and learn""

I'm pulling trough and it's because of you
You made me see how lovely life could be
Lifted up my heart and made me count the cost
To find I'd gained, not lost

When I thought that hope was really gone
You showed me I was wrong
And you taught me how to carry on
Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for your song

I'm pulling trough and it's because of you
I'd do the same for you if your turn came

Diana Krall,"An invitation came my way
Knowing it's dangerous to follow
That girl in her Sunday suit
Would have forbidden it
But since those days
I've changed my address

I sit alone and drink it in
Practicing blowing up smoke rings
I learned of the sadness
The beauty and bitterness
But since those days
I've changed everything

And sometimes they would light it up
I ran my hands down silent keys
For secrets like these
And ever since
They turn up on my fingerprints

I'm driving back across the bridge
Red light is hitting the rear view
And he'll wonder whether
Blonde hair cascades on black leather
Since then I've changed my address

Accessory after the fact
I walked back in where I started
The bar plays the sports news
To drown out the old ghosts that I knew
Oh well, I've changed my address

And as I departed
I only took what I needed
I guess I've changed my address",I've Changed My Address
Diana Krall,"The men that I've been seeing
They got their soul up on a shelf
You know they could never love me
When they can't even love themselves

And I want someone to love me
Someone who really understands
Who won't put himself above me
Who just love me like a man

I never seen such losers darling
Even though I tried
To find a man who can take me home instead of
Taking me for a ride
And I need someone to love me
Darling I know you can't
Don't you put yourself above me
You just love me like a man

They all want me to rock them
Like my back ain't got no bone
I want a man to rock me
Like my backbone was his own

Darling I know you can't
Believe it when I tell you
You can love me like a man

Came home sad and lonely
I feel like I want to cry

And I need someone to love me

Diana Krall,"Narrow daylight entered my room
Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?

I walked through halls of reputation
Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through

Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?

I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again

Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone

I stood there in the salt spray air
Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old
Wooden cross
It's a place where I can find some peace

Shining hours were brief

Better days so long ago

I think my little ship has run aground
I feel like I'm in the wrong place

Won't you stop this game, deal me out I know too well what it's all about
I know too well that it had to be

Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

I think of when I had none at all
And I fall asleep, counting my blessings

I think about a nursery
And I picture curly heads
And one by one I count them
As they slumber in their beds

If you're worried and you can't sleep
Just count your blessings instead of sheep
And you'll fall asleep counting your blessings.

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kid is knocking him down.

You're the one that I adore
It's so crazy there's just not a choice
My heart beats just to hear your voice
Do you wonder why it makes us cry everytime we say goodbye

Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've felt and I've seen and I've heard

Funny how when you are younger
You just giggle at a farewell kiss
I never knew it could be like this
The way you're watching from the outside
You can see what's in a soul
I guess that loving someone makes us all

Catch your breath and I'll catch mine
Why does it feel like the end of the world
I've felt and I've seen and I've heard",Everytime We Say Goodbye
Diana Krall,"Este seu olhar quando encontra o meu
Fala de umas coisas
Que eu no posso acreditar
Doce sonhar, pensar que você
Gosta de mim como eu de você

Mas a iluso quando se desfaz
Dói no coração de quem sonhou
Sonhou demais, ah se eu pudesse entender
O que dizem os seus olhos

Mas a iluso quando se desfaz
Dói no coração de quem sonhou
Sonhou demais, ah se eu pudesse entender
O que dizem os seus olhos",Este Seu Olhar
Diana Krall,"Every time we say goodbye, 
I die a little,
Every time we say goodbye, 
I wonder why a little,
Why the god's above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, 
There's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, 
Begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, 
But how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

Diana Krall,"The torch
I carry
Is handsome
It's worth
It's heartache
In ransom
And when
The twilight
Steals
I know how
The lady
In the
Harbor feels

When I want rain
I get
Sunny weather
I'm just as blue
As the sky
Since love
Is gone
Can't pull
Myself together
Guess I'll hang
My tears
Out to dry

Friends
Ask me out
I tell them
I'm busy
I must get
A new alibi
I stay at home
And ask myself
Where is he
Guess I'll hang
My tears
Out to dry

Dry
Little teardrops
Hanging on
A string of dreams
Fly
Little memories
My
Little memories
Remind him
Of our
Crazy schemes

Somebody said
Just forget
About him
So I gave
That treatment
A try
Strangely enough
I got along
Without him
Then one day
He passed me
Right by
Oh well
I guess
I'll hang
M1y tears
Out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry
Diana Krall,"I can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do.
I could never see tomorrow,
But I was never told about the sorrow.

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again.

I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by.
We could never see tomorrow,
No one said a word about the sorrow.

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again.",How Can You Mend a Broken Heart [*]
Diana Krall,"I've grown accustomed to his face
He almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune he whistles night and noon
His smiles, his frowns, his ups and downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to his looks, accustomed to his voice
Accustomed to his face

He's second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air
Accustomed to his face",I've Grown Accustomed to His Face
Diana Krall,"Quiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet cords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us

Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window looking on the mountains and the sea how lovely
This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember

I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence
Oh my love

This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only

The meaning of existence
Oh my love",Quiet Nights
Diana Krall,"Someone to hold me tight
That would be very nice
Someone to love me right
That would be very nice
Someone to understand each little dream in me
Someone to take my hand and be a team with me
So nice life would be so nice
If one day I find
Someone who would take my hand and samba through life with me

Someone to cling to me stay with me right or wrong
Someone to sing to me some little samba song
Someone to take my heart and give his heart to me
Someone who's ready to give love a start with me
Oh yes that would be so nice, nice
Should it be you and me
I could see it would be nice

Someone to cling to me stay with me right or wrong

Diana Krall,"You're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words 
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough
I mean they're just not swell enough

You're much, too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's dictionary 
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
To tell you that you're marvelous
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and also very, very
To ever be in Webster's dictionary 
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous

Tell you that you're marvelous

Diana Krall,"If you see me walking ddown the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by
Walk on by
Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private
Cause each time I see you I break down and cry
Walk on by.

I just can't get over losing you and so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride that's all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me when you said goodbye
Walk on by.

If you see me walking down the street and I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by

Make believe that you don't see the tears
