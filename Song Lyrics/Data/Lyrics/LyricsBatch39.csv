Daniel Dyer,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)
Daniel Guichard,"La tendresse c'est quelquefois
Ne plus s'aimer mais être heureux
De se trouver à nouveau deux
C'est refaire pour quelques
Instants un monde en bleu

Avec le cœur au bord des yeux
La tendresse, la tendresse
La tendresse, la tendresse

La tendresse c'est quand on peut
Se pardonner sans réfléchir
Sans un regret sans rien se dire
C'est quand on veut
Se séparer sans se maudire

Sans rien casser, sans rien détruire
La tendresse, la tendresse
La tendresse, la tendresse

La tendresse c'est un geste
Un mot, un sourire quand on oublie
Que tous les deux on a grandi
C'est quand je veux te
Dire je t'aime et que j'oublie

Qu'un jour ou l'autre l'amour finit
La tendresse, la tendresse
La tendresse, la tendresse

La tendresse, la tendresse
La tendresse, la tendresse

Allez viens",La Tendresse
Daniel Guichard,"Elle s'appelait Anna rappelle-toi 
La plume courait entre ses doigts 
Elle écrivait des mots d'amour et de foi 
Car elle avait treize ans, Anna 

Elle se cachait dans un grenier Anna 
Si chaud l'été, l'hiver si froid 
Un horizon de quatre murs et un toit 
Elle écrivait pourtant, Anna, ces mots-là 

Moi j'ai un jardin rempli de fleurs 
Un monde d'amour tout en couleur 
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur

Elle avait souvent si peur, Anna 
En écoutant les bruits de pas 

Des pas qui s'approchaient trop près quelquefois
Trop près de son grenier, Anna chante-moi 

Moi j'ai un jardin rempli de fleurs 
Un monde d'amour tout en couleur 
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur

C'est par un beau matin d'été, je crois 
Qu'ils sont venus chercher Anna 
Ils ont laissé juste un cahier, les soldats
Un journal dont les mots, Anna, sont pour moi

Moi j'ai un jardin rempli de fleurs 
Un monde d'amour tout en couleur 
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur
Que je fais vivre en mon cœur",Chanson Pour Anna
Daniel Haas,"Another day gone by
And still no reason why
You say goodbye but then you cry
A million miles apart we lie

I opened every door to you
I put all my trust in you
You took advantage of it why?
Was every word you said a lie?

[Chorus]
It's just another day, that didn't go my way
It's just another day
'Cause times change, your mind's rearranged
You walked away cause you started feeling strange
You knew from the start that this wasn't for you
But your feelings can't control, the things that you do
That you do

I sit in here with all this fear
Empty thoughts and a blank stare
Trying to find, a reason why
The ones you trust, are the ones that lie

And was I wrong, for trusting you
You said you just don't know what to do
When you're with him, you think of me
Cause change means losing security

[Chorus]
It's just another day, that you're living life this way
It's just another day
'Cause times change, your mind's rearranged
You walked away cause you started feeling strange
You knew from the start that this wasn't for you
But your feelings can't control, the things that you do
That you do

You say there's too much past with him
You can't throw it all away
But the past is all you have with him
History means security
That's what I say, it's just another day

[Chorus]
Cause times change, your mind's rearranged
You walked away cause you started feeling strange
You knew from the start that this wasn't for you
But your feelings can't control, the things that you do

'Cause times change, your mind's rearranged
You walked away cause you started feeling strange
You knew from the start that this wasn't for you
But your feelings can't control, the things that you do
That you do
It's just another day",Another Day
Daniel Hiribarrondo,"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

Please don't be blue for the present,

Daniel Hiribarrondo,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street
Daniel Hiribarrondo,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Daniel Hiribarrondo,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Daniel Humair,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

And I am here to say (how ya doin'?)
I'm gonna make you smile, and I will brighten up your day-ay
It doesn't matter now (what's up?)
If you are sad or blue (howdy!)

To make me happy as can be

Come on and smile",Smile Song [Buddygirrl Remix]
Daniel Iorio,"I know that absence might 
Make the heart grow fonder
Or is it ""out of sight
Out of mind"" I wonder
And do you yearn for me
When the nights grow cold
Til death us do part
To have and to hold
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're up at John O'Groats, I'm down in Land's End
On you I depend

I see your face 
When I close my eyes
And there ain't no place
Like between your thighs
Don't want a life alone
All by myself
To honor and trust
In sickness and health
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're at the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben
It's driving me round the bend

Forever and ever
And ever, amen
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But is it just me or am I all on my own again
You're in the Vatican, I'm in the Yemen
And it feels like the end
The end",Is It Just Me?
Daniel J,"I love her converse rip piece
And the way she looks at me
No one does it better I swear
She wears her hair down makeup
She don't even need that stuff
Taking picture everywhere

And I would fight
I would run
I would fly
Into the sun

'Cause I never met a girl like you before
You don't think you're perfect
But you're everything I want and more
And I'll try to make you mine
Cross my heart and I hope to die
I never met a girl like you before
I never met a girl like you
Met a girl like you before
I never met a girl
Met a girl like you before

She wears her headphones rolling stones
They write all her favorite songs
Dancing around like she doesn't care
She got a tattoo who knew
That she's got a boyfriend too
But he don't even know that I'm there

And I would fight
I would run
I would fly
Into the sun

'Cause I never met a girl like you before
You don't think you're perfect
But you're everything I want and more
And I'll try to make you mine

Daniel Jacobs,"I know there's pain
Why do lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?

Daniel Jay Paul,"Once upon a time, there was a girl
She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved",Once Upon a Time

Painted over many times

The poet rambles
The world it scrambles
But who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men

Your shadow knows
It's right behind you all the way
Your shadow knows where you've been

When you know you don't deserve it
You are not here today

My yoke is heavy

Sacred is the smile
That opened up my mind
That may at last please save me
And rid my cold, cold heart
Of the dark deep gloom
That took up so much room
In my many spacious memories

And many are the times
I thought and rethought
The thoughts you got me thinking

Though the sun shines bright upon me now
And I am young and kicking

Dropped his last dime in a wishing well
But he was hoping to close and then he fell
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

He was always polite to the people who'd tell him
That he was nothing but a lazy bum, but
Goodbye to them he had to go
Now he's Casper the Friendly Ghost

Nobody treated him nice while he was alive
You can't buy no respect like the librarian said, but
Everybody respects the dead, they
Love a friendly ghost

And now they say we'll never forget what he learned
As we were mean to him but he never burned
Just singing, ""love lives forever!""

He'd look at the floor, scribble on gum wrappers
He never found a better way to joke around
The clock would tick and time would slow
There wasn't anywhere he wouldn't go 
To avoid having to see anyone
He'd sit in a chair and lean against a wall

But late at night he had a savior
In his sleep, in his dreams
She came to him and she said
""Poor you, poor you
No one understands you
Poor you, poor you""
And every word that everyone would say
Got mumbled up in his head
Like mumble-jumble and everywhere he went
It seemed like everyone was saying to him,

She's a girl who might just drive you sane
And the stars shine bright on a dark Texas night
And she's as sweet as candy cane
And your mind unwinds
She's so very kind 
And you'd swear you're melting on the floor

She's so precious
She's so luscious
She could make you happy
She could set your soul free
She's the only one you've ever talked to this way
And all of a sudden you may find
That you have something new to say

She's a foxy girl
Don't you know you love her so
It makes you feel like letting go
And the stars shine bright
On a dark Texas night
Don't you know she loves you so

Led me to the holy river baptism

Bloody battle, fight to the finish

Daniel Johnston,"well, he's a space orphan from Long Store 6
Left to rot on Cyborg 9
He was trying to find his way to Planet X
But stepped on a land mine
He only lost his third leg
But he'd never beg or put anybody down
And behind the great walls of China
Underneath the galaxies
He had a studio
And he wrote this song

Oh Daddy don't you know
I'm gonna get some soda pop
Oh Daddy don't you know
I'm gonna have some candy bop
Candy bars, ice cream sodas and licorice
And jelly beans and ice cream and soda pop

And I'm at the end of my rope
It's so tough just to be alive
When I feel like the living dead

I'm living my life in vain
And where am I going to?
I got to really try
Try so hard to get by
And where am I going to?
I don't know where is up or down
And there ain't any love left around
Everybody wearin' a frown
Waiting for santa to come to town
You're giving it up so plain
You're living your lives in vain
And where are you going to?
You've got to really try
Try so hard to get by
And where are you going to?

And try to make sense of that
If we were all in the movies
Maybe we wouldn't be so bored
We're giving it up so plain

And where are we going to?
You gotta really try

Asks me how my day go go
Tells me good luck and spits on my shoe

Up walked a girlfriend

Said you had the gall to bring my name up again
Looking for salvation
We had an ice cream soda
I said have you ever wondered
What became of Uncle Bill?

We was peeling potatoes
Bcak in World War II
And we was playing that rock 'n' roll
After school for you know who
Hidden from the public
It was behind the scenes
There was a relic
They called the purple haze

I was eating a taco
I looked across the room
I saw a girl in a red dress
She said she'd like to do me in
I left the waiter a tip
I scrambled for the door
I said you might have loved me
But now there's nothing more
She's always on my trail
She really likes to kill
I keep her lovely picture
On my window sill

I was a cowboy without a show
I was like the kind of guy
You'd never really know
You won't forget me
No mater how hard you try
And when it's my time to go
I'll wave goodbye

Or am I a little crazy for you

If there's no love I just can't believe it

I couldnt stand to chance without you

you said the love was dead
And in my head
I just couldnt believe it

and on the phone you said
You never knew me at all

thought there was love

you don't understand

Daniel Johnston,"It was love at first sight 
When I talked to her 
It was the beginning of a real good time 
All I knew was her 
And when I came around 
Love had lingered on my mind 

She said on the telephone 
She wished me well. 
So alive with a spell 
Until I hung up early 
I've realized 
I've been dead for so long 

All my memories of her 
Like a fading light I suffer 
Thinking of our love for so long 
Back in the early days 
I saw a lot of her 
She was the coolest girl in town 

And when I saw her standing there 
Everything was all right 
I took a journey in my mind 
And as I saw her beauty 
She was so kind 
That was a good time 

Everyday we met it was wild 
I felt like a child 
I loved to see her smile 
And as I played piano 
I was so inspired 
I always had a real good time 

And when last we met 
I just can't forget 
I took for sure I love her bad 
I just can't ignore 
Her loving response 
I always knew she'd be all right

She made me think I was okay 
And the love seemed so real 
I still got feelings for her 
And when I'm on tour 
Singing about her forever 
I'll remember blessings
And the good times we had

I really tried to play the game of love 
And I hate to loose 
Maybe I can win somehow 
And so I'll dream of her

Then you might just see it's not so funny

Prey tell
The wishing well will get you eventually
Beware
What you are is what you're doing there

Love is lingering with you on it's mind
And it's giving you a moment so kind

Believe
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

As we stare into each other's eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It's all over as the sun does set once more

If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

Just smile
You can win the victory so sweet
And know
It's just another day for you and me

And tomorrow ? no more sorrow
You can all her - if you want to

There's a new way ? why won't you try it
Heaven sent it and you'll believe it now

Love can save you now
Love can save you now
Love can save you now

It's too late to suffer through

Just let me smile a while, for real. 

And when the evening comes 
I'll be on the run

Like a psycho hot as the sun

Daniel Johnston,"Me and a friend went out one night
Walkin' in the street
We talked of God and the end of the world
I stuck my head in a fire hydrant

The night was cool. It was around the time that the bad ladies come out
While river rats broke windows and performed un-natural acts
We walked halfway across the town and sang in an amphitheater
Then we walked a little further and admired some graffiti

Dodging cars as we crossed the highway
We sure must have looked ugly
My shirt was soaked, the grass was wet
I stuck head in a fire hydrant

We talked of things in the Good Book
While there was a naked lady on TV
She had no care, she had no shame
She had little propellers on

My friend he said ""I can't help
But look at this naked lady's body""
I said ""dear friend you got a dirty mind
Stick yr head in a fire hydrant""

Earlier that evening
I went to a banquet
Hoping she might be there
But she wasn't so I went to this other girl's house
Who was freaked out on drugs

So later after that
After the first part of this song
On my way home I drove past this other girl's house
Who would not accept my calls

I noticed she had her light on
As I drove slowly by
I wondered if she noticed me
I stuck my head in a fire hydrant",Brainwash

making plans and holding hands
along came a spider, sat down beside her
and took her to

I had this dream about these angels
I had this dream the other night
it was really weird
they were playing guitars
and getting loud
and they spilt beer on Jesus
I save cigarette butts for a poor girl
across town
I spent a lot of money at the pizza shop
just to watch the waitresses walk
back and forth
I go to school, I'm a college student
I have a secret pocket on the inside of my coat
where I keep this cigarette butt
meanwhile on the dance floor
the loud guitar solo seems to be promoting wild desires
the music has set their hearts on fire with lust
Sure are a lot of cigarette butts layin' around
I thought I'd give her one more chance
so I went over to see her again at her hous
and when I walked in
there was her and him

Daniel Johnston,"I don't have to say a thing
She knows exactly what I want
And anytime I feel like this
What we have goes out for lunch

She looks at me like a gun cocked
And I'm afraid to turn my back
For fear of being locked

She leans forward for me to see
That the lights of her majesty
She's tempting me with a razorblades
But time is money at a penny arcade
And there's forgiving in the shadows
And the birds that are afraid of being laid
The court jester holds up a light bulb and says
All that is made is made to decay


To know her is to love her
And I love her, but I don't know her
To know her is to love her
And I love her, but I don't know her


I feel for a place to sit
Things always go on this way
I'm lost for a little bit
'Til I come up with something to say
Then I'll go on and on
About rat skulls in her lawn
I'll not specifically gonna mention names
Her and I know were just a shame

She knows I'm here
And she readily rebukes her sister
She treats me with a sudden respect
Suddenly she calls me 'Mister'
But just as soon, I soon forget
And start poking around in the trash
Talking myself into outer space
And watching the reactions on her face


To know her is to love her
And I love her, but I don't know her
To know her is to love her
And I love her, but I don't know her

Being her on that chair
I can only say as much as I please
But not as much as I dare
Where is the little girl who fell in love with me
The girl who fell in love with a satellite
That little girl has moved out now
But the satellite still comes around
Most every other night

I think my interest bleeds a heart
Of a dead dog
Lying in her yard
I could catch her standing naked
I could catch her cold
I could catch her breath and bottle it
But I could never catch her off guard

And I go there nowadays
It's like visiting a sinking ship
And I'm a man overboard
And she won't throw me a lifeline
Symbolically represented by her lips

And I love her, but I don't know her

And I love her, but I don't know her

And He had a great idea. 
He built Himself a world 

And He put people on it. 

 
But the people they turned wicked, 
And they soon forgot 

Who had made their very being 
And put them on their planet.

 
So the God He sent His very own Son, 
His only holy Son. 
And He sent Him to the world 

'cause something had to be done. 
 

His son walked around and He told the truth 

Like the truth had never been told. 
He was kind to the poor, 

His home was the road. 

 
Unlike any other heroes 

Of which a song could be sung, 
He never did bad to anyone. 
He never did no harm.

 
But there were other people who weren't so nice 
And they plotted to take His life 
And the Man knew all about it 
But He didn't even hide. 

 
And they beat Him and they robbed Him 
And they hung Him for bein' good. 
And they laughed and made jokes 
While they stood in his blood.

 
But there's a happy ending to the story. 
I think you'll be glad to know 

He came back to life in glory, 
And up from the grave He arose. 

 
So before you turn out your light, 
Remember this one Man 

Who lived comfortably in heaven 
But gave it all up to hang on a cross.

And He came to set us free.

I can't believe he's here 

The he does his famous 
song of sorrow and his melody of pain 
and he bows 
and the curtain falls 

And the white in his eyes 
is reflecting light from the ceiling 
as he prays alone a silent prayer 
to his lover whom he lost 
whom he sings about 
whom he thinks about all the time 
he sits for a little bit 
and then he writes another hit - ohohoh 
",True Grief
Daniel Johnston,"I saw her in the street
She was with her family
She didn't say anything
She just stopped and stared
And I like her

In the summer I worked with her
In an oil refinery
She wore a yellow suit in the rain
And I like her

I drew her some pictures
I made her posters
I let her walk all over me
And insult me too
Cause I like her

She has red hair
And blue eyes
I was looking for love
But all I got was a bite
And I like her
And I like her
And I like her

Daniel Johnston,"Get attached to a rolling stone 
And yr libel to get crushed. 
Yr better off to sit at home 
And watch the toilet flush.

I like to sit and look at her. 
I like to do that so much.
To stand and act mysterious
And to watch her blush.

I know I'm such a weird guy. 
She could never take me serious.
There's always that green monkey
In around or near us.

I think sometimes of holdin' her, 
But the picture gets all blurred. 
I see shadows dancin' on my wall.
Thoughts scatter like birds.

I wish to God i could touch her hand, 
Somehow make her understand,
The man I somehow wanna be,
The man I want her to make me.

But she stands so distant and rolls her eyes.
She leaves me and I don't know why.
Nothing seems to make much sense. 
I cant appreciate the sky.

And so I go home lonely, 
Like a wolf without a pack 
I got nothin to put my love in, 
Like groceries without a sack.

Maybe someday when she gets fat,
She'll think about what she's missed.
She'll know shell never get me back.
She'll feel just like the pits.

She'll sit lonely in her apartment,
Thinkin' about what might have been.
She'll know her man had come and went.
Maybe she'll take me seriously then.

Get attached to a rolling stone 
And yr libel to get crushed. 
Yr better off to sit at home 
And watch the toilet flush.

Raging words, pounding on the sail
Like an angry whale

I felt the iron rudder skip

The heat of slipping rope
Failing hands, failing hope

Asks the question about the cargo

And He spilt the cargo for all to see

You walked up to me and said did I make a mistake
I feel so naked I could use a twist of fate
There's a sermon that I heard the other day,
Confused me so I looked the other way

Daniel Lanois,"Got a letter from a messenger
I read it when it came
It said that you were wounded,
You were bound and chained

You were poisoned, you were pained

You were naked, you were shamed

You could almost touch heaven

Daniel Lanois,"My hands are wrapped in your raven hair
In the faded picture on the back stair
We were narrow, we were steady, trembling and ready
To give it hell in this rocky world

You said do I look like I could be a strong mother?
And raise the good side of a young daughter
In the hotel Shangri La, let me tell you
I've been thinking of her in this rocky world

Chicago is heavy but I can't turn around
I'm smuggling that whiskey over flesh and pound

That I lost you out there in the rocky world

At the top of the hill in the still blue air
Near the weather vane, by the track and train?
I'll be looking for you in the rocky world

She's made a decision to color her hair
The black man cut the sugar cane and she watches the rain
In a building away from the rocky world

Yeah, I'll tell you something I'll never forget
The sight of you in the silhouette
Outside Sault. Ste. Marie, ah you really threw me

I thought of you, way you were playing
I thought of you in my bed

I thought of you there next to me

I looked for you when lights were low

I was in the water, you were dry
You yelled my name now I know why

It's speaking and you listen and the tears don't come out when you cry

Maybe he'll see 'cause he's searching for mama mia

You can't believe that it's now, it's turned itself around
You'll fight to know the way that you look, but you meet him there in town
Oh, the joy and the fear of the unfailable pain

The jackal proud and tight,
In search of you I feel my way,
Through slowest heaving night
Whatever fear invents, 
I swear it make no sense

With reptile tongue the lightning lashes

From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk,

Like there's no one there at all

And the heart it will not be denied

Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific

Where the time and the tempo fly
And there's no exit in any direction
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes
Wasn't making any great connection
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world

In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another

I could not feel for the fear in my life
And from across the great divide, In the distance I saw a light

I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the Maker

Standing there with broken wings

Daniel Lavoie,"L'amour est juste avec les gens
Il donne, il donne, autant qu'il prend
Même qu'il rapproche les continents
Toujours et toujours en mouvement

L'amour est juste un coup de sang
Un coup de coeur évidemment
Chacun vers l'autre l'on se tend
Quand on l'écoute et qu'on l'entend

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Mais on n'pourrait pas vivre sans
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent

L'amour est juste un mur en blanc
Où la vie s'écrit sûrement
Chaque mot, chaque geste lent
Il en fait des petits aimants

L'amour est juste un peu de vent
Qui souffle sur nous doucement
Qu'on soit pareils ou différents
L'amour est un sable mouvant

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Après lui, rien n'est plus comme avant
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent

L'amour est juste un bon moment
Mais pas toujours où on l'attend
Qu'on soit d'accord ou pas vraiment
L'amour nous attend au tournant

L'amour est juste notre enfant
Il naît de nous à chaque instant
Comme on naît de lui tout autant
L'amour est l'amour, simplement

L'amour est juste un sentiment
Un peu, beaucoup, passionnément
L'amour est juste et justement
C'est pour ça qu'on lui ment souvent",L' Amour Est Juste
Daniel Lavoie,"Ils arrachent la terre
A la terre à leurs pieds
Ils tracent des frontières
Pour se les disputer
Ils sèchent les rivières
Brûlent bois et forêts
Font l'été de l'hiver
Inversent les marées
Ils cherchent le profit
Sans même en profiter
Se lancent des défis
Comme on jette les dés
Ils sèment l'injustice
Récoltent la misère
Au bord du précipice
Ils regardent en arrière

Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes
Quand on voit ce qu'ils font, quand on en fait la somme
Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes

Ils se créent des empires
Et des palais de verre
Ils prennent leurs désirs
Pour ce qu'il reste à faire
Ils réclament l'amour
Ne pensent qu'à le faire

Demain pas mieux qu'hier

Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes
Quand on voit ce qu'ils font, quand on en fait la somme
Bénies soient les femmes qui aiment encore les hommes

Ils se donnent raison
Ils se donnent le temps
Exigent le pardon
Mais n'en font pas autant

Daniel Lavoie,"Si je cultive l'Amor, 
Si frénétiquement
Jusqu'à perdre le Nord,
Dans mon aveuglement

C'est qu'au fond de ma mémoire
N'est qu'un foutoir sans nom
D'où seul l'écho répond,
Quand je demande à voir

Dites à l'amour qu'est ""mi amor""
Que c'est pas moi qu'ai tous les torts
Dites à la mort, qu'est sans amour
Que je veux bien laisser mon tour

Si je poursuis l'Amor,
Avec acharnement
Tous mes boyaux dehors
Et mes tripes en avant,

C'est que nos solitudes
Sont de fieffées menteuses
Qui parlent de quiétude
Mais sont des emmerdeuses

Si je parle de l'Amor,
Comme d'une servitude
Un mauvais coup du sort,
Sur un triste prélude

C'est que même la Grande Ourse,
N'a jamais eu le choix
Elle ignore dans sa course,
Qui conduit le convoi

Dites à l'amour qu'est ""mi amor""
Que c'est pas moi qu'ai tous les torts
Dites à la mort, qu'est sans amour
Que je veux bien laisser mon tour

Et si je t'aime, Amor,
D'une insatiable peur
Quand le ciel bande encore,
Quelques semblants d'ardeur

C'est que ma vie est l'entre,
De cette cruche morte
Qu'un vieil enfant éventre,
Et que la terre emporte

Dites à l'amour qu'est ""mi amor""
Que c'est pas moi qu'ai tous les torts
Dites à la mort, qu'est sans amour
Que je veux bien laisser mon tour",He l'Amor

Un train comme il y en a tant

Feux de paille de nos tourments

Ses printemps majeurs
Peut-être mille peut-être cent

Tes cheveux sur ma joue
En filament de lune,
Ton souffle dans mon cou
Vient dissiper l'amertume.
Une larme de tes pleurs
A respirer en secret,
Retrouver ton odeur
Dans le brouillard de mes regrets.

Me couler sous ta blouse
Et sentir sur ma poitrine,
Ton cœur jouer un dernier blues,
Un poème à l'encre de chine,
Dériver sur ton corps
Comme des notes de steel-guitar,
Remonter les courants forts
Jusqu'au récif du regard.

Tes yeux de mauves de louve
Qui s'entrouvent comme un rideau

Sur l'onde calme et noire où dorment les étoiles 
La blanche Ophélia flotte comme un grand lys 
Flotte très lentement, couchée en ses longs voiles 
On entend dans les bois lointains des hallalis.

Voici plus de mille ans que la triste Ophélie 
Passe, fantôme blanc, sur le long fleuve noir 
Voici plus de mille ans que sa douce folie 
Murmure sa romance à la brise du soir.

Le vent baise ses seins et déploie en corolle 
Ses grands voiles bercés mollement par les eaux 
Les saules frissonnants pleurent sur son épaule 
Sur son grand front rêveur s'inclinent les roseaux.

Les nénuphars froissés soupirent autour d'elle 
Elle éveille parfois, dans un aune qui dort
Quelque nid, d'où s'échappe un petit frisson d'aile 
Un chant mystérieux tombe des astres d'or.

II

O pâle Ophélia! belle comme la neige! 
Oui, tu mourus, enfant, par un fleuve emporté 
C'est que les vents tombant des grands monts de Norvège 
T'avaient parlé tout bas de l'âpre liberté.

C'est qu'un souffle, tordant ta grande chevelure 
A ton esprit rêveur portait d'étranges bruits 
Que ton coeur écoutait le chant de la Nature 
Dans les plaintes de l'arbre et les soupirs des nuits.

C'est que la voix des mers folles, immense râle 
Brisait ton sein d'enfant, trop humain et trop doux 
C'est qu'un matin d'avril, un beau cavalier pâle 
Un pauvre fou, s'assit muet à tes genoux!

Ciel! Amour! Liberté! Quel rêve, ô pauvre Folle! 
Tu te fondais à lui comme une neige au feu 
Tes grandes visions étranglaient ta parole 
- Et l'Infini terrible effara ton oeil bleu.

Et le Poète dit qu'aux rayons des étoiles 
Tu viens chercher, la nuit, les fleurs que tu cueillis 
Et qu'il a vu sur l'eau, couchée en ses longs voiles

Daniel Lavoie,"Ils brisèrent leurs ailes à la fin du mystère
A vouloir séduire la belle, faire reluire son regard
Seuls les nobles sangs pouvaient tenter leur chance
Mais pour caresser la belle, il fallait l’affronter

En combat singulier, au sabre ou à l’épée
Elle ne donnait qu’une leçon, la dernière sans remission

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Les nobles furent outrés de cette vaste hécatombe
Il fallait clouer la belle aux tréfonds d’une tombe

Ils se rendirent quérir un bel et noble sire
Tombeur de femmes et fine lame pour enfin la faire périr

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance


Mais entre ces deux-là, un grand courant passa
L’amour vibrait plus que fort, pourrait-il vaincre la mort

Un mystérieux parchemin croisa leur destin
L’expéditive demoiselle en perdit ses ailes
De son adversaire elle partageait le père 
Dans leurs vifs vaisseaux coulait la meme rivière

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Brisera-t-elle son serment, faire rendre gorge aux nobles
Et bien laver dans le sang l’affront fait à sa mère
Délaissé dans la boue en raison de son rang
Son père ce noble salaud l’avait larguée lâchement

Si le sang boit le sang, la vie n’a plus de sens
Si le sang boit le sang, non vraiment plus rien n’a d’importance

Car malgré leur sang mêlé, elle fondit dans ses bras

Où chaque nuit ses rêves espèrent
Depuis qu’elle est partie

Pour la rejoindre au dernier port

L’amour est plus fort que la mort

La nuit s’enfuit quand le chant retentit
En un seul souffle son coeur revit
Il boit cette voix tendre
Il plonge en ses méandres

Suivant l’appel de sa douce sirène
Du vieux voilier il prend les rênes
Prisonnier de ses chimères
Il se perd aux confins des mers

Le chant l’emporte tout droit vers la tempête
Où les récifs lui font sa fête
La barre s’échappe, la coque éclate
Le vent déchire, lacère et frappe

Au bord de l’eau il se réveille
Émergeant d’un lointain sommeil

Freedom's finally mine
I ain't takin' anymore
Yeah freedom's finally mine, It's finally mine
I ain't takin' anymore
Oh, freedom's finally mine

I'd like to throw out this cellular
And kick off these shop-shined shoes
Leave the kids at your mama's
And take off to Timbuktu
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks
Leadin' off to way out back o' yonder
There's no mountain I can't climb
To satisfy this need of mine to wander
Oh, 'cause...

[Chorus]

There's no desert I can't cross
No river too wide
I can do what I want now
'Cause freedom's finally mine

It's finally mine, yeah it's mine",Freedom's Finally Mine
Daniel Lee Martin,"Homespun love, yeah

You spun your spell back a Sunday or two
I ain't never met nobody like the likes of you
Oh, you got me preaching the news

You turned out my road and decided to stay
And I took a like into your smile and your hillbilly way
Oh, and how you kiss on my face

I got a bonny good feeling
You're the star of the good ol' days

Well, I still remember you came by my trailer
With some chicken legs and some homemade wine
The dogs go to barking when we get to sparking
We almost set the house on fire

I get a bad heave from helping
All the stuff I get a hungerin' for
Honey your homespun love
Keeps me coming back for more

I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard
Oh, and I like the notions
That you stick in my head and my heart
Oh, and how you fix on my car

Well, I reckon I'm lucky
You're the best thing I found so far

I still remember you came by my trailer
With some chicken legs and homemade wine
The dogs go to barking when we get to sparking
We almost set the house on fire

Daniel Lee Martin,"I got a little change in my pocket goin' jangle-angle-ang
Gonna call you on the telephone, gonna give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same ol' thing
No huggy, no kissy till you get a weddin' ring

I said, ""My honey, my baby don't keep my love up on no shelf""
She said, ""Don't gimme no lines an' keep your hands to yourself""

Yeah, I said, ""Now, baby, baby, baby, don't you treat me this way
I'm still your lover-boy; I still feel the same way""
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk in a cow
She said, ""No huggy, no kissy till we get a weddin' vow""

I said, ""My honey, my baby don't keep my love up on no shelf""
She said, ""Don't gimme no lines an' keep your hands to yourself""

Yeah, I said I wanted her real bad, an' I was about to give in
That's when she talked about true love an' she started talkin' 'bout sin
I said, ""Well, honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life""
She said, ""No huggy, no kissy till you make me your wife""

I said, ""But honey, my baby don't keep my love up on no shelf""
She said, ""Don't gimme no lines an' keep your hands to yourself""

Daniel Lemma,"Well the time is right, that's what the mighty Duke says
And he lights his pipe with a grin
And the moon so bright, like a neon light
Shines on me & my friend
You can sense the new day, not far away
Like a silent bubble ready to burst
But right here, right now, with 'em crickets lullabies
It's so good to see what it's worth
Feel alive, feel alive, feel alive

It may bring me down in a terrible mood
Waist-deep down in the mud
Put a load on my shoulder, like a five ton boulder
And I can't shake it off like I should
Adversities may line up, can't find a reason to smile
All you want to do is give up, sit right down and cry
But on the positive side, I'm feeling alive
Listening to the Son's of Thunder
Sanctified music from an up-lit hill
Tonight I can't go under
The night comes down on Duke's verandah
And everything, everything is alright

I believe in love like a burning fire
Glowing through my soul
Burning down every distance
So the divided can come to a whole
And if the world don't care for dreamers
That's the odds we'll have to stand
But tonight I ain't gon' worry
Just gon' sit right here with my friend
And feel alive, feel alive, feel alive

It was such a great night , I was full of delight
Glowing just like the Duke's pipe
Trombones sounding off the hillside
And that yellow moon so bright
The night came down on Duke's verandah
And everything, everything was alright",Alive
Daniel Lemma,"Lately things been coming on real nice
I must admit it's a kind 'o surprise
But it feels real nice
I have been thinking about a ring
Me and my baby , we just got through this thing
Now ain't nothing can come between

Anything can happen, any day now
Remember that

You ain't the man, the man with the master-plan

I saw it coming in a beautiful dream
Was like nothing else, yet such a familiar theme
And I think I know what it means

I went down the valley , I went on top of the hill
Made a little wow, not to rest until
The worried blues lay still

Tonight the moon's so bright and you can hear the mockingbird sing
Feel a little mixed up, wondering what tomorrow will bring
But don't worry 'bout a doggone thing",Anything Can Happen
Daniel Lemma,"I clung to a delicate straw
It broke in my hand
Now I'm at the mercy of strangers
In a foreign land
Now I'm waiting on guidance
I'm waiting on a sign
Now I'm running for my life
But there's nowhere to run

The ground shook and rumbled
Rippled miles around
My eyes screaming with terror
But I'm not making a sound

Should we stumble
Should we loose our ways
Much too late now to matter
Now we're lost in the haze

Ain't no two ways about it 
We sank like a stone
Now I'm looking at ashes
And scars cover my bones

Should we stumble
Should we loose our ways
Much too late now to matter
Now we're lost in the haze",Haze

Don't have that many friends
Got so many lovers

In these very walls

Try to find your way to the altar, keep thinking it might be too late

Daniel Mark Faller,"Well, I had a buddy back in '81,
And we made ourselves a pact.
We were headin' for the new pipeline,
We were never comin' back.
Well we worked 80 hours making time and a half,
But La Grange was too damn hot.
We drove back home at the end of that week
And we spent it all on pot.

[Chorus]
So I'll see you in Houston,
If I ever get out that way,
I'll see you in Dallas,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowing down,
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.

Well, I played ball every single fall,
I could run just like the wind.
Went to college like they asked me too
But they didn't ask my friends.
Don't think I seen a single classroom,
But I drank a lot of beer.
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year.

[Chorus]

Now I got myself a little band,
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair,
And I never learned how to dress.
So I'm leaving for the last time honey,
I'm never more to roam.
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home.

So I'll see you in Nashville,
If I ever get out that way.
I'll see you in Austin,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowin down.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.",My Hometown
Daniel Martin Moore,"Across the evening sky
All the birds are leaving
But how can they know
It's time for them to go?

Before the winter fire
I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows
Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore
Your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know
It's time for them to go

But I will still be here
I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows
Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone
While my love is near me
I know it shall be so
Until it's time to go

So come the storms of winter
And then the birds in spring again
I do not fear the time

For who knows
Where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

Across the evening sky
All the birds are leaving
And who knows where the time goes?
And who knows where the time goes?

And when I'm out at sea, I'm gonna write a song for her
I'll sing across the bay, hoping she will hear
Hoping she will hear

I think she's in her car and just above the ?
To hear my serenade reckoning her near

Thinking that you're gonna return
My friends said it over and over

There was nothing to gain
How did I get the blame for it all

You said you didn't feel love

You said that you tried and you tried
You kept telling that lie to yourself

I really thought the pain would pass.
It's been nearly an hour,

It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.

Te vas, a otro lugar

That can take away my memories
Of my travels through the great northwestern
Mountain scenery
With my woman by my side
With her lips like cherry wine
She kissed me, said she loved me
As we crossed the borderline.
CHORUS
Don't you fly away woman of mine
Don't you fade away; don't you be that kind
Don't you fly away woman of mine
Tell me that you love me
As we crossed the borderline.
If you're ever in Alaska, 
Take a message to my friend
That the glamour of the city life
Is as empty as the wind
It'll steal away love's joy;
It'll drive a heart stone blind
Makes a cold Alaskan winter 
Seem like something warm and fine.

Maria, I love you

My Maria, there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind

You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She treats me so right, lady, take me away

Daniel O'Donnell,"Standing in line at the sandwich shop
My eyes browse through the menu then came to a stop
I licked my lips and gave my tummy a rub
Something caught my eye, it was a meatball sub

Meatballs, mozzarella, pepperoni
Swiss cheese, yes please, all served on a hoagie
The cashier asked how I'd be taking this treat
One for here, one to go, and make them both on wheat

I said wait, this should be more Italiano
Take these back and add some Romano
It felt like Burger King 'cause I had it my way
But I was eating fresh 'cause I was really at Subway

All that sauce, all that cheese
All those meatballs, still I'm not obese
I'd be the happiest Italian guy
If I had meatball sandwiches stacked to the sky
Scarf some down and let the music fade
It's the meatball sandwich serenade

Daniel O'Donnell,"Don't look so sad, I know it's over.
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.

Lay your head on my pillow.
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,
For the good times.

I'll get along; you'll find another,
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.

Lay your head upon my pillow,
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,

Daniel O'Donnell,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland, 
Then maybe at the closing of your day; 
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh, 
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay, 

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream, 
The women in the meadows making hay; 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin, 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play, 

For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland, 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow; 
And the women in the uplands digging praties, 
Speak a language that the strangers do not know, 

For the strangers came and tried to teach their way,] 
They scorned us just for being what we are; 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams, 
Or light a penny candle from a star. 

And if there is going to be a life hereafter, 
And somehow I am sure there's going to be; 
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven, 
In that dear land across the Irish Sea.",Galway Bay
Daniel O'Donnell,"Chorus: Ring a ring a rosie,
as the light declines,
I remember Dublin city
in the rare old times.


Raised on songs and stories,
heroes of renown.
The passing tales and glories,
that once was Dublin town.
The hallowed halls and houses,
the haunting children's rhymes.
That once was part of Dublin,
in the rare old times.


Chorus

Oh me name it is Sean Dempsey
as Dublin as can be,
Born hard and late in Pimlico,
in a house that ceased to be.
By trade I was a cooper,
lost out to redundancy.
Like my house that fell to progress,
my trade's a memory.


And I courted Peggy Diugnan,
as pretty as you please,
A rogue and a child of Mary,
from the rebel Liberties.
I lost her to a student chap,
with skin as black as coal.
When he took her off to Birmingham,
she stole away my soul.


Chorus

The years have made me bitter,
the gargle dims my brain,
'Cause Dublin keeps on changing,
and nothing seems the same.
The pillar and the Met. have gone,
the Royal long since pulled down,
As the gray unyielding concrete,
makes a city of my town.


Chorus

Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey,
I can no longer stay,
And watch the new glass cages,
that spring up along the quay.
My mind's too full of memories,
too old to hear new chimes,
I'm part of what was Dublin,
in the rare old times.


Chorus

Daniel O'Donnell,"I've met some folk who say that I'm a dreamer 
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say 
For sure a body's bound to be a dreamer 
When all the the things he loves are far away. 

And precious things are dreams unto an exile 
They take him through a land across sea 
Especially when it happens he's in exile 
From that dear lovely Isle of Innisfree. 

And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops 
Of this great city, wondrous though it be 
I scarcely feel the beauty or the magic 
I'm once again back home in Inisfree. 

--- Instrumental --- 

I wander o'er green hills and dreamy valleys 
And find a peace no other land could know 
I hear the birds make music fit for angels 
And see the rivers laughing as they flow. 

And then into a humble shack I wander 
My own sweet home and tenderly behold 
The folks I love around the turf fire gathered 
On bended knees, their rosary is told. 

But dreams don't last though dreams are not forgotten 
When we are back to stern reality. 
And though they pave the footways here with gold dust 
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree. 

I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree...

Daniel O'Donnell,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
With people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
But there's gangs of them digging for gold in the street
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed
Well, if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball
Faith they don't wear a top to their dresses at all
Oh, I've seen them meself and you could not in trath
Say if they were bound for a ball or a bath
Don't be startin' them fashions now, Mary Macree
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

I've seen England's King from the top of a bus
I never knew him, though he means to know us
And tho' by the Saxon we once were oppressed
Still I cheered, God forgive me, I cheered with the rest
And now that he's visited Erin's green shore
We'll be much better friends than we've been heretofore
When we've got all we want we're as quiet as can be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

You remember young Peter O'Loughlin, of course
Well, now he is here at the head of the force
I met him today, I was crossing the Strand
And he stopped the whole street with wan wave of his hand
And there we stood talkin' of days that are gone
While the whole population of London looked on
But for all these great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here, oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
And lovely complexions all roses and cream
But O'Loughlin remarked with regard to the same
""That if at those roses you venture to sip
The colours might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea",The Mountains of Mourne
Daniel O'Donnell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died to take away my sin.

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.

You handed me your book
I signed this way:

Violets are blue. 
Sugar is sweet, my love.

I wrote into your book,
Next to my name: 

""Roses are red, my love. 
Violets are blue.

Across the ocean wild and wide

And tears bedim your loving eyes.

Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
Refrain:

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.

Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

Daniel O'Donnell,"Should you go first and I remain to walk the road alone
I'll live in memory's garden dear with happy days we've known
In spring I'll wait for roses red, when fades the lilacs bloom
And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

In that fair homeland, we'll know no parting
Beyond the sunset for ever more

Daniel O'Donnell,"It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Wishin' I'd never met her, knowing if I forget her
How much better off she would be

The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on
The harder that it's going to be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

I'd never desert her, God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries, but she can't tell how she feels
But I know, too well, just what she's going through

If I love her so much, I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her, ""This time it's all over""
Making two times I've told her goodbye
Last night, we broke up, this morning I woke up
And for the fifth time, I'm changing my mind

I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Daniel O'Donnell,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift
Daniel O'Donnell,"The lights of London, are far behind
The thoughts of homeland are crowding my mind
Familiar places, come in to view
I see my home now, soon I'll see you.

We'll talk to the old folk, they're getting on
Treat them to late nights, sing a few songs
We'll talk of the neighbors and life in the town
There's so much to tell them, the days fly around.

This is my homeland, the place I was born in
No matter where I go it's in my soul
My feet may wander a thousand places
But my heart will lead me back home to my Donegal.

And then tomorrow we'll take a walk
Down to St. Marys to a sheltered spot
We'll kneel and pray there for the ones that?re gone
And hope they're proud of, their wandering son.

I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz
The party's all over I came uninvited
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball


There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be
I guess i should know that someone used to be me
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names

Daniel O'Donnell,"When I was young and went to school
They taught me how to write
To take the chalk and make a mark
And hope it turns out right
Well that's the way it is with love
And what you did to me
I wrote it so you'd know
That I was yours eternally

[Chorus]
But my tears have washed I love you
From the blackboard of my heart
It's too late to clean the slate
And make another start
I'm satisfied the way things are
Although we're far apart
My tears have washed I love you from
The blackboard of my heart

If you'd been true the way you should
And not have gone astray
These tears would not have fallen down
And washed the words away
No need to talk, 'cause if the chalk
Should write those words again It will be for someone else
Not things that might have been

[Chorus]",Blackboard of My Heart
Daniel O'Donnell,"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealin'
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
The-en suddenly I got that old-time feelin'
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you (still in love with you)

And hold ya just the way I used to do

Daniel O'Donnell,"Sing me, sing me an old fashioned song
Bring me, back in my mind, to a time where my memories all come from
Ah good timing song, the kind that makes you want to sing along
A good old fashioned, hand clapping, knee slapping, foot tapping song

When I was young I used to wait
Upon my master and drain his pipe
And pass the bottle when his was dry
And wash away the boot tail fly

You have a right
Desira - desiderata

Go placidly amid the noise and haste, 
And remember what peace there may be, in silence.
As far as possible without surrender, 
Be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly, 
And listen to others, 
Even the dull and ignorant; 
They too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons, 
They are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others, 
You may become vane and bitter; 

For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. 

You are a child of the universe, 
No less than the trees and the stars; 
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, 
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, 
However humble; 
It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs; 
For the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; 
Many persons strive for high ideals; 
And everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love; 
For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
It is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the council of the years, 
Gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline; 
Be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe, 
No less than the trees and the stars; 
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you, 
No doubt the universe is unfolding; 
As it should.

Therefore be at peace with god, 
Whatever you conceive him to be, 
And whatever your labors and aspirations, 
In the noisy confusion of life, 
Keep peace with your soul.

With all it's sham, 
Drudgery and broken dreams, 
It is still a beautiful world.
Be careful. strive to be happy.

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
 
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Hear the sound of joy that it's singin'

She said 'I suppose you've heard about Alice.'
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
A big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive.

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know,
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice.

Carved our initials deep in the bark

We may never meet again.

Everybody on the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang

I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Way over in the corner weepin' all alone

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair""

To meet with old friends that are true

And nothing it seems stays the same
But the times that we share, that old feeling's still there

And may all of your fears disappear
May all of your problems be small ones
Till the next time we're all gathered here

We have in our lives every day
So until the next time I see you
Close to my heart you will stay

Tonight we have made some more memories
And nothing can take them away

As we travel life's journey each day
The road that takes us away will take us back here some day

Wonder off into space 
They laugh at your bad 
They take what they see 
But you are good enough for me 

So you run to the moon 
And you left us behind 
Was the world just too cruel
Were we just to unkind

I hope you remember 
I hope you are clear 
That you were good enough for me 
Yeah you were good enough for me 

You're learning how to fly away 
My beauty queen from yesterday 
And how's it feel to fall from grace 
'Cause I never had the chance to say 
That you were good enough, good enough for me 

If I can go back to the place 
There would time I must understood 
Even though it's complicated 
I can seem to overstate it, I think finally 
The moment should go 
Would you kiss me goodbye 

Wherever you go 
I hope you believe 
That you were good enough for me 
Yeah you were good enough for me 

I guess I wasn't very strong 
I should've told you I was wrong

Daniel Powter,"I don't know what I did but I must have been a fool
I got no excuses so I wrote this song for you
Whatever the reasons did you come to say goodbye?
I'm hoping for one more try, I wanted to change your mind

So I pick up the pieces, I swallowed all my pride
I don't wanna wake up, feeling this empty inside
Did it spin you around? Did it turn you upside down?
I wonder when you found out I'm a waste of your time

So don't give up on me
I never meant to steal your smile, I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
Just try to understand that I can be a better man

I tell you once just don't give up on me, yeah
I tell you once just don't give up on me

And now I feel that I'm out of place
I look for you on every stranger's face
I don't think I can do this any more

And every little things just falls apart
From the very first that day I broke your heart
It only makes me want you more and more just like before

'Cause you spin me around and now you turn me upside down
I never meant to be a waste of your time

So don't give up on me
I never meant to steal your smile, I haven't seen it for a while
And don't, don't give up on me
Just try to understand that I can be a better man

I tell you once just don't give up on me

You heading down to Mexico

Tell me do you still got the same bikini
That you wore in sixty-five
You know that one with the rose and the other [Incomprehensible]
The one that made me feel alive

If your daddy asks me where you are
What am I supposed to do?
Just tell him the whole world is passing me by
I ain't got nothing left to prove

And I'm gonna fly, fly, fly away
And if our love is strong we'll never go wrong
'Cause that's the place to be

Baby, bye, bye, bye, baby
And if you ever come down we'll still fool around
And watch the sunset to the sea

And as the little black bird sat on the roof
Where did my baby go?
You said sometimes life could thrown you off track
You're weary and you never know

If your daddy asks me where you are
What am I supposed to say?
You tell him the whole world is passing me by
I'm gonna live my life my own way

I'm gonna fly, fly, fly away
And if our love is strong we'll never go wrong

And baby, bye, bye, bye, baby
And if you ever come down we'll still fool around
And watch the sunset to the sea

You send the pictures of us dancing all night long?

So baby I fly, fly, fly away
And if our love is strong we'll never go wrong

And baby, bye, bye, bye, baby
And if you ever come down we'll still fool around

'Cause I don't feel too strong?

Was it something that I said, was it something that I did
Or the combination of both that did me in?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Even if it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought of finally being erased
But baby that's the best of me

Everything's behind you
But the hopeless signs besides you
I'm living in the moment
Have I wasted all your time?

Was it something that I said, was it something that I did
Or the combination of both that did me in?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Even if it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought finally being erased
But baby that's the best of me, yeah
Baby that's the best of me

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Even if it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do, you need a friend
Don't wanna be there when
There's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought of finally being erased
But baby that's the best of me",Best of Me

Reconozco mi error 
No quise aceptar que fué amor 
Y desde que te fuiste 
Ya no sé quien soy 
Y ya no sé vivir sin tu calor 
Como saber que me iba a lastimar 
Y es muy tarde ya para aceptar 

Que eres tú mi sentimiento 
Eres todo lo que siento 
Daría la vida por tenerte aquí 
Y entregar 
El amor que no te di 
Vive el recuerdo 
En mi corazón 
Tus besos tu manera de amar 
Me haces tanta falta 
Ya no aguanto más 
Como es que te he dejado escapar 
Yo nunca quise hacerte a ti llorar

Y hoy me mata estar sin ti

I'll lean on Him forever
And He'll forsake me never

He will not fail me
As long as my faith is strong
What ever road I may walk alone

I'll walk with God, I'll take His hand
I'll talk with God, He'll understand
I'll pray to Him, each day to Him
And He'll hear the words that I say

His hand will guide my throne and rod
And I'll never walk alone
While I walk with God

I don't want you to remember others
I am jealous at the thought 
that you may remember another person's love

Swear to me that even though mich time passes
I'll never forget the moment that I met you
Look at me there is nothing more profound
Nor grander in this world than my affection for you
Kiss me, with the kiss of a lover
Like no other's ever kissed me

Want me, want me until you are filled with madness
Then you will know the bitterness that I am suffering because fo you","Jurame, song"
Daniel Rodriguez,"So many nights I have stood in the moonlight
Watching it fade with the dawn
Wanting her back with me, warm in the moonlight
Knowing that moment was gone
Out of mind, out of sight,
Till the moon rose tonight
All at once, I felt a chill
In a spill of moonlight, she was there
Though we both held very still
There was something pulling in the air
When she whispered through the dark
I tried hard to hold my ground
I believed I had a choice
Till the music in her voice
Turned my whole world around
I would like to understand
But the stars and I begin to blur
If she never touched my hand
Then what filled me with the feel of her?

In between us stood a wall
In a flash it fell apart
Is it possible she heard
Every last unspoken word
Racing out of my heart?
She never turned to me, but suddenly
We had so much to share!
I never took her in my arms, but she was there
Oh, she was there!
No, I never pulled her in
Still her tenderness was everywhere
Oh, she slipped beneath my skin
Just as if she'd always been right there
Has she been there all along?
Was I too far gone to know?
What a fool I must have been
For how could I pull her in
When I've never let her go?",She Was There
Daniel Romano,"Well I was born in a small border town
And I left home at a young age and headed on down
And I started walking
Following a white line
I was on the side of a wild rush end freeway
With one pair of clothes and nothing else to my name
When a lorry would pass I would pick myself up with
A new coat of grit and a fresh layer of dust
I was dirty, fully covered
And just when the dirt started stinging my eyes
And I couldn’t decide the ground from the sky
A man pulled over and offered a ride
So I took it, I ran right over
And I got in his truck and sat perfectly still
And he said ‘I just gotta stop off at the mill’
I said ‘You can take me wherever you will’
And I asked him ‘What do they call you?’
And he answered ‘Chicken Bill, they call me Chicken Bill’

Well, on account of the dirt he thought I was a man
And he reached out his mint and he shook my filthy hand
He said ‘Boy, I got me a farm ‘round the bend
And I could sure use the help if you got time to land,
Catching chickens, chopping their head off, locking them up’
All right, run around
So I worked for old Bill and his beautiful wife
Who would cook up a chicken for us every night
And just when I thought everything was alright
He sat me down, he said ‘I’m skipping town,
Going …around’
And I said ‘How could you live such a woman behind?’
Then the look on his face helped me open my eyes
And for the first time I saw Chicken Bill’s other side
He sat down beside me, all nervous and shy
And he told me the real story of Chicken Bill",Chicken Bill

Thought I'd surprise you with some flowers

And knocked at your front door
And I heard the creek of footsteps

So I crept up to the window
I looked in and there I saw

And please sell my ring
To the pawnshop on the corner
Spend the money
On a love that you can stand

Or you could find a place
Where it never can be traced
It can’t see the light or day
Or get in anybody’s way
So please put my heart 
Where no one else will find it
I got no use for it 
Now that you’re gone

And please tell the sun
Not to shine over my shoulder
I don’t wanna see the light
If it isn’t in your eyes
And please tell the rain
It can pour on me forever
And cover up all the tears that I’ve cried

If you ever change your mind
And try me one more time
There’ll be nothing left of me
But a faded memory
So please put my heart
Where no one else will find it
Not even you, or the love we once knew",Where No One Else Will Find It

Living on your knees

Another silent hour, another golden mile
Another silent hour, another golden mile
Another empty heart, another bitter smile
Another silent hour, another golden mile

No fight, there's no crushing defeat
It's a lie run free
Those lies, they're precious to me
Come along, leave me be

For a silent hour, for a golden mile

There is bliss in this mess
There is madness all around

The stars hang in a shroud
And those whispers turn to shouts

Daniela Lujan,"Ven que yo te quiero platicar
Lo que me pasa a mí y a mi corazón
Desde ayer que lo vi

Es como una nueva sensación
Que llevo dentro de mí
Y creo que se llama amor

Cuéntame como ocurrió
Que yo también te quiero platicar
Que me pasa a mí y a mi corazón
Yo tengo esa misma sensación
Dentro de mi piel

Es amor

Él es alguien muy especial
Cuando lo veo pasar
Siento las piernas temblar

Es el hombre que siempre soñé
Siento peligro en mi piel
Cada que lo vuelvo a ver

Yo no encuentro la solución
Siento perder la razón
Muero por su corazón

Mi miente puede estallar
Si pienso en él un día más
Cómo decir la verdad

Tú eres en quien yo puedo confiar
Dime qué hacer, cómo hacerle ver
Que soy yo quein escribe

Páginas de amor
Que hablan de él
Con mucha ilusión
¿Qué debo hacer?

Tú eres en quein puedo yo confiar
Sabrás guardar
Esta confesión de amor

Los dos sentimos algo igual
El amor no es cuestión de edad
Creo que

Es un chavo muy especial
Me encanta su caminar
Y hasta su forma de hablar

",Es Amor
Daniela Lujan,"Cómo decirle
Lo que yo siento por él
Todo es confuso, qué hacer

Y ahora si yo me equivoco
Cómo podría yo hacer
Porque yo le amo y no sé

Siento sus besos
Y siento yo su suave piel
Abro los ojos, no está

Y es que lo sueño
Lo pienso y no podría asegurar
Que él también piensa igual

Abraza mi alma
Y habla con mi cuerpo
Y dame tu amor en mi interior

Siento que eres ya parte
De mi vida, te doy lo que soy
Porque tú eres yo

Eres mi amor, eres tú mi vida
Y mi pasión, tienes todo
Mi amor y mi corazón
Mira, te entrego mi amor

",Tema de Natalia
Daniela Lujan,"Vengan que les voy a explicar
Como es que deben bailar
Les va a gustar, les puedo yo apostar
Voy a empezar, vengan pa' ca

Este ritmo va a contagiar
A quien lo llegue a escuchar
Y cuiden sus pies, se pueden enredar
Hey, atención, voy a empezar

Las manos arriba a mover a mover
Girar la cadera al derecho y al revés
Abajo de una vez brincando 1, 2, 3
Abajo de una vez brincando 1, 2, 3
Arriba otra vez brincando 1, 2, 3

Van a tener que aguantar
Y además tendrás que repetir

Como el viento, como aves

Porque somos tan libres
Construyendo ilusiones
Que nos lleven tan lejos
A mundos muy poco reales

Siempre vuela alto
Oye no lo pienses tanto
Sueña lo que quieras
Una sirena en un desierto

Busca tus ideales
Hasta hacerlos reales

Tan grande como tú

Mandar cartas de amor

Y no hay contestación de ti
No quiero, no, no, no quiero
No quiero, no, no, no, no quiero

Parezco u saltimbanqui ni la amuelas
Salto, salto en toda dirección

Y si me paro yo, a su lado que le diré

En esa fiesta lo vi y yo empecé
A sentir como es que mi corazón palpitaba
El chavo tan especial me lanza con su mirar
Por fin creo que lo logre y viene hacia mí

Me dijo que guapa estas vamos te invito
A bailar que extraño que yo no te había visto
Bailemos le conteste que guapo estas
Tu también en realidad solo estaba esperándote

En esa fiesta lo vi y yo empecé
A sentir como es que mi corazón palpitar
El chavo tan especial me lanza con tu mirar
Que hice yo para conseguirlo

Son 5 vueltas las que ronde y ni volteo

E as últimas palavras desse nosso amor, você vai ter que ouvir
Me perdi de tanto amor, ah, eu enlouqueci
Ninguém podia amar assim e eu amei
E devo confessar, aí foi que eu errei
Vou te olhar mais uma vez, na hora de dizer adeus
Vou chorar mais uma vez quando olhar nos olhos seus, nos olhos seus

Daniela Mercury,"Juro que não vai doer
Se um dia eu roubar
O seu anel de brilhantes
Afinal de contas dei meu coração
E você pôs na estante

Como um troféu
No meio da buginganga
Você me deixou de tanga
Ai de mim que sou romântica!

Quando eu me sinto um pouco rejeitada
Me dá um nó na garganta
Choro até secar a alma de toda mágoa
Depois eu passo pra outra

Como mutante
No fundo sempre sozinho
Seguindo o meu caminho
Ai de mim que sou romântica!

Kiss me, baby, kiss me

Pena que você não me kiss
Não me suicidei por um triz
Ai de mim que sou assim!
(Romântica)

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

Hay un lenguaje nuevo que te acaricia dentro
Un hiño una mirada, un universo interno
Cuando empieza un amor no existen las quimeras
Una presencia llena, por fin llenar tus horas

Cuando empieza un amor un beso te hace fuerte
Y lo que te apasiona, es un detalle simple
Se usa mas lo nuestro, que de si tuyo o mio y todo es compartirlo
Con un alma sincera, corren por tus venas las sensaciones bellas
Y ese calor extraño te deja ver muy claro

Y no puedes dudarlo, la vida es infinita

Al lado de quien quiero
Mirándole sin ver
Oyendo sin oírlo
Dejando que los cuerpos
Piel a piel
Apaguen los sentidos
Con el mas delicioso licor
Que pueda existir bajo el sol
Somos tal para cual
Coincidencia genial
Casualidad.

Veneno para dos
Cóctel de amor
Que pone al rojo vivo
El corazón
En pleno desayuno
En un hotel de lujo
Enamorándonos

Veneno para dos
Fuego interior
Pasito a paso consumiéndonos
Tu pecho con el mio
Un único latido
En adelante cómplices.

Amanecer así, como en el
Mismo cielo
Sabiendo que te tengo junto a mi
Después de tanto tiempo
Justifica el insomnio de un mes
Indecisa entre tu y él
Menos mal que al final
Somos tal para cual
Y todo va.",Veneno Para Dos
Daniela Romo,"Que frió te he sentido esta noche,
Ya no hay palabras dulces al oído,
Te fuiste sin besar mis labios al adiós.

Y cuando te has marchado
Yo lo estuve pensando
Lo que se llama amor se termino
Y la pasión es clara
Pero no deja nada
Me hace solo sentir un gran dolor.

Sera que la nostalgia nos tiene confundidos
Nos lleva a buscarnos nuevamente.

Amantes
Ya no somos amantes
Lo siento esto es el final,
No existe la ternura
Ya se acabo la lucha
Tu y yo no somos mas

Amantes
Ya no somos amantes
No hay duda
Esto ya se rompió
Sera que la nostalgia
Nos llama en la distancia
Mas no seremos ya
Amantes.

Existe un gran cariño
Pero ya no es lo mismo
Y para rescatarlo
Es tarde ya
Nada rompe el silencio
Y hasta nos aburrimos
No hay alegría, ni fuerza de continuar

No hay sensaciones nuevas
Nuestra luz ya se ha apagado
Y las caricias llegan por costumbre.

En la almohada en que me duermo.

Que tomas el amor como de juego
Pero tu no te quisiste dar
Por miedo a enamorarte
De ser un loco amante.

Duele saber que no hay amor que te supere
Que araño las paredes de sentir
Que en otro cuerpo puedas ser feliz,
Me matan los celos.

Duele tenerte que admitir tal como eres
Si todos tus defectos defendí
Yo se que ya no puedo retenerte
Que tengo que ser fuerte,

Retando a mi destino,que me espera?
Errantes pasos siempre vida nueva.

Mis sentimientos son,como monedas,
Con ellas compro y vendo,lo que sea
Y el desengaño a veces es un precio.

Me guio por intuición y algunas veces por si acaso
Supersticiosamente busco piel,
Y si al tocarla existe la energía que me aviva,
Me entrego totalmente porque soy

Gitana.
Deliberadamente creo en la gente,
Quiero trazar caminos y llegar,

Dime que estas pensando solo en mi
En ese dulce abrazo de enamorados
Nunca mas extraños

Sueño que no haya sido una aventura
Solo primavera.

La luna fue testigo y el mar abrigo de arena y sal
Y me perdí en tus ojos mirando en ellos al sol brillar
Nunca imagine una pasión total
Nunca sospeche sentirme tan amada un día
Tan solo smog y hastío pienso en ti
Y es que me estoy sintiendo enamorada
De tus locos besos
Siento que estas pensando solo en mi
Que para ti no ha sido una aventura
Algo pasajero.

Daniela Romo,"Voy viviendo ya de tus mentiras

O yo que se  
Enamorarme así de ti  
Eso era un misterior

Me han colmado al fin  
La emoción  
La ternura y la pasión

Esplendente y feliz  
Nunca sospeche quererte así

Te quiero amar 
Como nadie te amo 
Quiero ser tu constante  
Tu locura tu amor  
Quiero vaciarme en ti  
Encender tu ilusión 
Ser recuerdo de ti  
Es comprender que existí  
Sin temerle al dolor  
Ser tu destino mayor 
Quiero ser tu alegría  
Tu poesía y tu voz  

Que gran delirio  
Va poblando mi razón  
Con solo un beso  
Me has abierto el corazón  

(te quiero amar como nadie te amo ser tu constante tu locura tu amor)
Quiero vaciarme en ti
Encender tu ilusión

Tu planeta tu flor
Brillar para ti.","Atarte a Mi, Corazn"
Daniela Romo,"El tren de medianoche se ha marchado
Y bien sabia que no ibas a volver
Por ti me había peleado con la vida
Soñando un paraíso que no fue.

Y ahora tengo que afrontar
Que esto termino
Se que soy tan ajena a estar sin ti
Y no me puedo desatar pierdo identidad
Esperar tu ternura fue mi osadía.

Me tengo que enfrentar a vivir sola
Y tengo que aprender a estar en mi
Aun sabiendo que me destruía
Me encuentro presa de mi libertad.

Y ahora no seas inmadura
Me repito a diario
Aceptarme y curarme
Es mi aventura
Y ahora la confianza en mi es la vía segura
Es un soplo de viento
Esta aventura.

Hoy un ave fénix debo ser
Batir mis alas fuerte
Con todas mis ganas renacer.

Aprenderé a querer
Lo que soy lo que seré
Vivir es una hazaña

Que proeza que gran aventura.",Ave Fénix
Daniela Romo,"El ayer tan solo es
Un testamento anticuado

Por hoy

Con pasión y con amor  

Sin temor abrazate

Daniela Romo,"Yo pensé que podría, olvidarte algún día, y no es verdad
Porque el tiempo, no borra ni llena el vació
Desde que no estas.

Se desgarra mi alma, tu recuerdo me clava
Como un puñal
Se agiganta el anelo, la ansiedad y el deseo
De volverte a encontrar.

Las heridas no, no sanan en un día no
Se quedan en la mente si, dentro de ti por siempre
Las heridas no, no cierran simplemente no
Se abren de repente si, cuando el amor termina.

Tu mirada, tus besos, tus locuras, tus celos,
Donde estarán
Me atormento pensando, que tal vez otros brazos
Te abrigaran.

Cada vez que amanece, tu recuerdo aparece en mi
Soledad
Y te lloro en silencio, y es en vano el lamento
Porque es tarde ya.

Las heridas no, no sanan en un día no
Se quedan en la mente si, dentro de ti por siempre

Se abren de repente si, cuando el amor termina.

Soportar tu cruel ausencia,
Caminar ya sin ti

Soledad sin fin, un espacio donde tú no estas
Los recuerdos que repaso en mí no me dejan ni soñar
Soledad sin fin el perfume que ha quedado aquí
Un dolor insoportable que va secando poco a poco lo que fui

Como me haces falta ya me siento enferma
Y mis pobres labios besan tan solo sal de lágrimas
Yo soy como una sombra que se esfuma en las paredes
Un mar sin espuma, ya no responde nada en mí

Donde ir como saber si el vació reina aquí
Soportar tu cruel ausencia, existir ya sin ti

Soledad sin fin un espacio donde tú no estas
La distancia que hay entre tú y yo
Un abismo sin cruzar
Soledad sin fin y el perfume que ha quedado aquí

Creo que es mejor que sin rencor decidas irte.
Es por demás, no me das más, siempre me dices no
Y la verdad es que jamás me dices ""te amo yo""
Tan solo yo siempre te doy lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más y eso es ingratitud
Y te tengo que esperar hasta el amanecer
Y todo porque te amo, nada más

Pero no puedo más, se que me cansaré
Es mucho, y es que abusas tu de más.

Es tonto amor si piensas tú que tengo que aguantar
Ya decidí que yo me voy si es que tu no te vas
Es tiempo de que yo también me vaya a divertir
Tengo con qué, busco con quién
Ya quiero sonreír

Tan solo yo siempre te doy lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más y eso es ingratitud
Y te tengo que esperar hasta el amanecer
Y todo porque te amo, nada más

Pero es por demás, no, no puedo más,

Sonríes sin saber por que, suspiras , suspiras
La gente habla alrededor

Le digo que lo pensaré.

El timbre del teléfono que llama, le llama
Le digo que ya lo pensé

Y yo que me encontraba sola y triste hoy
Y el que me miraba sin parar
Le dije que el amor es algo para dos
Y ahora no recuerdo mas.

Daniela Romo,"Ayer la soledad me hablaba
Pensé si nuestro amor se acaba
Silencios en donde había palabras
Dos sombras que no se mezclan nunca.
Ayer la soledad que me rondaba
Me hablo de libertad robada
Costumbres que se van desgastando
Siluetas que el tiempo va borrando

Que tonta soy que tonta soy,
Mira lo que pude pensar
Sera porque sera porque
Te necesito mas, y tu me quieres mas o no
Ayer la soledad me acompañaba
Pensé con una gran melancolía
En la pasión que nos quemara un día
En ese gran amor que se volvió ternura

Para mi circulación 
Pero no es justo tan solo tus ojos 
Mueven esta sensación 
Dime que es cierto que eres sincero 
O esta noche yo aprendo y te digo no 

Bastara con dejarme volar y perderme en tu cielo 
Bastara si me dejas amar y habitar en tu cuerpo

Bastara que me digas que si que me dejes sentir  dime 

Al oído que solo eres mio y nunca yo te perderé  
Grita conmigo yo te necesito  
Y siempre te defenderé  dime que es cierto  que eres sincero

Daniela Romo,"Es la nostalgia

Un tenue velo

Rumor de pasos, 
El eco de un violín. 

Pero el silencio es al cabo 
Quien me dará su verdad, 
Y en tanto la vida gira. 

Es la nostalgia 
Un valsecito gris, 
Un vano intento 
De volver a vivir.

Ciego,paisajes que ya no están, 
Y como el ayer no vuelve más.

Dios de octubre, Dios de primavera, 
Dios de esperanza, Dios de fe, 
Sólo visible a nuestros ojos.

Hasta que me lleve con él 
Fuera de la vida.

Le entrego mis hojas secas, 
Mis frustraciones, mis orgullos, 
Todos mis sueños.

Mi amor por la cocina, 
Los mejores vinos,mis segundos de paz, 
Mis angustias cotidianas. 

Le entrego todas mis pasiones, 
Mi guitarra, mi infancia, 
Los frutos de mi cuerpo. 

Mis nueces, mis etapas, 
Mis caminos perdidos, 
Todo lo que florezca en mi alma. 

Le entrego mis ojos tristes, 
Mi mejor sonrisa, 
Mi casa junto al mar, 
Mi cabaña en el bosque 
Llena de amor.

Mi condición de sol.
 
Sólo me guardo para mí

Sin fatalismos, 
Que más pudiera yo pedir

Lleno de odios.

De donde viene el dolor. 
Porque todo fluya y coincida

Soy un alma, hoy respiro, 
Soy libre, lo agradezco,

Daniele Silvestri,"C'è, in un'isola lontana, una favola cubana
Che vorrei tu conoscessi almeno un po'
C'è un'ipotesi migliore, per cui battersi e morire
E non credere a chi dice di no
Perché c'è

C'è un profumo inebriante che dall'Africa alle Ande
Ti racconta di tabacco e caffè

C'è una voce chiara ed argentina, che fu fuoco e medicina
Come adesso è amore e rabbia per me

C'è, tra le nuvole di un sigaro, la voce di uno zingaro
Che un giorno di gennaio gridò

C'è, o almeno credo ci sia stato, un fedelissimo soldato
Che per sempre quella voce cercò

E che diceva

Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte
Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte

C'è, se vai ben oltre l'apparenza, un'impossibile coerenza
Che vorrei tu ricordassi almeno un po'

C'è una storia che oramai è leggenda, e che potrà sembrarti finta
E invece è l'unica certezza che ho

C'erano dei porci in una baia, armi contro la miseria
Solo che quel giorno il vento cambiò

C'era un uomo troppo spesso solo, e ora resta solo un viso
Che milioni di bandiere giudò

E che diceva

Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte
Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte

L'america ci guarda
Non proprio con affetto
Apparentemente placida ci osserva

Ma in fondo, lo sospetto
Che l'america, l'america ha paura
Altrimenti non si spiega come faccia
A vedere in uno stato in miniatura
Questa orribile minaccia

Di una bocca appena aperta di un respiro senza fiato

Ho paura di sfiorarti e rovinare tutto 
No, tu dormi ancora un po' ancora non so 
Guardarti anch'io nel modo giusto 
Nei tuoi occhi disarmanti 

Sono occhi di ambra lucida tra palpebre di viole 
Sguardo limpido d'aprile come quando esce il sole 
Ed io sarò la nuvola che ti terrà nascosta 
Perché gli altri non si accorgano di averti persa 

Ma tu dormi ancora un po' non svegliarti ancora no 
Ho paura di sfiorarti e rovinare tutto 
No, tu dormi ancora un po' ancora non so 
Guardarti anch'io nel modo giusto

Quei tuoi occhi che ho davanti 
Tienili chiusi ancora pochi istanti

Che m'hanno preso l'anima

Mi puoi fa' cambia' opinione

È solo l'abbaglio di chi da dietro spera
Che tu ci provi ancora
Perchè poi gira e rigira gli serve solo una scusa

La fregatura è che c'è sempre un altro che paga
E c'è qualcuno che indaga per estirpare la piaga
Però chissà come mai qualsiasi cosa accada
Nel palazzo lontano nessuno fa una piega

Daniele Silvestri,"Mi sono innamorato di una stronza
Ci vuole una pazienza
Io però ne son rimasto senza
Era molto meglio pure una credenza
Un fritto di paranza, paranza, paranza

La paranza è una danza
Che ebbe origine sull'isola di Ponza
Dove senza concorrenza
Seppe imporsi a tutta la cittadinanza
È una danza
Ma si pensa
Rappresenti l'abbandono di una stronza
Dal calvario alla partenza
Fino al grido conclusivo di esultanza

Uomini uomini c'è ancora una speranza
Prima che un gesto vi rovini l'esistenza
Prima che un giudice vi chiami per l'udienza
Vi suggerisco un cambio di residenza
E poi ci vuole solo un poco di pazienza
Qualche mese e già nessuno nota più l'assenza
La panacea di tutti i mali è la distanza
E poi ci si consola con la paranza

La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
Così da Genova puoi scendere a Cosenza
Come da Brindisi salire su in Brianza
Uno di Cogne andrà a Taormina in prima istanza
Uno di Trapani? Forse in Provenza
No, no, no, non è possibile
Non è raccomandabile
Fare ritorno al luogo originario di partenza
Ci sono regole precise in latitanza
E per resistere c'è la paranza

La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
Dimmi che mi ami, che mi ami
E quando ti allontani
Per prima cosa mi richiami
In ogni caso è molto meglio se rimani
Se rimandi a domani
Dimmi che ci tieni, che ci tieni
E se non vieni
In ogni caso mi appartieni
E che ti manco più dell'aria che respiri
Più di prima
Più di ieri

Dov'è, dov'è
Tutti si chiedono
Dov'è dov'è
Ma non mi trovano
Lo sai che c'è?
Che sto benissimo
Fintanto che
Sto a piede libero
E poi perché
Ritornare da lei
Quando per lei è sempre stato meglio senza di me
Non riusciranno a prendermi
Io resto qui

La paranza es un baile
Que se baila con la latitanza
Con prudencia y elegancia
Y con un lento movimiento de panza
E se io latito, latito
Mica faccio un illecito
Se non sai dove abito
Se non entro nel merito
Se non vado a discapito
Dei miei stessi consimili
Siamo uomini liberi
Siamo uomini liberi
Stiamo comodi comodi
Sulle stuoie di vimini
Sulle spiagge di Rimini
Sull'atollo di Bimini
Latitiamo da anni
Con i soliti inganni
Ma non latiti tanto quando capiti a pranzo
E se io latito latito
Mica faccio un illecito
Se non sai dove abito
Se non entro nel merito
Se non vado a discapito

Daniele Silvestri,"Visto dall’oblò di questo aereo
Il mondo sembra ben organizzato
Dell’uomo cogli l’operato serio
Il tratto netto, duro ed ordinato
Reticoli di campi cesellati
Di cui non percepisci mai l’arsura
E specchi d’acqua poi, come diamanti
Che l’uomo ha regalato alla natura
Forse per darle una struttura
Per darle una struttura
Le strade che si inseguono impossibili
Dei popoli raccontano il cammino
Aggirano i più straordinari ostacoli
O basta non guardarle da vicino 

E noi che siamo in mezzo a queste ali impavide
Non siamo niente o siamo tutto
Lasciarci trasportare è stato facile
Ma adesso ritornare giù non sembrerebbe giusto 
Dovremmo resistere
Dovremmo insistere
E starcene ancora su
Se fosse possibile
Toccando le nuvole
O vivere altissimi
Come due acrobati
Sospesi

Non guardare giù, non so se c’è la rete
Il mondo da quassù sembra lontano e invece
Invece è un attimo e lo sai
Rifinirci dentro
E devo stare attento
A non sbagliare ancora
A non sbagliare
A non sbagliare

E c’è una strada sottilissima
Che non riesco più a vedere
Se continui ad aggrapparti rischiamo di cadere
Di cadere oppure fingere un’altra acrobazia
Questione di equilibrio
L’equilibrio è una filosofia
Dovremmo resistere
Dovremmo insistere
E starcene ancora sù
Se fosse possibile
Toccando le nuvole
O vivere altissimi
Come due acrobati
Sospesi

Il tempo
Non passa
Rallenta
Si ferma
È il vento
Che conta
Che canta

Disobbedire alla gravità
Non credo che sia grave
Non credo che sia grave
Non puoi chiamarla libertà
Finchè non rischi di cadere
Non rischi di cadere
Dall’alto
C’è sempre qualcuno che guarda
Guarda",Acrobati
Daniele Silvestri,"Non era vero (non era vero)
Che era finito
Ho preso al volo
Il tuo rifiuto
Gli ho dato un peso (non era vero)
L'ho valutato

Poi l'ho sospeso
Come adesso il fiato
Perché alla fine si può non dire
Si può mentire
A fin di bene
È il senso diuna foto 
Indviduale
Un solo istante 
Da congelare

E tutto ciò che viene dopo
Non è avvenuto
Si può cambiare

Da lì in poi
Da qui in poi

Dall'alto
C'è sempre
Qualcuno
Che guarda

Daniele Silvestri,"Escono tutte le sere 
Per essere certi 
Di non ritrovarsi a rimpiangere niente 
Si riempiono gli occhi
Le mani ed il ventre
Di occhi, di mani e di malto
Poi vanno all'assalto di un altro locale
Di un'altra avventura e di un altro bicchiere
In cui sciogliere un altro frammento di vita e poi bere

Rientrano tutte le notti
Ogni volta più sfatti
Dei loro misfatti ricordano niente
La luce del giorno gli azzera la mente
La luce di un giorno qualunque
Per loro comunque si tratta di ore
Da vivere in fretta
O da fare passare
Che la sera è vicina e qualcosa bisognerà fare
Con un altro bicchiere

Non ricordo bene se ci siamo visti prima
Ma tu riempimi il bicchiere
Che fra poco la mattina arriverà

This is just another glass
Not a brokenhearted mess
And I love to watch you rolling all alone
It's just the best
This is just another day
Friends have other games to play
And I love to let it turn and turn and turn
And make it last
(Just another glass)
Just another glass
Just another glass
Just another glass
Just another glass
Just another glass

Rischiano tutte le sere
Di essere persi
E di non ritrovarsi ad avere più niente
Per loro il futuro è un pensiero distante
O comunque un pensiero distratto
La vita è in quel piatto di cose salate
Che bruciano l'anima e mettono sete
Sì, ma allora prendetevi un altro bicchiere e bevete
Alla vostra salute
E continuano a bere
E continuano a bere",Un altro bicchiere

Ma eri già ad alta quota

Piene di persone sole

Sale la tensione se si sente male il commensale
Se ci sono le persone allora usale, usale

Vedo ancora processare
Le streghe di salem
La mia rabbia non si può inabissare
Come ingoiare sale e curry
Vedi che risale
Sulla trota versiamo sempre un pacco di sale sano
E se accecato domani vi giuro sale sano

Come nel deserto
Ramsete
Brindiamo finchè ribaltiamo l'asse cartesiano

Sulla salaria, sulla salaria

Facciamo a piedi le strade
Come cambia la marcia del sale
Da quando esistono le saliere
Sono diventati tutti agitatori
Io voglio volare con le canzoni
Non mettere salieri sulla coda 
Delle fazioni

Con tutto il sale che ho sulla coda divento
Caustico come la soda
Col poco sale che ho nella capa
Non ci condisco le cime di rapa
Sono di sale le statue che vedi
Talmente basali che dormono in piedi
Ma i sali che perdi sudando stasera
Posso trovarli scavando in miniera

Risale di versi
E non porta male
Come il sale che versi
I versi del sale
Non tergiversare
Papille gustative
Trasalite, trasalire, trasaline
Lo senti che sale
Lo senti che siaamo nell'avanguardia
Siamo nell'ipertesto senza la seconda T
(Ma secondo chi?) 
Può andar bene a seconda di

Chi sale sul traliccio per difendere il salario
Sa legittimare il gesto
Come un cristo nel sudario
Sale lentamente ma sale costantemente la pressione, sale
Quella fiscale
Quella che fa male di sicuro
Ti sale un odio che altro che sodio col suo cloruro
E giuro che se il mio intervento è ancora troppo sciapo
Non c'è alcun problema
L'ho già fatto
E lo farò da capo

E salerò (il sale di versi)
Salerò (e non portano male
E salerò (i versi del sale, non tergiversare)
E salerò (non puoi venire a dirmi che non è possibile)
E salerò
E salerò (in alto le bandiere del sale, il sale, il sale)
Si sa che non tutti i mali vengano per nuocere
Non tutti i sali vengono per cuocere

Se metti i soldi in tasca te li levano

Daniele Silvestri,"La mia casa è a Lisbona
A metà di una collina
Dove l’aria è sempre buona
In una piccola stradina che si inerpica
Guidata da rotaie
Che spariscono a ogni curva
E resistono alla furba ammaliazione del progresso
Che qui tanto non disturba neanche adesso
Questione di contesto e di cultura
La mia casa è una finestra in miniatura
E dopo i tetti in lontananza, il mare aperto

La mia casa è Marrakech
In quella piazza sgangherata
Così bella da sembrare una pittura
Così forte da restarti appiccicata
Pure essendo totalmente priva di un'architettura
E questa cosa nessuno mai l’ha spiegata
Che quella piazza lì non è fatta di niente
Solo di polvere e di musica, e di gente colorata
Casa mia è là, e c’è sempre stata

La mia casa è in un ostello di Berlino
Chiaramente riadattato come tutto
In questo splendido casino organizzato
Dove niente è come sembra
O perlomeno niente è più com’era stato
E tutto quanto intorno me lo insegna
Che il passato che è già stato fatto a pezzi come un muro
Qualcosa ne è rimasto per orgoglio tutto il resto invece
È proiettato nel futuro
Se poi verrà il momento in cui ci vuole il sole
E un vento che ti chiama
Casa mia sarà una cava a Favignana
Tra due ali di farfalla
Una bianca come il tufo e dolce
Quasi come l’altra è dura e gialla

La mia casa è a Camden Town
Nella Londra dei canali
Dei mercati sempre pieni
Degli inglesi sempre strani
Dei vinili che nascondono tesori mai sentiti
La mia casa allora affaccia sul Tamigi
E forse è molto più lontana e in cima agli scalini di (?)
Forse casa mia è a Parigi
Tra la bastiglia e il Bataclan
Sì, casa mia è a Parigi
Tra la Bastiglia e Notre-Dame

Perché ho amato mille volte
E mille volte ho cominciato
E ho lasciato mille pezzi del mio cuore
Sul sagrato delle chiese
Nel cortile abbandonato di un compound sud sudanese
Sul tortuoso muro a secco gallurese
Su di un ponte chilometrico di Istanbul, magnifica e geniale
Che riesce a trasformare il mare in fiume e viceversa
Il fiume in mare

Nella mia casa è tutta Roma
Perché è qui che sono nato
In mezzo ai preti, i gladiatori, gli avvocati, i senatori
I tassinari, gli impiegati, le bariste, gli artigiani
I rigattieri, i poliziotti, i cravattari, le puttane
E le duemila fontanelle per le strade
Dove l’acqua scorre sempre e non si ferma
Come se l’acqua fosse Roma
Come se fosse eterna
Come se l’acqua fosse Roma
Come se fosse eterna",La mia casa

Vivo giorni sempre uguali riavvolgendo il film
Poche cose ma fondamentali
E ad orari che scandisco sempre identici

Prevedibile come un giornale
Ma letale e inamovibile come un marine
E mi piacciono le cose nuove
Ma soltanto tra le undici e le dodici di mercoledì

Che se lo riguardo adesso
Mi si spezza il cuore
Mi si spezza il cuore
Mi si spezza
Il cuore

Il dolore
E mia madre
Mia madre e il dolore
Sempre insieme
Non riesco neanche ad immaginarli
Come due cose distinte
Che se almeno una volta
Avesse chiesto il mio aiuto
Poi magari riuscivo a chiederglielo anch’io
E invece no
Avanti col suo fardello
Che bello

E mio fratello
Mio fratello
Che gliene importa a mio fratello
Non sa nemmeno dove sto
A lui basta la sua vita
Il suo lavoro
Il suo sport
La sua chitarra
Mi dice nella vita
Si chiude una porta
E se ne apre un’altra
Sì, magari, io mi ricordo solo porte chiuse
Forse è per questo che vivo in ventiquattro metri quasri
E di porte qui non ce n’è nemmeno una
Nemmeno una
Anzi si, una c’è, quella per entrare
Ma io non la uso per entrare
La uso per chiudermi dentro
E sono bravissima a chiudermi dentro
È una vita che mi chiudo dentro

C’è una finestra però
Non si vede un granchè
Però adesso potrei aprire quella finestra
E volare

E volare

Era lì con una pistola
Usala, usala, ora
È quello sì, è quello che lei spera
Spera ma non spara ancora",Monolocale
Daniele Silvestri,"Mio padre aveva un orologio
Senza nessuna peculiarità
Eppure quando lo guardava mi sembrava che il mondo fosse più sicuro

Mio padre aveva un suo equilibrio
Un tipo magro di una certa età
Eppure quando mi stringeva a se sembrava che ci fosse niente di più vero
Niente di più duraturo

E poi mi sono laureato
Una buona facoltà
Faccio credo l'avvocato
Di una qualche società
E tutto quello che ho imparato
Non mi serve a molto qua
Anche il tempo mi è sfuggito
E non so più dove sta

E poi c'è il cane del vicino
Che quando inizia poi finisce più
È vero sono stato io, lo so, ho sbagliato, ma il mondo adesso è più sereno

E poi mi sono fidanzato
Con l'attuale mia metà
Che per due volte mi ha lasciato
Ma è ancora qua
E quando sono disperato
Io ripenso al mio Papà
E all'orologio che ho perduto, non so che ore fa
Che ore fa",L' orologio
Daniele Silvestri,"Se avessi un altro modo per fermare i tuoi pensieri
Giuro lo userei
E invece riesco solo a non guardarti in quei tuoi occhi seri
Perché mi perderei

È stupido sapere esattamente cosa dire
E non dirlo mai
Guardarti mentre pieghi i tuoi vestiti prima di partire
E non sapere se ritornerai
Se ritornerai

Eppure c'era stato un tempo
Me lo ricordo solo io
In cui niente rimaneva dentro
E il tuo pensiero era il mio
Lo so è passato tanto
Un milione di milioni di anni fa
Quando tutto era, era tutto
Mentre adesso è la metà
La metà
La metà, sì
La metà",Pensieri

Però mi manchi da morire
Non te lo dirò mai ma fino a che non torni
Io rischio di impazzire

E se non te lo scrivo adesso in un messaggio
Magari con più stile
È solo per non dartelo questo vantaggio
E per non essere, per non essere puerile

Non so se ti sei accorta che iniziava Maggio 
Intanto terminava Aprile
Terminava Aprile, terminava Aprile

Che invece dici che ti fidi di me
E che vorresti ci fidassimo
Ma è qui che casca l'asino

Però non preoccuparti, dai, che mi farò coraggio
Domani provo a uscire
Non voglio certamente rovinarti questo viaggio che però
Dovrà finire prima o poi
Dovrà finire e non finisce mai
Dovrà finire e non finisce mai
Non torni mai, tu non ritorni mai
Non torni mai, cosa cazzo fai

È il minimo che se dipendeva da me
Manco per sogno rimanevo solo senza di te
Infatti rosico
Come un facocero
Mi irrito perché chiedi poco di me
Che invece fingo e minimizzo con te
Che mi confondi con un monaco
Ma mica basta, l'abito

Ma sono solo pochi giorni
Sono solo pochi giorni, solo

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee,

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite,

I've been afraid of being broken
I've laid it all out on the line, but
Never like this

I found myself in a situation
No walls, no reservations
Diving in deep, no hesitations
It's taking too time and I'm tired of waiting

oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh)

Danielle Bradbery,"We had a plan to get out of town and keep headin' east
Til we could see that moon sink into the Carolina beach
I snuck out at ten o'clock, you were waitin' a couple blocks
Away in your car between your house and mine
We held hands and drove too fast
Took five hours and a tank of gas
But now we're here and all alone
I know we'll be dead when we get home, but

[Chorus]
Talk about stars
Talk about hearts
Beatin' like the waves on the shoreline
Two names written in the sand
A long kiss and a slow dance
Talk about young
Talk about fun
Craziest thing we've ever done
Two kids caught up in this rush
Talk about love

Let's kick off our shoes, and run down to
That boardwalk
Jump that gate, hope and pray
We don't get caught
Can you believe we're finally here
Bare feet hangin' off the pier
I thought I'd seen it all tonight
But then you put your lips on mine, and

[Chorus]

There ain't a chance we shouldn't take
Ain't a rule we wouldn't break
One boy, one girl
On the edge of the world

Danielle Bradbery,"He draws you into his flame
Takes you on a ride like a paper airplane in a hurricane
Looks you in the eye when he says your name
Midnight ride on a motorcycle in the pouring rain
Oo-ooh, he charms you senseless
Oo-ooh, leaves you defenseless

Wild boy, wild boy
Well, you can't catch the lighting shooting across the sky
But the moment you see him, you know you're gonna try
But he'll disappear without telling you goodbye
Oh, no matter what you think
You can't tame a wild boy
No

He's all danger and tattoos
A sugarcane devil, my favorite muse
He's a high stakes gambler
He'll sink you to the bottom, he'll fly you to the moon
Oo-ooh, you don't wanna want him
Oo-ooh, but you're gonna want him

Wild boy, wild boy
Well, you can't catch the lighting shooting across the sky
But the moment you see him, you know you're gonna try
But he'll disappear without telling you goodbye
Oh, no matter what you think
You can't tame a wild boy

Wild boy, wild boy
But the way he move sends a shiver down your spine
And he's a Roman candle burning up the sky
And he's a silver stallion running through the night

You can't tame a wild boy

We could do the Vegas thing, you could buy me a ring
Make a lot of love and a little bit of money
Go dancing in rain with the guitars playing
Down there in Memphis, how about it, honey?

Fine wine, sand, bare feet
Kiss me on the beach
So much to see

Come on, come on

Danielle Bradbery,"Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This world's gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
When the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other, come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say?
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?
Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days

Grandpa, everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wander back into the past
And paint me the picture
Of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget?

Did daddies really never go away?

Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause

Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where? It don't matter, as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together. I've got a quarter
Heads, Carolina tails, California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-haul van
Couple modern day Moses', searchin' for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas.
We can drive for a day, and then we'll take a look at the map

Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where? It don't matter, as long as we're goin'
Somewhere together. I've got a quarter

Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through a willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me

Lie awake at night drifting in my memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way, so soft to me

Warm as a morning sun

Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleepin'
And moonlight falls across your floor

Danielle Bradbery,"She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes

She went driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough, to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road, deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
Nobody knew she was brave like that

She went driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough, to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road, deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie

Yeah Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case

And she went driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough, to leave it all behind her

'Bout the places that I'd like to see

Ah, but he just stands there smilin' back at me

So I confess my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
Is there a brown eyed boy in my future, yeah
He says. girl you've got nothin' but time

But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born, you were born to fly

My daddy, he's grounded like the oak tree
My momma, she is steady as the sun
Oh you know I love my folks
But I keep starin' down that road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run

Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free

But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
But how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born
Yeah you were born
You were born to fly

It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast

She saw both her lives flash before her eyes

But I brushed my teeth anyway, got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face.
I got a little bit stronger.

Riding in the car to work, and I'm trying to ignore the hurt.
So I turned on the radio, Stupid song made me think of you,
I listened to it for minute, but then I changed it.
I'm getting a little bit stronger, just a little bit stronger.

And I'm done hoping that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around.
And ohhh
I'm done thinking, that you could ever change.
I know my heart will never be the same, 
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay.
Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.

Doesn't happen over night, but you turn around and a months gone by, 
And you realize you haven't cried.
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer.
I'm busy getting stronger.

Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

The children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills and the boulevard
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks like
Dennis hopper, Bob Seeger, sonny and Cher

Now, she feels safe
In this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that
She can't let go and she can't relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby, I sing

Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye

She still lives with her mom
Outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her
She's so pretty
But she'd be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
`cause even her smile
Looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils
In this angel town

But, everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye

About this place

And keep a straight face

Standing tall
To make his way
A man takes on the world
Holds his ground
He has so much he has to prove
And a woman does too

[Chorus:]
So baby lay down here beside me
Sometimes a man just needs two arms to fall into
And if you wanna know the truth
A woman does too

A woman does too
This woman does too

I like drinkin' red wine, but tomorrow my head sure won't

I like wearin' high heels, but tomorrow my feet sure won't

Danielle Peck,"Well, I look around and all I see
Are people just like you and me
They smile and wave and don't complain
On each dollar that they make

Some punch the clock with overtime
Sneak in to kiss their kids goodnight
Others work a long hard day
And still make time for PTA

When we get tired we get tough
But that's the way that we grew up

You've been [Incomprehensible] of my father
He's a workin' man who wears a blue collar
I was taught to work hard, play hard but pray harder
Well, I was prayin' about to get there quick
You got to build it brick by brick

I'm thankful that my mom and dad
Loved with everything they had
But let me make my own mistakes
That's the biggest gift they could've gave

There's something to be said about
Straight on knees and falling down
Getting' right back up again
And givin' all you have to give

I learned to walk by watching them
That made me who I am

You've been [Incomprehensible] of my father
He's a workin' man who wears a blue collar
I was taught to work hard, play hard but pray harder
Well, I was prayin' about to get there quick
You got to build it brick by brick

A swift drift up on an easy rock
Leaves you with nothin' but a long scar down

You've been [Incomprehensible] of my father
He's a workin' man who wears a blue collar

Oh, your halo's turnin' red
Foolin' around, knockin' me off my cloud
They're talking about your mischievous ways

Boy, it's painted all over your face
Stealin' a kiss, mysterious whispers
A thorn in my pride
I'm still by your side

But one day I'm walking away
The tide is gonna turn, I'm gonna find my place
Give me a reason to stay
I wanna be your lover, baby, but you can't behave

Remember the days and the Hollywood nights
And what happened to paradise
Stolen away and I can't replace it now
'Cause rumors are flying that I can't avoid

Are they true or am I paranoid
Livin' like this, it's drivin' me crazy
So make up your mind
You're runnin' out of time

'Cause one day I'm walking away

In a perfect world
Angry words are never spoken
In a perfect world
No one's heart is ever broken
True love isn't hard to find
It always lasts until the end of time
You would still be mine

In a perfect world
I'd be all you ever needed
And if leaving crossed you mind
At least I would have seen it
You wouldn't be so far away
There wouldn't be so many things to say
I know you would've stayed

In a perfect world
It's all so clear to me
I close my eyes and see
The way that it could be

It's like a rainy night and candlelight
And ooh, it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
Danielson,"Rowing, ringing, cares a flinging
As we ride this boat of hide
All eagle-eyed and dignified
Down the river, across the great divide

Words beside at the highest of tides
With my bonafide bride, she's my touring guide
And yes, we both do reside
On this riverside where we hide

Vacation's a lot of work
But here we are with ringing bells
And floating on this cockleshell
My pal grins, hugs the wind and sighs

We realize with our blank minds aside
Only to see the mystery of many books floating free
And those books are free indeed
There's one caught in the weed, let's get it

Go get that lovely book
Let's grab those lovely books
Gather up all these books
We're gettin' looks, looks
We're gettin' the looks

These lovely bloody books
Arms full of lovely books
Freely collecting books
We're getting funny looks

While we are stacking, organizing, filing
Piling way up high and rising
Dewey dusty, decimalizing
Sorting, tracking, systemizing

Can't believe we found this vintage
We now have such great advantage
Great they'll look in our library
Let's get goin?, let us hurry now, now, now, now

Hey, hey, hey, what do they say
Collections sit and beg to play
Wanting to give, and speak with us
But neatly packed and nicely put away

What to do for I've heard they are good
But we've also been told they can't be understood
By simpletons like me, and should never be
So why try

Crack in to all those books
The lovely bloody books
We open up these books
We takin? looks, looks
We're takin? a look

Time to hit the books
The lovely bloody books
Arms full of lovely books
Open up all these books

It's got the words of one who made the river
Blood that's flowing through the soil
I got books, I just don't read them
Cleaning scraps up from the table

Flippin? through with fingers pointing
At the letter and the numbers
Straining eyes and feeling better
Wonderin? how to be members, how now, how now

And I'm turning the page while on center-stage
It is starting to sink and I'm to the brink
With my plans in pencil, while the vision's in ink
What to think

My left brain tells me I'm a fool
My right brain tells me it's true, true
I only am knowing one thing
I like hearing good news, it's true, it's true, it's true

And it's false gonna cost myself for these books
Taking one second look
Gonna call my counselor now he's gonna clear
Clear confusion then explain everything

These books steer our ship with good news
For now I got nothing to lose
My brother remembers a thousand
I can't quote you one line

But, oh now I shall know all of your ways
With warm cockles in to my heart
And dancing to hits and skipping around
Around on unsinkable ships

They got treats and tricks, that dwarf mine anyway

Protects her children, so papa does bring

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true

Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true

Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable

Will find

Danity Kane,"Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby
Baby, tell me
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just too close to the heart, and
And I won't stand it if were broken apart

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

We've been cutting it close with the backwards and forwards
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing
So give us a chance

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now

Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that
I just can't hear that
And know
Wherever you wanna take me
I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me
Just tell me you hear me

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now

Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what it's like without you

I'm trying and hoping for the day
When my touch is enough to take the pain away
Cause I've searched for so long, the answer is clear
We'll be okay if we don't let it disappear

Stay with me, don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me, hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what it's like without you
So stay with me, just stay with me

I've searched my heart over so many many times
No, you and I is like no stars to light the sky at night
Our picture hangs up to remind me of the days
You promised me we'd always be and never go away
That's why I need you to stay

Stay with me, don't let me go

Just stay with me and hold me close

When the red light comes on I transform!

Look in my eyes covered in Maybeline
Looking like something fresh out of a magazine
I can be part of your deepest fantasies
You're the detective
Come solve my mystery

Some say that love,is all that I'm missing
Some call it Jezebel
I call it attention
But what they don't know
They can't even imagine
Say I don't have self-esteem
But its my passion

Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl, a bad girl)

I can be your addiction if you wanna
Get hooked on me
I, I can be your addiction if you wanna
Get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl, a bad girl)

When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

Something about me has got you hypnotized
Examine my body like you're the science guy
Watching my every move, you anticipate
What you're thinking about boy, I can re-create

Some say that love, is all that I'm missing
Some call me Jezebel
Call it attention
But what they don't know
They can't even imagine
Say I don't have self-esteem
But its my passion

Gimme that, baby come, come on!
I could do it all night to the break of dawn
On, on, and on
I keep on going
They call me a Jezebel
'Cause I freaks, I does it well
Got extensions in my hair
Bad girls, is ya'll up in hurr
Tonight we gon' just let it do what it do
I can flip this pretty young thing on you
I ain't looking for attention I just want you
Lemme be your addiction, I can be that too

I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me

I'm gonna scream loud 'cause I can't hear myself to the morning on you
And hopefully we'll then see a brighter day
We live with no regrets
Raise your hands if you're with me

We shall pledge to the highly upset
If you turn us down, we're gonna wild up yeah
I follow the sound of the rowdy crowd
We're gonna play hard until the sun comes out

We rage at the party like maniacs
Ooh, ay ay
We rage at the party like maniacs
Ooh, ay ay
Cause you're crazy, and I'm strange
Kind of rowdy, and the deranged
We rage at the party like maniacs
Ooh, ay ay

If you're raged at the party then scream it out
If you're raged at the party then scream it out
Yeah you can scream it out
Yeah you can scream it out

I'm headed downtown
With the lights awkward bright
And the music is loud
I really don't know, when I get there what I'll find
I'm sure it'll be turnt up

We rage at the party like maniacs
Ooh, ay ay

How could
Something so wrong, feel so good
Better than ever?

Stell erst mal das Duschwasser ab
Ich ruf mitten in der Nacht den Buchmacher an (hallo)
Sag ihm morgen 10 Riesen real (was geht man?)
All die Sorgen sind wieder egal
Klopfe auf Holz und schau hoch in die Sterne
Nein ich bin sicher nicht von dieser Erde
Fliege viel höher als ihr jemals werdet

Nur paar Frauen wissen wo des is
Hab von hier immer zu den Mond im Blick

Du musst mir nix sagen, ich weiß es ja selber, des sicher nicht gut
Doch fühle mich grade als wär ich am Strand, aber bin in der Hood
Ich bin abgehoben und war das schon lange, bevor ihr mich kanntet
Smokin u smokin ich hatte nie vor jemals wieder zu landen
Es gibt manche die meinen, der kann gar nicht rappen, was will dieser Typ
Und andre' die sagen, der ist doch behindert, rappt immer von Güz
Scheiß auf die Regeln im Business, mich lieben die Bitches ihr wisst es
Geht ihr lieber weiter ins Fitness, ich fahr durch die Gegend mit Pisstest
Bin nicht wie sie sind - Alien

Vielleicht tust du es ja mit jedem
Oder hast n Neuen, ich will den Loser gar nicht sehen (Nein)
Verdammt ich frag mich nur was du grad machst
Babe ich hasse es, dass du mich hasst
U wollte dir nur sagen, dass ich von uns sehr enttäuscht bin
Denn du weißt, du warst für mich mehr als nur ne Freundin
Wie konnte es zwischen uns so kalt werden?
Dachte wirklich mal, mit dir könnte ich alt werden
Heute können wir nicht mal normal reden
Wollte dir nur sagen, Babe du fehlst in meinem Leben

Und ich dachte echt wir sind nicht so, Baby

Schreib ne SMS doch schick sie nicht los
Zieh' noch stärker an der Kippe als sonst
Sag mal hast du noch die eine Halskette? Ich glaube kaum
Würd gern mal wieder in deine Augen schaun
Du wirst hierzu sagen, des is dummes Gerede
Doch nur Gott weiß, wie oft ich deine Nummer schon wählte
War nicht da, als es dir schlecht ging, doch Babe ich konnte nicht
Und trotzdem bist du was Besonderes
Schon 1 Jahr vergangen, kommt mir wie neulich vor
Es fühlt sich an, als hätt' ich meinen besten Freund verloren
Ich war oft ein Arschloch, das weiß ich auch
Doch auch du hast in der Zeit zu viel scheiße gebaut, Babe
Ich will dich nicht zurück. Nein
Doch du fehlst, muss ich dann verrückt sein?
Würd nur gern mal wieder mit dir reden

They open up their mouths but they don't know what they're talking about
She's in little need of someone to hold tonight
But if you make a move I'm willing to bet that she just might
Everytime she looks away you look away too
I know what you're thinking you don't know what to do...

You got to say.... (x2)
I want you more than anything (x3)
I do I do I do!

Time is wasting opportunity knocks then it's gone
Makes sense to speak from the heart 'cause you can never go wrong
Too many people telling too many lies
Go with what you know when the feeling's inside
I know you can do it if you start thinking ""Yes""
Yes I can, Yes I will, Yes I will pass the test..

She's got a brand new dress and she's ready to shine
Got her heart broke bad by some silly guy
Didn't know who the hell he had but she found out just in time
So tonight don't look for Mr. Right
You strap those tight pants on and walk in a straight line
Got the home field advantage cause you're one of a kind,
Pick yourself up leave your self doubt home and just...

So Baby who cares if you got your heart stuck
Stuck on a boy who only brought you bad luck
There's no reason for you to feel all bad
If the boy don't want to keep you just make him wish he had because...

It's Friday night and you ain't quite right
You got your back against the wall
But your head ain't on too tight
When you break your heart bad there's someting you outta know honey
One monkey don't stop no show so...

Strut Strut.. Turn the streets into your catwalk (x4)
Get out and get ready
To tell the world that you've arrived
Before you take it outside Honey
Remember to do it in style
Noody cares about second best
No one will know if you're too shy
Nothing gets done sitting on the fence
The hottest thing you got is confidence

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Danna Paola,"Ayer, en esta hora
En esta misma mesa
Tu sentado justo enfrente
Donde ahora se sienta tu ausencia
Me dijiste que te vas
Wooh

Dos docenas de mis años
Veinticuatro de tus horas
Atraviesan como balas
Una detrás de otra
Mi existencia
Me muero si no estás
Wooh

Y ahora que ha vuelto
El ansia del primer día sin ti
Y el presagio es tan oscuro
Que te juro que el futuro
Se presenta como un muro
Frente a mí

Sin tu compañía, tu calor
Tu sonrisa, tu mirada traviesa
Tus palabras sencillas
Pronunciando te quiero
Regalándome un beso
Que inundaba de luz mis mejillas

Sin tu telepatía, tus enfados
Tus risas, un poquito de todo
Lo mejor de esta vida
Se me escapa volando
En dirección al espacio
Que dejaste al marchar aquel día

Ayer al marcharte
Por aquella puerta
Te siguieron por la espalda
Futuras reservas de sonrisas
Y de felicidad

Hoy me sobran las palabras
Mis besos y mis miradas
Los minutos de mis horas
Cada gesto de mi cara
Y de mi alma
Eran por y para ti
Wooh

Y ahora que ha vuelto
El ansia del primer día sin ti
Y el presagio es tan oscuro

Un aroma perfecto
Y como me convences al mirar
Hicieron que te adorara

Ese abrazo era tan real
Parecía que todo era verdad cuando me decías que me amabas
Con un beso de película
Tu boca me atrapo y mi cuerpo se entrego

Pero todo fue un show
Una simple actuación me enamoro
Y mi alma te creyó
Pero todo fue un show
Como are para explicar al corazón
Que nada era lo que parecía
Que era ensayado lo que me decías
Y que la función se acabo

Quisiera poder hacerlo
Quisiera ser un poquito como tu
Y dominar mis sentimientos
Con un beso de película
Tu boca me atrapo y mi cuerpo se entrego

Pero todo fue un show

Y mi alma te creyó

No fue teatro, y si me amaste
Aun que sea un segundo, aun que sea un segundo

I'm finding it easier, to fall out
I can't deny it, I feel it inside
I'll keep it's fire, oh you can't hide

I'm falling in love again
Ain't nothing I can do
Falling in love again
And this time it's with you
When I fall
It's always the same
And I'm so tired of playing this game

Been so long now
Since I gave up my heart
I've kept it locked down
I don't wanna get it harmed
So let me tell you know
I just wanna be sure that you won't hurt me
Can you promise me that

[Chorus]

You got to tell me
If you're gonna break my heart
Cos I don't wanna take the chance
And if it ain't true
It's all gonna be
It nothing but a poor romance
So give me that promise to hold on
And I'll never let you go
We gotta have something to go on
I'm letting you know now

Never know how much I care

You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

I will not give you up

It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow

You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live",Freedom

Are the dreams all made solid
Are the dreams all made real

She pictures a soul
With no leak at the seam
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness comes
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and gray
Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day
There in the midst of it so alive and alone
Words support like bone
Dreaming of mercy street
Wear your inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of mercy street
Swear they moved that sign

Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms
Pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth
Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest-he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips
Dreaming of mercy street
Wear your insides out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of mercy street
Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms

Beatin' my head against the wall
Love can't be figured out at all
I thought the whole thing through
Don't know what else to do
I'm beatin' my head against the wall

What a situation
The perfect combination
We fit together like a puzzle
There was no mistakin'
A true love in the makin'
I didn't foresee any trouble

So how was I to know he'd be the two-timin' kind
Just sparin' me a heartache with his lies

[Chorus]

I looked him in the eye
Said this is my goodbye
You and I will soon be history
He fell down to his knees
Cryin' baby, please
Don't leave me, I'm so sorry

Now I'm all alone, thinkin' I'm the one to blame
'Cause his memory is drivin' me insane

I've heard misfortune blossoms
And wasted ways before me by the cause
Of giving someone time enough for spending
Love only borrowed

I've placed myself at ease
Listening to the lies and self-belief
Of wanting something close enough for keeping
A far cry from here

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Even still, the night's passing
Behind a heart, an emptiness still follows
The distance stands the swallow's heart from lending me
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Some are sad of truly knowing
There's belonging in just longing for someone
My shoulder rests a road I only follow
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here
A far cry from here
A far cry from here

Show me your everything I really wanna lose my mind
I wanna go crazy

Make me feel what you are thinking
Show me what is on your mind

Just keep it going I don't ever want this feeling to die

Tonight's temptation
Baby you're tonight's temptation
Make me want to move my body to you
And get closer to tonight's temptation

It is a party, the music is playing
And there is a crowd that's jumping and singing
The moment that I walked in the door
I spotted you out there, out on the floor
You can imagine what I was thinking when
I saw you and the way you moved
I was caught by temptation, a look at your body
I just want to get a little closer to you

Tonight's temptation
Talkin' 'bout tonight's temptation
Makes me want to move my body to you
And get closer to
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

Tonight's temptation
Baby you're tonight's temptation
Make me want to move my body to you
And get closer to tonight's temptation

Now I have travelled all over the world
New York to London at every party
But never have I seen someone like you who was
So sexy and knows how to move like you do
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Tonight (tonight)

If I could have you close with me tonight
Oh I would love to (love to) love you (love you) 'til morning light
Tonight's temptation
Baby you're tonight's temptation
Gonna move my body to you
And get closer to
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Talkin' 'bout tonight's temptation

Gonna move my body to you
And get closer to
Tonight, tonight, tonight

You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Tonight's temptation, tonight's temptation
Move my body to you
And get closer to
I wanna be with you (be with you)
You make me wanna move it (make me wanna move it)
You make me wanna groove it (make me wanna groove it)
You make me wanna party all night (make me wanna party all night)
And never ever lose the feeling of (feeling of)

Mmm ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Wishing boy, ooh

When I saw you the other day
I smiled but you just turned away
I had to say myself remember
He likes to stay in his shell all alone

As I went along on my way
I knew you had so much to say
The words were locked deep inside
That's alright I'll give you every sign that I can

Now I know a girl who's got a crush on you
But she is just a little shy and a little proud
Now you know you've had the time
To think it through don't make me wait
Another day, let it out

I wish that you'd stop wishing
And finally ask so we can get started
On a love that will last
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

As I sit here and make believe
I know that you are watching me
Your eyes are burning a hole through my heart

If there's a place we can start let's begin
Now it seems to me you want me to give in
And make a move showing you that I care
But my love is still a prize that you must win
Don't waste a chance to take my heart while it's there

I wish that you'd stop wishing
And finally ask so we can get started
On a love that will last
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

Wanna get started now, can we get started now ooh
I wanna get started now, yeah yeah
Don't make me wait another day
Cause you know you've had the time to think about me
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

I wish that you'd stop wishing

",Wish You'd Stop Wishing
Dannii Minogue,"It's dark and silent
Where am I?
Love surrounds my body
My eyes are closed, but I see
Colors have soothed the soul
Moving as part of this world
Taking it to ...floor
Diving deeper, backened by dolphins
They appear and dance around me
Brushing against my skin, tickling
I swim closer, speaking of thoughts ...are friendly
Where I stand
It's safe beneath the waves

Is this real
Is this real

*Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater

I come up for air 
I just want to prove everything is new ...seems to cool
And fill the water to a garden
Fruit ...from the trees
I reach up and take it
It's ripe, soft, and sweet
I feel there's a long grass
I run my fingers through the blades
Umm...feel inside me
I lie back closing my eyes
The song soothes me
I begin to float, floating higher and higher
Higher and higher

*Repeat

Everybody changes underwater

There's no darkness
Looking down, the world is ...
If I fall, no one will catch me
Space, everywhere I once and ...all
Floating in the small part of the endless universe
I feel glowing starts, Poseidon and ...
Someone to ...
A finding light appears
So it's a life I recognize
You reach out your hands
And welcome me like angels

Is this real?
Is this real?

Burning like the smallest spark

In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold
 
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold
 
I never made promises lightly and there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold
 
Many years have passed since those summer days among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down among the fields of gold

You can tell the sun in his jealous sky when we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold, when we walked in fields of gold",For the Record

I must follow you
I'm so nervous baby

So hot, I may want to take my clothes off.
Come inside, you're drippin desire, let the music make you rise up,
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

Come on and spin me on it, all my freaks say.
Put the needle on it, I could tell you where I want it,
Come on and spin me on it, all my freaks say.

I dare you now to be bad, do you want the best you've ever had?
You look so tame boy, let me wild you up.
Keep the lights dark and low, I'll keep you up all night,
Until you feel it vibrating through your bones.
Come inside, you're trapped inside, let the music make you rise up,
Dirty hands is what I demand, let the music make you rise up.

The one that stretches for success will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad

For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church

Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list

Why can't I pretend that it's all cool?
Don't wanna lose you

I might just close my eyes and
Sit tight, hope for the best

I can feel it comin'
I can feel it comin'
And I know there's gonna be bad weather
I can feel it movin'
I can feel it movin'
Now I'm walking in bad, bad weather
How can something so bad feel so good?
I can feel it comin'
I can feel it movin'
I don't like my chances without you
I can feel it comin'
Bad weather

Love is always easy to hold
But harder to keep oh
No use giving up when I've
Come this far, I'm in deep so
Why can't we pretend that it's all cool?
Don't wanna lose you
This cold burns through my skin
But I just can't give in

I might just close my eyes
So sad, I know (with you)
This cold burns through my skin
I can't let go

I can feel it comin'

I can feel it movin'

Used to be so appealing then
But now I know I wanna keep it real

I've been standing here
With one foot in a fairy tale
Now I'm opening up to tell you

From love to pain,and back again
Here's my invitation to you now
It's you I miss
The question is
Can you be the hero in my world?
And come back again

Forgive the past and believe
That I used be scared of love
But I've decided not to be afraid

I've been standing here 
With one foot in a fairy tale
Now I'm opening up to tell you

From love to pain,and back again
Here's my invitation to you now
It's you I miss
The question is
Can you be the hero in my worl?
And come back again

So many things to say
But I just need the answers
So put your arms around me baby

Danny,"L is for the way you look at me.
O is for the only one I see.
V is very, very extraordinary.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.

Love is all that I can give to you,
Love is more than just a game for two.
Two in love can make it.
Take my heart and please don't break it,
Love was made for me and you.

Danny,"You are the one who makes me happy
When everything else turns to grey
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings
And sends me out into the day

You are the crowd that sits quiet
Listening to me
To all the mad sense I make
You are one of the few things worth remembering

And if it's all true
How can anyone mean more to me
Than you
Sorry if sometimes I look past you

There's no one beyond your eyes
Inside my head the wheels are turning
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise
You are heart (you are my heart, you're my, my inspiration)

Just like the old love song goes (just like a love song)
You are one of the few things worth remembering
And if it's all true
How can anyone mean more to me

Thank you
(You are my heart, you're my, my inspiration)

Danny & the Juniors,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.
