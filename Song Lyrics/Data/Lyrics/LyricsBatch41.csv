Dark One Lite,"Coming to me in the morning, leaving me at night.
Coming to me in the morning, leaving me alone.
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.

Running to me a-cryin' when he throws you out.
Running to me a-cryin', on your own again.
You've got that pure feel, such good responses,
But the picture has a mustache.

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face,
Coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

You're coming to me with that soulful look on your face.
You're coming looking like you've never ever done one wrong thing.

So many fantastic colors; I feel in a wonderland.
Many fantastic colors makes me feel so good.
You've got that pure feel, such good responses.
You've got that rainbow feel but the rainbow has a beard.",Swlabr
Dark One Lite,"In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.",White Room
Dark One Lite,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!",Hotel California
Dark One Lite,"There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar.
Great expectations, ev'rybody's watching you.
People you meet, they all seem to know you.
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new.
Johnny come lately, the new kid in town.
Ev'rybody loves you, so don't let them down.
 
You look in her eyes; the music begins to play.
Hopeless romantics, here we go again.
But after a while you're looking the other way.
It's those restless hearts that never mend.
Johnny come lately, the new kid in town.
Will she still love you when you're not around?
 
There's so many things you should have told her,
but night after night you're willing to hold her, just hold her.
Tears on your shoulder.
 
There's talk on the street; it's there to remind you 
that it doesn't really matter which side you're on.
You're walking away and they're talking behind you.
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along.
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town.
Ev'rybody loves him, don't they?
Now he's holding her, and you're still around. Oh, my, my.
There's a new kid in town, just another new kid in town.
Ooh, hoo.  Ev'rybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town.
Ooh, hoo.  Ev'rybody's walking like the new kid in town.
 
There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it.
There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it.

Dark One Lite,"What kind of love have you got?
You should be home but you're not.
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still make you thirsty and hot.
I heard about you and that man.
There's just one thing I don't understand.
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire,
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

Victim of love, I see a broken heart.
You got your stories to tell.
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well.

Some people never come clean,
I think you know what I mean, oh.
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire,
Lookin' for love in between.
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine.
This ain't no time to be cool.
And tell all your girlfriends, your ""been around the world"" friends
That talk is for losers and fools.

Victim of love, I see a broken heart.
I could be wrong but I'm not, no, I'm not.
Victim of love, we're not so far apart.
Show me what kind of love have you got.

Victim of love, I see a broken heart.
I could be wrong but I'm not.
Victim of love, we're not so far apart.
What kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love.
I could be wrong but I'm not, no, I'm not.
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love.

Dark One Lite,"Well baby, there you stand
With your little head, down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe it's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

And you're back out on the street
And you're tryin' to remember
How do you start it over
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy to well, farewell

So you live day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To make them go away
I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time

Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together, we got to leave it alone

So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time
Mmm, hmm mm
Oh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, mmm mmm",Wasted Time

Dark One Lite,"We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocket ship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did

Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain

I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through pain
That's alright, that's okay
Let's turn the page
My friends called today
Down from L.A.
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
That's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way

Girl, don't go away mad
Girl, just go away
Girl, don't go away mad
Now girl, just go away, (here it go)
Don't go way mad
I don't want you mad
Come on girl
Come on baby
I said one more time
Girl, don't go away mad (don't want you mad)
Girl, just go away 
Girl, don't go away mad

Dark Tranquillity,"""Let me die"", I cried as the curtain fell
and I stared in woe at the world before me
My weeping eyes could not bear to tell
or the shattered kingdom in ruins before me

What became of the lands that were?
A pearl in the nest of memories
Forever gone...departed by the minds of man

Scavengers, feeding on your mother's blood
Parasites of life, with my heart I condemn
your ignorant ways

Like the leaves of the high trees
I wither and fall,
Borne by autumnal winds
to my funeral hall

I'm all alone in the grip of the silent sadness

I have been told to honour life
and what therein I'll find
but if all I see is darkness,
let me die and wake up blind
As the gleaming blade before me,
singing lullabies of loss
Whispering ""Death is your redeemer
to the Paradise you've lost""

Mankind, evoker of inferno
Let me burn your honoured Crown of Creation
and dethrone you to ashes for aeons to come

Why should I stay here where I do not belong?
Of weakness burns my within...And empty shell

I've lost the way to the sanctity I need

I'll greet the dawn that brings no life,
no frail beams of sun to cleanse the black night
My mournful roam has ended

I hide in the shadows white binding my time,
sheltered from this world which disorderly rhyme
with the fury of damnation

Once I held in my hand the starlight of Eden
and the white sky lay open in a soul that was free
(But the years flew so fast as the shadows were cast
and I woke up one morning with no reason to be)

I'm all alone in the shade of the nameless
Sorrow
I'm all alone within a shadowfire of fear

Take me home to whence I came
Where I'll find light to feed my flame of life

Or my heart will die without a whisper of hope...",Alone
Dark Tranquillity,"As false as our minds our eyes refuse to see
They claw for the falseness in me
From where all life springs anew
We are cleansed through the crystal fire

Fill me with sound, fill me with hatred
Let my blood bring life to the soil
The soil beneath my feet

Messenger of pain, sailing silence
Commander of my sorrow, riding rage
This is my garden, leave me be

Infinity is eternal
Never born so it may never die
The colours speak my name
Through the crowns I am baptised in the
First gnawing rays from a blackened sun
In the name of my blood I curse thee
Shelter me under the trees
Spread your twilight wings for me

My broken body is dripping with sin

Your skin so delicate in taste
Your undemanding bliss will carry me far

I bid farewell to this godforsaken land
Nevermore shall I return
I join with the riders on the horizon
For they are my blood
For they are my saviours
They bring me hatred, bring me fire
They take me down to the land I know not
They crush me, take me down
Then they build me once more again

Slayer of my anger
Sailing silence
The angel of my lust
She is tasting shame","Away, Delight, Away"
Dark Tranquillity,"A bolt of blazing gold,
Lifted from the horizon's edge
Another radiant dawn sends new hope,
Avowed my hearty pledge

My yearning to be part
Of nature's truthful solitude
Of wisdom's inner light
That shines in mystic multitude

The guiding source within,
So few of us will ever know
And few will ever climb
The great world-tree from which we've grown

But those who seek will find
The rhythm that vibrates high and far
And rearrange the cosmic threads,
The pattern of the Weave of Stars

A bolt of blazing gold,
A sunfire in zenith hurled
Oh, wingless skydancer,
Rejoiced upon the warmth unfurled

What wonders do you hold ensnared
With your mighty heart?
What secrets may be mine
To brother-share as we depart?

Of richest emerald forged,
My soul still rises, longingly
From inferno's winding caverns,
Through dark air soaring, restlessly

If silence was enough!
No words can grasp my starkest thoughts
No language known to man
Portrays my naked sentiment

A bolt of blazing gold,
Swallowed by the waveless sea
The ocean-winds set sail,
In breeze towards their destiny

On solarbeams they rode,
White sea-gull-wings in harmony
For a moment's startling glimpse
A sienna-burnt tranquility

Oh father of the coloured sky,
Unwear thy robe of shadowhood
Let nature's soul once clash again
'Neath blooming glades of goldenwood

We're the ones who seek
To dance to fallen serenades
The magic hymns of gold;
As softly sung, the sunlight fades away

Of richest emerald forged,
My soul still rises, longingly
From inferno's winding caverns,
Through dark air soaring, restlessly

Forgotten 
 
To the forgotten 
Internal sadness cured through the light 
To reach the saddest river in sight 
Whispers of molten souls in my ear 
On wings of twilight I am born
 
Now enthrone thoughts of the past 
The embryo of time 
Your life lies yet unfolded 
'til enlightened ways we see 
 
In my dreams I've seen repention 
As in tales that were never told 
 
Join us, in this quest to satisfy 
Join us, and none shall mortify 
I've seen the light unfurled by dawn 
I've seen the blackest ways we scorn 
We shan't conform, we shall remain",Unfurled by Dawn
Dark Tranquillity,"Enthroned through this age of confusion an urge,
The weakness and flooy since eons emerged,
Created life in fetters from cradle to grave
A future in darkness with mankind enslaved

Trail of life decayed, wasteland will prevail
Hatred lies in store, chaos evermore

So runs the spiel from where lives are found and lost:
""Learn from past failures, prevent to pay the cost""

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleak winter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm

When our time spells an end to our ruling of this earth,
Will a wasteland remain?
Will all life cease to be by the wicked ways of man
- his enfeebled domain?

Nature left in flames, Suffering, now to maim
Cataclysm at hand, unveiled unto man

So runs the spiel from where lives are lost and found:

Let disorder arise!
An avenge to be brought to the ones who graveled earth
Hides now cloaked in disguise

Tumbling, falling, brings conclusions,
Constant fatal life-corrosion

Raging with bleak coldness 'til

Dark Tranquillity,"Over the moor of mist and through valleys of fate
I fly on my voyage through this moonlit landscape
Of re-emerged figments of imagination
I am aroused in sleep, aroused in sleep

Far beyond the gate which reflects in the closed eye
Reveal that a dream scape lies therein
A yearning for a world
Where the everlost find their peace
In the pearly gates of dawn
On the astral feed of minds
Envenomed to the bone
Forever cleansed from all called wrath
As slumber sneaks upon
And steals the thought of man
All ridden from inner aggression

A voyage beyond this world
In this parallel to real life
Access lies in dreams
Unveil hidden secrets in our sleep
The key to what's beyond

In the wake of man we see
Essential dreams unfulfilled
Enhance the value of life
Engraved words on the page of man

In the presence of the moon
An owl awakes and calls a name
Tells a story of a world
Accessible only at night

""This ain't no dream""
Legend tells of a yesterworld
A dream scape of strange light
""It's your dream coming true""
Transcendence of the soul
All by the sign of the moon

That burn in the errors of our ways
In a night when the sky floats blue
As turquoise, and the stars of silver are twinkling
In their utmost pride

Now from dimensions fallen from the skies
Like the flow of a stream
From my sleep I continue onward
Sleep is just a shape of destiny

No sense of self, a denial of choice
It wants out so from all the little bits and pieces
A simple case of lost and found, a wicked new beginning

It's the oldest trick in the book, just like everything you always knew
Turned upon its very end there's nothing left to be
Half a mind to say all the things that bother me today
You better check if it's me, in that ""coffin"" of yours or just the one you thought you knew

I am one
Who am I?
No character to be lost inside

A mind is hard to please so wander aimlessly
Hands clenched in fists of rage concealed in frustration
There's a part of me that cannot deal

This haven of refuge, burn it to the ground

Bite down hard on frustration
The siege that can't be broken

So close without connection
Locked inside the sphere
I take the blame upon me
And scream at what I see

I'm blind at heart
So blind at heart

Dark Tranquillity,"Dreamed up a new word today
In my ignorance I gave it meaning
Who was I to know

To say it is to know it
To hear it is to believe

I dreamed the world would end
I was not wrong
To doubt, to discredit
The other words I've heard before
From inside a shell pretending

It's all you've shown your faith
And what you've always known
So lay your trust in the unthinkable
It's time to justify your lesser faith

It's all your faith has shown
And all you'll ever know
Why do you matter, you're insignificant
How can you justify your lesser faith?

To know it is to fear it
To feel it is to say no

To break, to cast it down

From the staff that must be broken in two",The Lesser Faith

And wasted what was given
To revel in your mess

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield
Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death

Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find?
Go now, until there's nothing left
Go now, the dying has begun

It is the only place I know, where death is most alive
It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive

So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face

Whatever happened to integrity?
Imagination is a curse in all of this
Whatever happened to the ones left behind?

This is a ghost town, bodies dragged through endless streets
Go now, to never return

If I had horns
Would there be flames to shy my smile?

Hymns of loss are heard
From the masses in the streets
Praising the last of days
I punish

Bring me the night
In the fires that never end
The dawn will never come

The charge of cosmos
Charging at us from unearthly distance
I challenge the universe
It's the choice between heaven and hell

My soul bears all the weight of mountains
As mankind weaves its silent end
Can there be no forgiveness?
I curse the heaven above me
As the light sinks through
My outstretched fingers

Fading in my open arms

Make each tear in my bare hands
A lifetime in hell
On this last day of light
When our autumn leaves fell
And as heaven itself commands me
Out of its lair
My face lined with darkness I'll go!",Punish My Heaven [Demo Version] [#]

Direct the agony to a non response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

And the camera finds them beaten up by grief
Do you wonder that they get up every morning
And sometimes don't believe?

When you see their eyes reminded
Of another day not shared
With a child who never turned to say goodbye
Are you comforted by somebody you love
Or do you keep it down inside

Can you feel?, Can you
From every breaking dawn
Through to midnights ghostly toll
I thank him for the life
In your northern soul
Every time you cry
And sulk back to the fold
Through your misty eyes
I see your northern soul

When it's down to just page seven
Even on a slow-news day
Do you pause before you turn over the page?
And although there is no photograph

No tears on television
Do you find yourself reminded of their eyes?
Can you feel?
Can you?

At every roadside shrine
Where faded flowers console
I shudder for the life
Inside your northern soul

Every night you sleep
I'll lie down on your pillow
And I feel each steady breath
From your northern soul

When every light's gone out
And my body's tired and old
You'll keep my spirit young
With your northern soul

God every way it breaks
I'm bound to make it so
To turn all fear to love
With your northern soul",Northern Soul
Darker My Love,"A father said to his son
""you should be waking up. Your salvation is here, your
Eyes will open up
All the times that I said you wouldn't understand, I
Meant them""

Wait forever to see the child locked inside everybody
Is free there is no need to hide
To decieve is to flee from the opened eye

Snuff the silver wasp
To waste the gifts of man and all the things that I
Said you didn't understand."" said sir hexagram

Lifted from the bones lifted from the sand
Perched upon a gate he waits with bird in hand.

When the fabric of being fades, fate leads you to an earthly grave

Embrace the temporary

To the never ending life that was purchased at Calvary

Take comfort in knowing precious earth is worth sowing
Blessed are those who seize the day
Because it will all soon fade away 
This world will fade away 

We will come to know this world is not our final destination
We weren’t meant to occupy thrones that were built on condemnation
To live life without meaning leaves a stain of deceiving, 
Blood stained earth meant for more than hurt

Leaves me questioning,

This twisted reality, 
There has to be,
Substance in inconsistency, 
Weaving time and reality, 
Is faith the only thing holding up my belief? 
In the darkness my eyes show me,
There is so much more that I can't see,
How defined can I be?
My fate is dependence fueled by needs,

Who will you help? 
When the whole world bleeds,
How will you help?

My existence, 
Father will You come and show us,
How to live again?

Affirms my humanity,
I boast not of my sufficiency, 
But to demand of Your authority, 

Is this the point for everything that I'm feeling,
Is compassion supposed to drive my yearning?

Wasn't just mine from the start,

I'm writing you this letter just to let you know
even though through out the years my feeling never showed
You were just a little girl when I fought for mi clicka
I remember times I had no peace of mind
You see I had to hussle cause I couldn't find work
I didn't know that when I left that your feeling were hurt
daddy please don't go the streets are bad
how could I explain that I had to be a man
risking all my vida every hour of the day
I always cruise around looking every single way
just to take you to the park I always said tomorrow but I said that every day
then I'll kick it in the barrio mija understand daddy only wants the best
the day you were born I knew that I was blessed
Now I'm ready to change
I know it the only way
let me wipe your tears cause your daddy's here to stay

daddy's home and I'm here to stay
No need to cry cause I'm not going away

It's the rage of my god please don't take me away
I want to be with my family but I killed a man yesterday
You saw 'em coming up and your face showed fear
don't take away my daddy and I couldn't wipe your tear
They shoved me in the car mija please don't cry
they were taking away your daddy and you didn't know why
let me go I'm a man and I wana be free
found me guilty so they sent me to the crazy penitentiary
Now I never see you cause you hardly ever visit
You had your quincianera and I missed it
to many long years and I couldn't see you grow
You're the only one I love but you didn't even know
I looked through my letters
to make me feel better
I could tell your little tears dried up on the letter
I miss you daddy cause now I'm grown
times are getting hard when your daddy's never home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry little mija that I chose this route
I didn't realized what this life is all about
I waited for this moment for so long
I don't know how I lasted feeling strong
Now I'm standing by your side and I'm here to stay
I'm never gona let anyone take you away
Forget what I did
'cause I was never there
'cause you just got to know that I'll always care
I missed it all your first day at school
Every single birthday man I played a fool
How could I have been so blind
The love I was looking for was their all the time
I see your face and you cry I felt the swelling in my chest run deep inside
Querida your my angel the girl of my dream
Even though in the past I did some crazy things finally daddy's here
To wipe your tears away put your head on my shoulder cause daddy's here to stay

After becoming romantically involved with a black-clad stranger
Her mouth showed telltale signs of blood for the first time.""

If I Ever Love Again

( Written by Curtis Wright / Billy Spencer )


I felt a little uneasy when you walked in

But I'm glad you agreed to see me once again

If for no one's sake but mine

While I've got the chance this time

I want to tell you just what a fool I've been



There have been a lot of changes in my life

And there's a long list of wrongs I'm making right

But of all the things I've done

Hurting you is still the one

Mistake that I keep making in my dreams every night



Chorus:

But if I ever love again

I know one thing for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



When I think about the man I used to be

It's no wonder that you just gave up on me

But standing here today

I just want to say

It's my belief in what we had that finally set me free



Chorus:

And if I ever love again

I know one thing for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



If I ever love again, I'll tell you honestly

I'll do my best to love her just the way that you loved me



Chorus:

And if I ever love again

I promise you for sure

That if I ever love again

It won't be like before

Cause losing you's the price I paid

To learn that love is only made to give

If I ever love again



If I ever love again

A shadow appears on center stage
And sings a haunting melody
While a distant fiddle plays

He's the phantom of the Opry
A grand ole spirit from the Ryman days
He just feels at home here
He don't really mean to haunt this place

Some say it's Hank or Lefty
Or that Kentucky Bluebird flying back again

There's a ghostly sound of steel guitar
Crying in the night
Does it come from center stage
Or from somewhere on the other side

Just set fire to memories, and watch us go up in smoke

My Girl Friday

( Written by Curtis Wright / Carl Jackson )


She stands there with her suitcase

We've been through all this before

I know it's gonna hurt me

When she walks out the door

I wish things could be different

We didn't have to say goodbye

But someone else is in the picture

And we don't see eye to eye



The minute that she leaves here

She'll run straight to their arms

Gotta find the strength to let her go

Even though it breaks my heart

One last time I'll hold her tightly

And kiss her on the cheek

As she rushes to the car I'm left

To face the lonely week



Chorus:

She's my girl Friday as far as I'm concerned

I'm lost without her, don't know which way to turn

Thursday takes forever and Monday comes too soon

But at least she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon



She stands up in the backseat

And softly waves goodbye

I look away before I want to

She don't need to see my cry

I know that I'd go crazy

If it wasn't for the fact

I'll always be her daddy

And they'll have to bring her back



Chorus:

She's my girl Friday as far as I'm concerned

I'm lost without her, don't know which way to turn

Thursday takes forever and Monday comes too soon

But at least she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon



Yeah she's my girl Friday 'til Sunday afternoon

'Til Sunday afternoon

Where to go and what you're gonna wear
And you've got to pick your lipstick and your high heels
And figure out someway to fix your hair
Lord the burden that you bear

Try getting over you
If you want something hard to do
I can't believe you'd call me up
Just to say you've got it rough

Come and take one bitter taste
Of the hell I'm going through
And try getting over you

There was bound to be trouble when she burst Bubba's bubble
And he found out she was doing him wrong
Then right about ten Bubba walked in, the crowd did a double take
You could've heard a heartbreak

[Chorus]
You could've heard a pin drop, even the jukebox stopped
No clinking glass, no belly laughs, no whispers, no small talk
Just silence all around and that little cracking sound
That only one thing makes, you could've heard a heartbreak

We thought for sure when he saw her there was gonna be hell to pay
I said hurry someone dial 911, get an ambulance on its way
Then he dropped to his knees, said, ""Come back please. 
I'm sorry that I treated you bad.""
Like a small earthquake he began to shake, never seen a sight so sad
She said, ""I've had enough. 
I've fallen in love. Boy it's just to late.""
You could've heard a heartbreak

[Chorus: x2]

That only one thing makes, you could've heard a heartbreak
You could've heard a heartbreak",You Could've Heard a Heartbreak

Darrel Petties,"It's hard to understand sometimes
Is there a master plan
How do I make sense of everything I'm going through

But maybe it's not ours to know
So we have to learn to let things go
And simply try to make the most
Of every day and have the faith
That somehow we will find our way

So count it all joy, all that you're going through
Even when you're feeling down
Count it all joy, each moment's a gift to you
So turn it all around
And even in the darkest night
If you look hard enough
There's a trace of sunlight waiting there
Yes waiting there for you

Been searching everywhere to find
That rainbow in the air
Whenever I came close it just seemed to disappear
I had to change my point of view
Start looking at myself
I can't believe I never knew
Everything that I need
Was right here yes inside of me

So count it all joy, all that you're going through
Even when you're feeling down
Count it all joy, each moment's a gift to you
So turn it all around
And even in the darkest night
If you look hard enough

From today I have the faith
That somehow I will find my way

Even when I'm feeling down
Count it all joy, this moment's a gift to you

Darrell Scott,"I'm southern born and corn bred
My folks are just the same
I got my southern heritage
I got my papaw's name
I fell in love with a little girl when I was six years old
She had the name of Martha White and she had her own radio show

You see, Martha had a brand of flour, for biscuits, cakes and pies
She had Shirley Temple golden curly hair and southern, baby blue eyes
And on Saturday nights with my guitar, I'd sit and play along
I knew every word and every note to that Martha White hour theme song

Well my folks took a vacation down to Nashville, Tennessee
Bought me a Goo Goo Cluster and a front row seat to the Grand Ol' Opry
And there before my childish eyes was that high and lonesome sound
But nowhere on that Opry stage was Martha to be found
Well I finally found my Martha out in the Opry stars' parking lot
She was cooling off them up and coming boys
You see they were Billboard hot and they were 
drinking something out of a brown paper bag
I knew I'd lost my Martha the only love I'd ever had

Oh, they're all better looking than the ones who went before
Same old hat, same old voice
Can they give us nothing more?
They're all smiling for the cameras, walking softly, talking loud
Martha, she still makes those biscuits greasy, fluffy and proud
You got your French croissant and all that Italian pastry-chef voodoo
You just pop one of them suckers in your mouth, slivate and chew
But what you won't find on the shelves of the finer kitchens of the world
Is the face of our self-promoting, self-perpetuating, self-rising flour girl

You only get it in the southland
That's where demographics best
It's the brand that Mom and Daddy bought | They won't give the girl a rest
And it's the same as it ever was from fifty years ago
She ain't mortal like you and me
Martha White will never grow old

They're all better looking than the ones who went before

Can they give us nothing more?

Darrell Scott,"Old Joe Clark he made his mark when cotton was king
And late at night 'neath the shanty light you could hear that banjo ring
It would ring out for the master who was listening on the hill
And it would ring out for the babies who were sleeping quiet and still

Round and round old Joe Clark
Round and round, I say
Round and round old Joe Clark until the break of day

When he came out of the belly of that ship of 
Slavery he was holding to his banjo but it was not on his knee
And someone said, ""Hey here's a strong one and he can entertain
So we'll let you keep your banjo, but Clark's gonna be your name""

Round and round old Joe Clark
Play it when I say
Round and round old Joe Clark or they'll carry you away
Round and round

He learned to play the melodies of Cork and county Claire
He even played for Lincoln once, outside the courthouse square
Then he went down to New Orleans, they call it Dixieland
But everywhere that old Joe played, he was still a hired hand

Gets you a cane pole in your hand
Fry a mess of fish up on the bank
Cross that Mason-Dixon line, leave your cares and worries behind
Sit out under a willow tree and think
Head south, are you listening
You don't know what you're missing
From Virginia shores to the Gulf of Mexico
Head south to Kentucky, Blue Ridge Mountains if you're lucky
From the Florida Keys to the banks of the Ohio

Country soul down in Tennessee
And that mountain music's all right by me

To a farm where Big Richland River winds

Darrell Scott,"A farmboy from Kentucky Hills
Learned to play guitar for his backpoarch thrills
Lean a ladderback chair on a windowsill

He must have got it up in Michigan
He and his brothers were pickin then
When he moved to Gary he took it with him
That Gibson Hummingbird guitar

Oh how that guitar would ring
Dad would close his eyes and sing
Silver Haired Daddy would always bring a tear to his eyes

I was all of five years old
My brother Don and a kid down the road
We just did what we was told to get outside and play
Someone wrapped it in a coat
And we took it to the swamp just to see if it'd float
But a Hummingbird is not a boat
And it sank straight away

When he got home that's when he heard
What we'd done to that Hummingbird
And he looked at me and never said a word
Just went out back to see

And there it was in all it's mess
With the cattails and the redwing nests
And there he laid it down to rest for all eternity

One of these days you know what I'll do
Get a Hummingbird guitar and a brother or two
Underneath a Kentucky moon, give him back his childhood dream

Darrell Scott,"He left Boston in December for New Mexico
Determined to forget all of the faces he'd known
A little lonesome and a world of troubled mind

With a bed roll on his shoulder and a banjo on his knee
He would hitch a ride with truckers, he believed them to be free
Eighteen wheelers roll a little further down the line

He did not meet a girl in Richmond nor in old San Antone
His vision of the Southwest would be realized alone
Alone to wonder how his life had gone thus far

As he walked along the highway
He felt a power from inside
He found a miracle of living
In having nothing left to hide

He walked Carlsbad to White Sands
For forty days and nights
But it only took ten minutes for that man to realize
Lord, it's lonesome everywhere

Now he's living back in Boston, teaching English in high school
Glad to have bi weekly wages
Glad the kids all think he's cool
He's a man who has learned from where he's been

He keeps a bottle full of white sand on his table down the hall
And a worn map of New Mexico thumb tacked on the wall
Oh, you never know, he may need to go again

As he walks along the hallway
He feels that power swell up from inside
And finds a miracle of living
In having nothing left to hide
Oh, it's a miracle

",Miracle of Living
Darrell Scott,"It's been rainy and windy for seven days straight
I've been going to bed early and getting up late
I look out my window and it's one shade of gray
My wife and my kids don't have much to say
A man out of work only gets in the way

Oh, the river is rising now one inch an hour
And tonight we'll be lucky if we still have power
But I've got a flashlight, an oil lamp and I'm ready to go
And a fresh set of batteries for my son's radio
If the dam really breaks, least we'll know where to go

River take me, river take me
River take me far from troubled times
River take me, river take me
River take me far from troubled times

If I had a boat you know what I'd do
I'd float me and my family down to Baton Rouge
I wouldn't work in no factory, I'd live off the land
And live within means of my own two hands
Dance Saturday nights to a Zydeco band

Oh, the river flows and a young man dreams
And the river can drown you or it can wash you clean
It can take you away to some other place
It can power your cities, carry your waste
And give all that you drink, a peculiar taste

Oh, don't look to me, I've done my time
You see, I've had too many dreams for this one heart of mine
And I've stood on the bridge with the river below
Feeling all of the sadness that a proud man could hold
Oh, the river is full but there's no way to go

",River Take Me
Darrell Scott,"He was not my father’s brother
But he wished that he could be
Told us kids to call him Uncle
And we would be his family

He had a wife and kids in Fresno
The youngest one was twenty-four
Dad had brought him into our house
But they didn’t want him anymore

He helped us work the family business
Building fences in the sun
And worked just like a man of twenty
Till the working day was done

He and Dad would spend their evening
Sitting in lawn, chairs in the yard
Where they’d drink a toast to Seagram’s
Seagram’s never went down hard

Won’t you wake up, Uncle Lloyd
Got a lot of work today
We’ll get Don to make the coffee
Load that truck and be on your way

Friday night you can drive to Vegas
Maybe this time you will win
Buy a trailer by the river
And you won’t have to work again

He was sleeping in the workroom
With a mattress on the floor
When one night I heard him crying
As I passed outside his door

He cried, ""Rita, girl, I love you
Rita, darling, please don’t go
I’ve tried hard to make you happy
I’ve done everything I know""

Then I heard the bottle open
The tipping up and putting down
Heard the rustling of the covers
And then he did not make a sound

I thought of thirty years of Rita
Standing sternly by his side
All the years of hanging in there
And all the emptiness inside

And I thought of how their children
Have children of their own
And how a man at fifty-seven
Winds up living so alone

Won’t you wake up, Uncle Lloyd
Got a lot of work today
We’ll get Don to make the coffee
Load that truck and be on your way

Friday night you can drive to Vegas
Maybe this time you will win
Buy a trailer by the river
And you won’t have to work again
Work again

Darrell Scott,"Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite.

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride.

Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress.

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.
I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
I saw the glory in her eye.
Myself I long for love and light,
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?",Joan of Arc
Darrell Scott,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold wind blows
That old liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well, there she goes my friend, she's rolling now at last

Here the mighty engine roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, high above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

Yeah, I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

",Early Morning Rain
Darrell Scott,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind

But I will leave, I will leave
If you can't live there

Now tracks they take me backs to you I go
And night descends
On wires
And TV lights reflect off every window
Like blue flickering fires

Now I believe, I believe, I believe
There's a house, a street, to plant your feet
And I will leave, I will leave, I will leave
If you can't live there

If you can't live there",Ends of the City
Darren Hanlon,"I wish that I was beautiful for you
I wish that I inspired tiny fireworks inside the way you do
So delicately made
A prayer left unprayed
Before the morning sky fades
Up to blue
And I wish that I was beautiful for you

I wish that somehow I could find a pill
For a quick fix modern tonic that would change me with one swallow I would kill
Watch folks line up to pay
Stare at me all day
But I'd turn them all away
If that be thy will
One tiny little innocuous pill

But a wish is just a pin
In a swimming pool of needles
If for one night you need the room
I wish to be your tomb
You can lie in me

Is it possible I've other things you need
But to be worthy of a single page out of one of those magazines you read
As glossy as a mirror
But mirrors never lie
They're difficult on the eye
It's true
And I wish that I was beautiful for you

I dreamed that we were traveling on a bus
Speeding along an unnamed plain towards somewhere and nowhere there was us
Our hands lay useless in our laps
Like beetles on their backs

We came to a stretch of road where a fire
Had burned the edges all along it looked as though the highway wore eyeliner
You kissed me by surprise
When I opened my eyes
You'd turned into some old guy
I screamed
But don't forget of all these things I've only dreamed

If for one night you need the room
I will be your tomb
You can lie in me",I Wish That I Was Beautiful for You
Darren Hanlon,"Step into the great outdoors
After all it would be wrong to stay inside
I know
When the first chimney takes its chances
And despite their branches all the leaves decide
It's time to go
And cover up the crimes
Of the seasons passed before

Every footpath leads into another footpath
I can't find the place to stop
The endless chore
But it's time that I went visiting
These guys I know who've bought themselves a shop
A record store
A humble hole in the wall
Could you ever want for more?

I'll be hanging in the record store
Store
Store
Oh

Do they find me annoying?
My constant questions cloying?
Oh

I have seen you when your skies get overclouded
And your eyes are breeding grounds
For tears
You could do worse than come on down
To a place that's built to specialise in sounds
For sore ears

For years they'll search for other cures
Your life's a film, who writes the score?
I'll be hanging in the record store
Store
Store
Oh

What treasures in the shelves
For he who searches, she who delves

Astral physicists explain
The mysteries that surround it
But the record stays still
While the world spins around it

All the rest are vicious lies
Callous and unfounded
The record stays still
While the world spins around it

Yeah the record stays still
While the world spins around it
The record stays still
While the world revolves around it",Record Store

Darren Hanlon,"I've chosen to remember you exactly as you are
If looks could be pickled and stored in a jar

1997 trapped inside a conversation
That party was so loud I felt like an abbreviation of myself

Finally got around to vacating the nest
But my knowledge of survival was pedestrian at best 

Now I'm holding down a job penning poems by the kilo
Our guest is dressed by hand-me-down, hair designed by pillow

Tie shoes in bows
Walk tall in those

Don't start counting your pennies; the night is but a pup
There's things happening above you must remember to look up
And you will marvel at how it's so easy to forget
A moon that hangs so bright you could've lit your cigarette

The light that it throws
Smash through windows

We're singing words the meaning's long forgotten
Corroded over time
The air's so thick you'd swear you're breathing cotton
You've fallen down a mine

Assuming your own nom de plume
Invite someone back to your room

Every person and their spouse
Lay entwined throughout the house
While meanwhile on another couch
I've the pleasure of finding out the difference between north and south

With his mechanical moving mouth he said â??These are my principles, 
If you don't like them I've got others.
This is my opinion, if you don't agree I've got big brothersâ??",The Unmade Bed
Darren Hanlon,"Today I left my house in shorts
But now I'm having second thoughts
Something's not the same
The wind just called my name

So I stop to look around
Maybe it was just sleight of sound
It's just me and my bare knees
Power lines and trees

But one hint is more than enough
It starts with a sniffle and a cough
When posters have stopped falling off my wall
The winter takes fall

All of these past regrets
Are faded signs of missing pets
It's time for moving on
Everyone else has gone

Eyes a red pattern like the labyrinthine streets of Cairo
Feeling as used as a bank biro
My cylinder inside
Has dried

Warmer months I'm more at home
It's easier to be alone
Why don't I just pick up the phone and call?
The winter kills fall

And all of these fledglings that you've found
And given homes
Will hunger for the new
And colorful

A signal from your eyes could save me
They shone like car keys to a baby
Should I settle for romance?
Or practice disco dance

These gatherings are fraught with dangers
The conversation chops and changes
I wish us away in our mangers
A crowded room but total strangers all

Darren Hanlon,"On the journey that you take from womb to worm
You're silently pushed into each wrong turn
What gives?

I found a bar filled up with ancient Chinese sages
All playing bingo, pinball
Could've stayed for ages
In there
In there

For I belong with them
I wish I'd have met them sooner
Although I'm alien
And over thirty years their junior

But it's not me to make like a chandelier
So I folded up my map and drained my beer

Can you tell me I want to know

And this is all I want to say
I guess I miss you beautiful

Why I can't concentrate

Spinning round and round

Why I now understand the beauty and simplicity in everything surrounding me

It sounds ridiculous but when you leave a room
There's a part of me that just wants to follow you too

Chasing away the summer heat
Footsteps outside somewhere below
The world revolves I let it go
We build our church above this street
We practice love between these sheets
The candy sweetness scent of you
It bathes my skin I'm stained by you
And all I have to do is hold you
There's a racing in my heart
I am barely touching you

want to taste every drop

A kiss that lingers takes me in
I fall asleep inside of you

There's only truth
Breathe in Breathe out
There is no sound
We move together up and down
We levitate our bodies soar
Our feet don't even touch the floor
And nobody knows you like I do
The world doesn't understand
But I grow stronger in your hands

Creepin up on you 
Is the wrong thing to do
I found your address
Got your phone number too.
Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
Been to secret places you think nobody knows
If I have to live without you
Nobody could
I need to be around you, watching you

No one else could love you like I do
Feeling when I'm creepin up on you
I know that it would be right 
If I stayed all night
Just to be around you
Creepin up on you
Creepin up on you
I been hanging around all the places you haunt
Spying on your friends to find out what you want 
Drinking from a glass that you left on the bar
Follow you around driving home in your car
Do I have to breathe without you
Cause nobody could
I need to be around you, watching you

[Chorus]
I know this must be wrong
It can't go on
This kind of thing is taking all my sanity
And making me a mockery
This must be wrong 
It can't go on
So won't somebody free me from this misery
Bring my baby closer to me

No one else could love you like I do

Darren Hayes,"Been spending so much time underground
I guess my eyes adjusted
To the lack of light
I got
Covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

I have been waiting
Always waiting for something new
Happiness has always ended
In the blink of an eye
There was no one attending
No one attending

It doesn't really matter where it all began
All I know
I got covered in darkness
Covered in darkness
Ever wonder why I never really truly connect
Although my eyes are open
I can hold your gaze
But I am never connected
Never connected

I am famous for my generosity
They say I am the kindest
But it is easier to
Give than receive love
Give than receive love

It doesn't really matter where it all began
All I know
I was covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

Turning pages over
Run away to nowhere
And it's hard to take control
When your enemy's old and afraid of you
You'll discover that the monster you were running from
Is the monster in you

Better to hold on to love
Better to hold on to love
Change will come

It doesn't really matter where it all began
All I know
I was covered in darkness
Covered in darkness

It doesn't really matter where it all began

Darren Hayes,"I've been down a lonely street tonight
And I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
The clouds cover up the Dublin sky
I don't know what's left of me
I don't know what's right with me
And I've tried to keep my distance
And I've sung Amazing Grace
I've tarnished all our memories
But there'll always be a trace of you
Of you

I remember laughing on that river's edge
Trying to get you to jump with me
Trying to get you to fall for me
And your trembling heart it beat so fast
Holdings hands you promised me
Holding hands we counted to three
And I felt your slipping fingers
And I saw you change your mind
If I hadn't dragged you in with me
You would have let me dive without you
Without you

They sent you all the way from Hollywood
And maybe that Dublin sky was changing you
It put diamonds in your eyes
I always thought we were going to make it through
But I wanted to hear it first from you

How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all those years?
Held down by these tears?
How many dreams have I left deserted?
How many hopes have been diverted?
Have I been buried in the dirt?
Held down by this hurt?

How many loads did I let you hijack?
How many ways can I stand here in playback?
How did I end up lying here
Crying underneath the Dublin sky?

How many days am I going to regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all these years?
Drowning in my tears?

Letting go of you ego
Thought I'd let you know

It was so irritating saving face
When I fell from grace
Thought you'd won a race
Without a trace

But you stayed
But you remained
But you
It's always about you

I have been quietly edging away 
To keep the flames at bay
Make this puppy stay
To limit my use of personal

See I just said me
You're an endless see

The vanity is all for you babe
For you babe 
For you
It's always about you

I have been silently taking offense
And at great expense
As my feeling dent
I'm licking my scratches

It serves no purpose
Doesn't gratify
And you're dissatisfied
And though you're belly's full

Darren Hayes,"Somewhere inside my evolution
Karmically I seek retribution
Looking for love in physical beauty
Desire is the drug of the bourgeoisie
And now I try to intellectualize
Like a glimmer of good in a bad man's eyes
I am consumed by the flesh haunting me
I know temptation taunts the empty

So pour yourself over me
Until there's nothing left to see, yeah yeah
Because I like the way you move in the dark
I like the tension, the tension and the spark

The decadence of giving into desire
Creates such entropy within
Looking for love in spiritual faces
Blind to the art of fabrication
I'm like a baby sucking mama's milk
Want to drink my fill and then some
Leave me alone
I always thought I was better than this
But temptation tempts the temptee

Pour yourself over me
Until there's nothing left to see, yeah yeah
Oh, because I like the way you move in the dark
And I like the tension, the tension and the spark, oh
Because I like the way you move in the dark, oh
You know I like the tension, the tension and, the tension and the spark, oh

This physicality
Shifting me chemically
Such power over me
It's just desire
I know it's treachery (shifting me chemically)
I know it's just skin deep (such power over me)
I know I should resist
I'm just too tired

Is my skin untouchable?
Do I remind you of a part of you that you don't like?

You make me feel like my mother, she abandoned me (you abandoned me)
You make me feel like the act of love is empty (I felt so empty)
Am I so unlovable?

Darren Hayes,"I've seen so many faces
These hands have lied before
I've kissed so many lips it's blocked my mind
I've whispered bullshit, nothings
I've cried alone in night
I thought I'd found the one a million times

But doesn't anyone fill the void?
Doesn't anyone kill the joy?
Doesn't anyone take the place of you in my heart?
And doesn't anyone fill the void?
Doesn't anyone kill the joy?
Doesn't anyone take the place of you?

I let a stranger love me
I gave away my pride
I bit my lips, so I could block my mind
I've called your name to others
Just like a spinal chord
Severed and broken but the spark still tries

And doesn't anyone fill the void?
Doesn't anyone kill the joy?
Doesn't anyone take the place of you in my heart?
Doesn't anyone fill the void?
Doesn't anyone kill the noise?
Doesn't anyone take the place of you?

They don't know you like I do
They don't see the good inside you
They don't lie with you in bed and join you when you're dreaming
They don't see your softer side
Who'll be there to turn your light on?
Who will try to wash away the stain that love has left us?

Doesn't anyone fill the void?
Doesn't anyone kill the joy?
Doesn't anyone kill the place of you in my heart?
Doesn't anyone bring the noise?
Doesn't anyone kill the joy?

Darren Hayes,"Everybody's beautiful
When they're young
And I should know
I've had more than my share of fun

There's all this fascination
With the impossibly thin
With the surface of things
Airbrush Photoshop creation

In all that we are losing
Aren't we just confusing
Youth with beauty
Truth with duty?

There's something on the telly 'bout North Korea
Some war broke out, don't trust the media
I'd like to get a suntan
Some dude was shot in Pakistan

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
Track's got noddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

I was walking through the city
Past a phone shop and a homeless man
Was lying there, looked almost dead
And no one seemed to bother

I ran into a rock 'n' roll band
Two or three of them, maybe four
This one punk just nineteen years old
He gave me his persuasion

He stared at me with his one black eye
Looked down on me like I didn't have a life
And he was right
At least not the kinda life he'd been paradin'

Same sex union
Change the constitution
You can carry a gun
But you better not fall in love with someone

The President who fucked the world
For every future boy and girl
Is golfing in Aruba
With a suntan and scuba

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage

Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage
Moves my boddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

Now everybody dies or fades away
A permutation white and gray
A synergy of light and dust
And skin cells constantly aging

You fell in love with the dream
To fuck forever endlessly
But you don't, that's okay
The rest is better anyway

Botox bungle, CNN
Infomercial count to ten
Change the channel, VCR
Somethin' on my radar

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't want to talk about it

They've got those bombs up in the planes

With the windows down
And the beat up stereo
Struggle with this town
'cause you love to hate it
And hate it to let it go

And we're all alone
And so tired of being
Underrated
So don't take me home
'cause I feel alive
When you come and save me

A yellow car
Speeding down the South side freeway
We'll rewrite this movie
Make it end like we want it to

And Casey

Can you come and find me
Wanna be beside you

All the pain will change
Into a memory,
Of when we were amazing

1989
Summer had hit
But it was not moving
What is it with this town?
Every time we win
It just feels like losing
We were never gonna fit in
I was a mixed up kid
And you were my sanity

In a yellow car
We don't even have to go far
'cause that song you're playing
Sounds like peace on the radio

Just me and God
It's raining
It's raining hard
The windows
Are steaming up

Engulfed by fog

The rust of
The metal bridge
It beckons
It pulls me in

I scream at God
And what he's offering

And turn my light off

And bite the feeder

I'm driving
I talk to God
He's screaming
I only nod
I need to
Be where you are
The leaves and trees
Are shaking

It's raining
The bullets melt
The hunger
Of hunger itself
It's draining, but pain has reservoirs
It keeps for itself

[Chorus]

I'm falling
I'm not myself
I'm diving
I'm underneath
The hull of
A mighty ship
That steams away from here

The bubbles
The surface race
They shine and
They replicate
I hear it
The Voice of God
Is laced with sarcasm
In your hands

And my thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no light
How's the way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the feeder
No more lingering

Darren Hayes,"When I first escaped the city of York
And leapt out of this cage
No silicon chip could sublimate
Or tame this temptuous rage

When my heart was in the attic
Like the picture of Dorian Gray
I was rescued by the enemy 
That dare not speak it's name

Say hello to your future
I'm just pleased to meet you
You were a million miles away
Say hello to your lion's heart
Queen Victoria's England
Will never ever be the same
Giddy up!

When I left the warm surroundings
Of my selfish difficult stage
When our eyes first met there was deja-vu 
And a feeling I could not shake 

Then gravity seduced me 
And drew me to this place
I could swear we were together
In an entirely different age

Say hello to your future
I'm just pleased to meet you
You were a million miles away
Say hello to your lion's heart
Queen Victoria's England
Will never ever be the same

So wonderfully good looking
With fine and delicate lines
If I place this face in carbon freeze
It will never be affected by time

She said ""Don't confuse your beauty
With the insolence of youth. 
You can move through time in one direction.
Sad but it's the truth""

But it took so long to meet you
But it took so long to meet you
It took so long to meet you

It's time to go
It's time to leave
You should never have come

Get back to the craft
Get back to your age
Take somebody with you
Giddy up!

Say hello to your future
I'm just pleased to meet you
You were a million miles away
Say hello to your lion's heart

Will never ever be the same

You got Paris in a new sports bra
You got therapists to justify your behavior

So full with generosity
I've something else to say

And pretend that nothing's wrong
And if a feeling comes
Just call me in the morning

Darren Hayes,"If I have understood correctly
Velocity equals the distance traveled
Divided by time
I've read every word ever printed
On quantum physics
And now it is time to try
I read your book, I found your notes
I dusted this thing off and turned on
The key
The rumbling motors
The buzzing incredible gadgets
The hissing electricity
And now the moment has come
I'm traveling back in time

They're running down the hall

And you're five
Always running away
And I was dying to kiss you
And I
I don't want to cry
I don't want to see
Where the moving van takes you

Pass the place where I grew up
Number nine Lake Road
Pass the swimming pool
And Mable park
And past Troy Clifford's house
To the Argonaut ?
To the fish and chip shop
Out the back and down the road
To the place I got beat up

Hey, put that rock down
Can't you see he's half your size?
Hey, he looks familiar
Oh my god, he's me, age nine

Put your shoes on
And run away from here
I can't get involved
This is all so weird
I'm meeting myself
This is all so clear

All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted
All I never did
All the dreams I had
All the things I would change
I can change them

All the things I've lost
All the people I've hurt
All the times I lied
All the moments wasted

I'm gonna make right
What I did wrong
And change how the future has come
Through appliance of science
I'll take a hold of my enemies
Take their obscenities
Kiss them, and leave them like lovers who've gone
I'll call my dad
I'll tell him I miss him
And tell my reflection: 'it's not your fault'

Tell me what to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time right up
So that I don't leave here all alone. Woo hoo!

Did you ever get the feeling that the universe is leaning?
It's accelerating, it will never stop
Did you ever wonder if the number one divide by zero
Is infinity and if that's the case then what?
If imaginary numbers are abstractions of the real thing
Then could someone make the clock of time stop?
If we were always meant to be together like forever
Than it must have been a future shock

I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing to sing 'til I drop...

What to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time
Right up so that I don't leave here all alone

I don't know what the future will bring
But I am willing to sing 'til I drop (Gonna speed those sands of time right up)
Oh darling, I don't know how it happened to be
But when we met it was like future shock

What to do, me myself and I
It's gonna take a time machine
To get it right
And it's so cruel, I wanna take you home
I'm gonna speed those sands of time
Right up so that I don't leave here all alone","Me, Myself And (I)"
Darren Hayes,"Long ago when mercury descended high on the moon
Far below when little hands are making shapes in the room
The shadows they dance and they cheer up this place

The face that's staring through a tiny crack in the door
Eyes so wide, he's never seen a woman fall on the floor
I swear daddy's killed her this time

Should I make a rocket?
Should I try to fly away?
Should I make a hammer?
Should I try to smash his face?

Should I make a bullet?
Should I try to shoot the gun?
I'm sure the judge will let me off real soon

Long ago when saturn tried to find a way past the sun
Deep inside a little boy is turning pain into fun
The pencils, the crayons, the paint colors run

The plans are forming slowly made with scissors and glue
Eyes so wide, he's telling mommy all the things he can do
He'll sketch a contraption to save them for sure

He can draw an alien
He can come and take them home
He can draw a cartoon
He can draw a safety hatch

He can draw a hot bath
He can plug a toaster in
And wait till daddy's nice and warm
Toss it in

And then when he's gone
There's a neverland of fun

Take a loaded gun
Take a shot of rum
Take a poison rat
There's a lesson in that

No more closing fist
No more face to hit
No more bloody nose
Or apologetic roses

Long ago when mercury descended high above the moon
(Should I make a rocket? Should I try to fly away?)
Far below little hands are making shapes in the room
(Should I make a hammer? Should I try to smash his face?)

Long ago when saturn tried to find a way past the sun
(Should I draw a cartoon? Should I draw an alien?)
Deep inside a little boy is turning pain into fun
(Should I draw a hot bath? Should I plug a toaster in?)
",Neverland
Darren Hayes,"A serpent, a rabbit, a walk in the forest
A tentative looking sun
A feeling, a moment, a bursting of bubbles
A panic to overcome

A samurai, an angel, an etiquette table
An AC that does not work
A road trip, a car wreck, a paperback novel
A lover who ain't been hurt, damn it

When you let me go, when I'm on my way
When the world below is cold and gray
On the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
A resurgence on the edge of something wonderful

For it, against it, said he'd never meant it
But Harry still dropped the bomb
A trip to the dentist, the Hollywood black list
A moment that time forgot

When you let me go, when I'm on my way
When the world below is cold and gray
On the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
At the edge of, on the verge of something wonderful

You can dance in the devil's shoes if you like walking in heels
And there's a decent living to be made in the selling out of ideals
You can lose your way in the big city
Get distracted and lost and feel pretty

I want you, I need you
I don't wanna please you or belong to anyone
But life is for leading, for not people pleasing
A race that has never been won

When you let me go, when I'm on my way
When the world below is cold and gray
I'm on the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
At the edge of, on the verge of something wonderful

On the verge of, on the verge of something wonderful
A resurgence on the edge of something wonderful

Darren Hayes,"In a world so cynical
You came in and changed the ball
From black to white
And made me right
This is all atypical
No one else has had the time
To read the signs
You are the only one

No one else can keep me from
The danger of myself
You keep me stronger
You are the only one

And now I love you even more
Than I did before

I've got such a jealous side
Reaching out
I try to hide
My infant stride
And in my mind
This is all so prototype
Make it wrong to make it feel right
Don't deny it
'Cause you are the only one

No one can keep me from
The danger I possess
You keep me stronger
You are the only one

And now I love you even more
Than I did before

And when they make the call
For one last drink
When my self-esteem seems below
And when no one knows it
When the colors all collide inside
Well, I can barely hide
You are the only one

No one else can keep me from
The danger of myself
You keep me stronger
You are the only one

And now I love you even more
There is no other
No one else I place above you
You are the only one
And now I love you even more

Darren Hayes,"Leave me alone, come over here
I know it sounds funny
But I just can't stand another day on my own
Another bug in my ear sounds like noise to me

Living alone, a chill in the air
I don't hear from my brother
He is living in another continent far away
And it was his birthday today but I think I missed it

Setting sun
I think I'm heading for a setting sun
Oh, I really need to find a way back home
Oh, it's so urgent, there's an urgency

Leave me alone, get out of here
Still chasing my daddy, singing songs about my mammy
Got to let it go before I go down with the ship
There's my heartache sinking

Leave it alone, put it to bed
Everybody changing memory
Set in the pages of an e-mail or two
Yeah, I read all thirty two, it was love prized out of you

I think I'm heading for a setting sun
Ooh, I really need to find a way back home
Oh, it's so urgent, there's an urgency

Behind the setting sun
I think I'm heading for a setting sun
Ooh, I really need to find a way back home
Oh, it's so urgent, there's an urgency

Do I make you hot?
Do I make you uncomfortable?
A stirring down in your soul
For something more

Does it happen a lot?
Does the drudgery bring you down?
Is anyone still around?
I'm coming down

Do I make you hot?
Do I make you uncomfortable?
A stirring down in your soul

If this is what you need, pry my fingers from your hand

Maybe it's just meant to be

Come back and sing a melody to me

Maybe we're just lost at sea
Maybe I'm holding on to driftwood
And I'll be alright if you could sing to me, oh
Sing to me, oh

You step beneath the landslide
Nothing feels right when you're wrong
And try to find an upside
Try to sing without a song

Darren Hayes,"From the top of a church on a hill
To the tip of a dragonfly wing
From the shine of a hood of cab
To a shimmering diamond within on a ring
That was worn through two world wars

From a smile that soars though its old and worn
And two blue eyes forever seem in cold, oh

The sun is always blinding me with her light
The day is always hiding behind the night
And one day everybody will be alright
Go on blinding me with her light, ooh

From the glare of a red traffic light
To the blur of a bicycle wheel
From the flare of a camera lens
To a fluorescent light that ignites and displays
Someone leaving a goodbye note

From a pen made of steel and reflection of hope
And it took some words to stir an aching soul, ooh

The sun is always blinding me with her light
The day is always hiding behind the night
And one day everybody will be alright
Go on blinding me with her light

From a fire that burns in the darkest well of a cave so enslaved
I can hear her yell, I can tell this bird just wants to be free, oh, no, no
So set her free, ooh
Ooh, and if this world should ever leave you cold, ooh

The sun is always blinding me with her light
The day is always hiding behind the night
And one day everybody will be alright
Go on blinding me with her light

The sun is always blinding me with her light
The day is always hiding behind the night
And one day everybody will be alright
Go on blinding me with her light, ooh

Darren Hayes,"Daylight breaks, and the black birds call-
And the market stalls are all filling up, spilling over the streets.
High above, over Notting Hill
I am floating still, in a wooden chair, with our restless dog.

Been away so long, I almost forgot how time and space
Cannot replace this feeling of flying over things.
Now you're falling awake, your sleepy face begins to register
That I'm coming home- yeah, I'm coming home to you.

[Chorus]
On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will float through your window.

Major third, or a minor seventh
I'm a violin tuned a little sharp, tuned a little below.

Coming around the bend, the hallway ends.
The chair it dips, and then it bends
And it has wings for legs.
Now you're deep in a dream, the sheets and pillowcases seem to overtake your head.
I'm at the foot of our bed.

[Chorus x2]

Break through the silence, the gulf that's between us.
Take all the heartache and bullshit that builds up.
And we will unravel, unravel the moments.
Yeah we will unravel, unravel the moments.

Oh

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
Over bluebells, over Blackheath.
Calling your name, I will come to your window.

On a Sunday only we know, where the sunlight and the wind blows.
On a Sunday only we know,
I'll be calling your name as I float through your window.",The Tuning of Violins
Darren Hayes,"The professor is building
Something extraordinary
From the first signs
Well I knew he would hide it from me
Clang, clang, rattle, and buzz
There's a helicopter blade
And a bit of a truck

He's got no more quality time
To be going on adventures
Spending mornings on Blackheath
Using a Ouija board
Or finding hidden places
That had never been sought, I pray
Origami full of grace
The professor is mad
And he's working a feverish pace

Diabolical delicious things
Something is bad
And it's something within me

[Chorus]
Do you know?
Do you know?
What is he building in there?
Gotta know
Gotta see
What is he building in there?
Gotta know
Gotta be
Something destructively daring
Disastardly it's got the best of me

The professor is building
All kinds of devilish device
Won't part with a singular bit of enlightenment
Bang, crash, glitter, and bug
There's a phonographic needle
And a stereo heart

He's got no plans to make an announcement
No preliminary sketches
Or advice to impart in me
One ounce of jealousy
Fifty-seven gallons juvenile delinquency

Super supremacy
I've gotta find an answer
Gotta fashion a skeleton key
Diabolical delicious deeds
Something's bad
And it's shrouded of secrecy

[Chorus]

(There are really four dimensions
Three, which we call the three planes of space
And a fourth
Time)

The professor is building
Something extraordinary
Behind bars
And a door he won't open for me
Kind words and the barrel of a gun
Will make him come to grips
Make him face up to what he's done

Darren Hayes,"I have been angry for so long I let you know
Should?ve walked way when I was young, I let you go
I turned away but maybe I was wrong

Been polishing blame for so long now
My pride and joy
Been in tragedy never hurt
Somehow this man became a boy
You took the blame but 
Maybe I was wrong

Oooh

Walk away now and be gone
You don?t have to want to go on
I can see it?s killing you
You don?t always have to be so strong for me
Every angel had dirty hands
Even Judas planned to just carry on
Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes
You can walk away 

You have been silent for so long I let the world know
I turned a bit of my pain into a song then carried on

You took my shame but maybe that was wrong


Walk away now and be gone
You don?t have to want to go on
Even when they?re killing you
You don?t always have to be so strong for me
Every angel had dirty hands
Even Judas planned to just carry on
Just picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes
You can walk away

Now and be strong
I know you can carry on 
Walk away now and be gone
Cause you don?t have to want to carry all the pain inside you
Cause the blood in me is your blood every time I fall

Walk away now and be gone
Even when its killing you
You don?t always have to be, so strong for me
Walk away now and be gone
Cause you know even Judas planned to just carry on
Still picking up the pieces of what lies behind those sorrowful eyes
You can walk away

And now and be strong
You don?t have to carry on

Walk away now and be strong

You don?t have to wanna go on

Walk away now and be strong
You don?t have to wanna go on

You don?t have to be strong

They don't understand the gravity I've fallen into

Forgive me, love, I can't give you up

I'm lighting candles for you and I
I pray for a love, resurrection

They don't look into your eyes or tremble like I do

Well your gaze always ends up there
There’s a touch of the insincere

Well nobody is keeping score
But we’re winning a cold, cold war
And I feel so cowardly

Only slightly less than I loved you, loved you

To be the one

Well your body can move in close
But my heart is a lonesome ghost

Darren Hayes,"What if I told you that your time was up,
That as every second passes there's a moment gone,
In 23 hours the sun is gonna set forever,
Would you hug a little tighter,
Would you let go first,
Would you focus on love then forget the hurt,
Live in the moment or wish your life away,
How would you spend you last night on Earth,
Would you kiss your enemies,
Say sorry first,
Would you take enough time to say your last goodbye,
All the little battles that you never won,
All the music and the opera never sung,
Emotions that were silent all these years,

You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
You can't smell the roses,
No it's not a rehearsal,
You only get one life so make it right,
You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
So live every moment like this is the last night on Earth,
Because this is the last night on Earth,

What if I told you that I had regrets,
I would trade in all my happiness for one last kiss,
For a minute or two lying by your side,
What I chose a road no-body walked,
If I arted all my promises with empty talk,
If I knew back then the things that I know now,
I would tell you that I love you then we'd all get low
There are Peaks and there are Valley's,
You've got to know,
Second chance,
You've really comes around

You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
You can't smell the roses,
No it's not a rehearsal,
You only get one life so make it right,
You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
So live every moment like this is the last night on Earth,
cuz this is the last night on Earth,

If I could have my time again,
I would make sure,
You knew just how I felt,
cuz I went away for much too long,
And the seasons change,
Without me,

You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
You can't smell the roses,
No it's not a rehearsal,
You only get one life so make it right,
You can't smell the roses when you're gone,
So live every moment like this is the last night on Earth,
cuz this is the last night on Earth,
cuz this is the last night on Earth.",Roses

Slay me with whispers

Angel to comfort me
Cradling my head in your hands

And the fog cleared, I saw you 

And I want you and that’s so terrifying
And I want you to help put out the fire
Cause I am an island, you are the ocean
And all of my sadness taken by the sea

Fall, I took a fall
I took it easy
On the surface I was perfect
But down, way down below
I started believing
I deserved it
Was I worthless
Sinking like a rescue boat
Washing right over me
Vessel is struggling
Waving both my hands in the air
Then the blindness of love
Then your arms all around me

And I want you and that’s so terrifying
And I want you to help put out the fire
Cause I am an island, you are the ocean
And all of my sadness taken by the sea

And I want so much to believe
That I won’t disappear in the water
That I won’t always be swimming against the tide

And I want you and that’s so terrifying

Darren Lord,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Like a child in a dream we belong together
This love was born from out of the blue

It's bigger than the both of us
Stronger than you and I
A gift to cherish from above
Plans to keep alive

I'm finally off of that merry-go-round
Since the day you headed in my direction
I can't keep my feet on the ground

About how we care for each other
Keep a good watch on the promise we made
If the fire dies down we'll build another
If we just do that this love won't fade

And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right

There's been such a change in me
Since I felt your touch
Everywhere I go it seems folks
Can't get close enough
Is the whole world in love
Or is it just us

When you walk with your head down
All you see's the cold hard ground
But I looked up in time to catch a glimpse of you
If everyone on God's green earth
Knew true love and what it's worth
They'd know how I'm feeling
And share my point of view 'cause

[Chorus]

Everywhere I go it seems folks
Can't get close enough
Is the whole world in love
Or is it just us
Is it just us",Is It Just Us?
Darryl Worley,"There's an old friendly breeze that blows in the gulf of Mexico
Somehow it always knows when I'm feelin' low
So I'm gonna anchor down and wait till it comes around
Leave the rest of the world behind, that's how I'll pass the time

Till I catch my second wind, get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back when you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here until I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in till I catch my second wind

There's a peace in the way I feel when the water's still
And as long as it's calm out here I've got time to kill
But as soon as it starts to stir I'll lose track of the way things were
Float away on the open air, but I'm not going anywhere

Till I catch my second wind, get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back when you stopped loving me
I guess I'll just stay out here until I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in till I catch my second wind

Darryl Worley,"I show up for work on time at least five days a week
Punch that clock and toe the line just to make ends meet
Every day on my way home I pass them neon lights
But I been thinking all day long about stopping in tonight

I might get a little sideways
Like I did in the old days
Every once in awhile you know
I slip off the straight and narrow
Sitting down on a bar stool
Cutting up like a dang fool
Now and then on Fridays
I might get a little sideways

I'm gonna call my baby up when that quitting whistle blows
Girl put on your dancing shoes and grab my party clothes
Meet me down at the rendezvous on highway seventeen
We'll stoke up that jukebox and let off a little steam

Darryl Worley,"I don't have a lot, but I'm proud of what I've got
I can't complain
'Cause I see people hangin' round, on the city streets downtown
Living on pocket change
There're times I've been confused, felt that I was born to lose
Oh but I survived 
Unlike the one's who pray and feel more than blessed each day
To just be still alive

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
The only hope they have will die
In the hearts of you and I if nothing's ever done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just turn my head
And walk on by
Don't let me be a stranger to those less fortunate than I

Seems that old golden rule, that I learned back in school
Has lost its shine
It's a crying shame, and I wonder could the blame 
Be yours and mine
Discipline was tough, and that old principal was rough
But the times were good
'Cause no one ever found one single child shot down
In the neighborhood

Is there something we can do
Seems the odds against survival are a million to one
'Cause every day that passes by 
Another street gang victim dies 
And still there's nothing done
I can't save them by myself
Oh but God forbid that I just run away somewhere and hide
From the fear and the danger of those less fortunate than I

In the comfort of my home

I wouldn't mind the shackles if it wasn't for the rattle of the chain

It's sad but I admit I listen closer than I did

And I'm torn between the pleasure and the pain

I wouldn't mind the shackles, I knew the day she left
That I'd be wearing them until the end of time
But every day's a battle just to keep the burden of my heart
From interfering with my mind

Ringing in my ears, driving me insane

I don't know any reason we should let the whole town know
Which one of us came up with this plan for letting go
Try to leave me just a little pride to get me through
After all I gave you it's the least that you can do

When you run into our old friends could you ask them how I've been
And maybe even muster up a teardrop now and then
If they ask you how you're doing, what's it really gonna hurt
To tell a little lie and do your best to look your worst

You keep my old love letters in the closet down the hall
And leave at least one picture of me somewhere on your wall
Could you do your best impression of a sentimental fool
After all it seems like it's the least that you can do

Oh I know it won't be long till someone else is loving you
And waking up in your arms just the way that I used to
Promise me at least one time you'll call him by my name
And when I'm with somebody new I'll try to do the same

If someone ever asks you why we went our separate ways
We were just too much in love might be the thing to say
Or maybe you could tell them I was just too good for you

Just about a mile above the Pickwick dam
Party on the water, whole lotta fun

We'll drop these anchors out where the big boats are
Break out a cooler, pass out some ice cold beer
Look at all the people out here on the water

Checking out the honeys baking in the sun

Standin' in the presence of the past

[Chorus]
Brother fightin' brother
Father fightin' son
By the time the sun was settin'
Looked like the South had won
Now my mouth's as dry as cotton
And my heart is beatin' fast
Standin' in the presence of the past

Sunrise caught the rebels sleepin' and they woke 
To hear a Yankee bugle blow
Bullets flew like angry hornets
Till the peach tree blossoms drifted down like snow
It must have been like hell on earth
What happened here is more than we can grasp
Standin' in the presence of the past

[Chorus]

Brother killin' brother
Father slayin' son
From the looks of this old graveyard
Hell nobody really won
Somethin's changed inside me
It sure can happen fast
Standin' in the prescence of the past

A mist halos the meadow and a soft wind
Breathes a whisper through the trees",Shiloh
Darryl Worley,"I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten all the people killed
Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

Have you forgotten
Have you forgotten",Have You Forgotten?
Darryl Worley,"I woke up early with a poundin' in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did
I said, ""Lord, please forgive me for my sins""

My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first
""You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church""

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer, watched a game and cooked some steaks

My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And my poor mother sat between 'em both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life is like a Roller Coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight

You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or I might live on for years

He said ""I love her, she hates me, and I drink.""

I don't put much stock in their gain

Throw a line out in the water every now and then

And tell him a couple stories on his father

Overdrawn underpaid same old daily grind
Trying to get a leg up barely getting by

You see lowdown women
Love a lowdown man like me

Lowdown women need a lowdown man

Hanging out in here and being one of use

Bring that credit card
And wear them funny shoes again

That ain't the way it's meant to be
Its just lowdown women

Darryl Worley,"Me and the boys were on the bus one night
Talking bout the way is was when times are hard
Trying to find a way
Somebody went and got a guitar out
We started passing 'round a mason jar
I don't know how it happened
But it turned out just the way it should

This ain't nothing but a party song
The kind that makes you want to sing along
A little good old fashioned honky tonk
That's what I'm talking about
It's country music with a nasty groove
It's gonna make your sexy body move
Before you know it there ain't nothing wrong
You're in the middle of a party song

It ain't supposed to be rocket science
It ain't calculus or chemistry
Just something funky you can feel
Down in your bones
It'll pick you up when you get down
Might be the universal remedy
Just take a look around this place is rockin'
Like the Rolling Stones

Cause everybody loves a party song
The kind that makes you wanna sing along
A little good old fashioned honky tonk
That's what I'm talking about
Its country music with a nasty groove

You turn around and all your blues are gone
We're gonna get you with a party song

Darryl Worley,"He walked into Dusty's Place last night
I said something about that boy ain't right
He drank a half a dozen double shots
Walked to the dance floor and picked his spot

Then he closed his eyes and dropped his head
Folded his arms across his chest
Slowly started swaying side to side

That's when I walked up and said are you okay
He had big old tears running down his face
He said not right now buddy can't you see
I'm slow dancing with a memory

I just waited until the song was through
I asked if there was something I could do
He said not unless you can bring her home
Then 'he stopped loving her today' came on

Then he closed his eyes and dropped his head
Folded his arms across his chest
Slowly started swaying side to side

I walked back to the bar and old dusty said
We oughta throw that fool out on his head

Tasting something good to eat
Feeling grass on my bare feet

Here I am behind the wall
All alone
And there ain't no way out
Paying for the things I've done
And all I have is time to think about
All the things I'll never do again

Going fishing after church
Loving her so much it hurts
And crying now and then
Laying down for a good night sleep
Making love so soft and sweet

Just a good cold beer every now and then

They talked me into a shot and I was feelin' fine

I was laying on the bathroom floor
I got up but I got right back down
That old rug started moving up under my feet
I put a big bear hug on that big white seat

It ain't no lie I went to sleep last night

the house would start to spin
I swore if I got out alive I'd never drink again

I say hey man, what's going on?
He said I don't know where to start

Sarah's old car's about to fall apart
And the washer quit last week

It's just a common case of everyday reality
Man I know it's tough but you gotta suck it up
To hear you talk you're caught up in some tragedy
It sounds like life to me

Well his face turned red and he shook his head
He said you don't understand
Three kids and a wife depend on me
And I'm just one man
To top it off I just found out
That Sarah's two months late
I said hey bartender set us up a round

From the jump niggas know, it's Yellowstone for life
Tap a nigga dome, act a phone with the right
It's a four car collision, when my chrome hit the light
X-ray vision, when I size niggas up
See two wheels fall off, when I ride nigga what
two four, three sixty five, hugging the block
I'm in the hundred, Trae in the six, Doug in a drop
Letting it up letting it down, hauling the tops
Two pigeons on the dashboard, snub in the spot
Since you got your mask on dog, mug my dot
Many pieces be separated, when slugs pop out
Some niggas chase paper, some niggas try it
Some niggas want a piece, some want the pie

Representing for the S.U.C., with P.O.K to the E
Why we so fly, but gangstally motivated
From corners we educated, so hatas get confiscated
Rated by these pit bulls, and these untamed guerillas
Mic wreckers and head bustas, we owe ya then we gon get ya
So niggas better get the picture, if not then you long gone
Throw your motherfucking set up, 'fore you get your chest gone

Made to the back, it ain't time no for the champ 'plexing
I grab for the gut, tell everybody be dropping flat
And ducking from the S.L.A.B.er, wood grain when I grab a
Drop it trunk knocker, on choppas looking for boppers
And wrecking the parking lot, at every club
Sideways tripping and tipping, when I'm on Dubs

Never knew nothing to me, cause I'm too thoed for them rookies
Look the streets made me, streets love me and streets hate me
So the streets pay me, motherfucker it's all gravy
Want it all baby, never gon let the money change me

As the chains of the flesh left me
As the moans and the groans

I flashed ... that my soul was Unharmed
As my earth form I shed
That the image of death had been
A thought in my head
And the truth was a spirit am I
I sussed ... that my life had been a lesson
Chosed by me
For to purify my Soul that I may be
Worthy to shine forth the Light

The Light
As I moved ever up-ward
A Great Light there came
More feeling than seeing
And it filled me with Shame
Like a Bright Shining mirror reflecting my being
My present condition of Soul I was seeing
I Beheld ... Forms of Great Beauty
That shone forth the Light
With love vibes they met me
A cast off my fright
Those great souls of Ages long passed
I praised the Great Souls of the Ages
Who care for our needs
Who lovingly nurture
Wisdom's bright seed
Showing the way to the Light
The Light
The Light
I ached ... for the womb and the Earth
And another time around
Seking circumstances
The best that can be found
To give me the lessons to learn
I was Born ... and through childhood
My soul still rembembered the Light
And through teens I fought fiercely
For my vision of the Light
When I saw Mum and Dad had forgot
The Light, The Light, The Light!

Now I'm sorry
So do you mind if we just skip
To when we're friends again
What do I have to say?
To get you to see it my way
'Cause all I want is you
And all I want to do
Future you calls to make plans to see bands with me
But now you is mad at me all the way till yesterday
It's been a long year since we've had a chat
It's gonna be a few more before you smile back
And in the meantime we could be fine
Just buckle up and close that hatch
'Cause all I want is you
And all I wanna do

Twenty-twenty-one, I've said and I've done
What any good friend would have
Twenty-twenty-two I've had it, I'm through
I'm quittin' on you, I'm turning my back
Twenty-twenty-three, you're looking at me
But you really can't see I'm there
Twenty-twenty-four, I don't care about the score
I can't take it any more, and I don't care

'Cause all I want is you
And all I wanna do
All I want is you
And all I wanna do",Time Machine
Darwin's Waiting Room,"You took one final look, my tears they turned to ice
A frozen sacrifice, your body's heat's my paradise
I've built up many layers but none can keep me warm
Deceiving is believing in the calm before the storm

We complicate our lives with things to define
I threw it all away to see what was mine
Cleared out my insides, echoing hollow
I'll forever wallow, in your footsteps I follow

Warily I search for solidarity
In our disparity, your love for me was charity
This is reality, for all that it's worth
If you're not perfect then I just don't belong on this earth

And just like a disease
All the faces I see remind me of you

'Cause they seem just like you, wanna reach out, touch you
All I have is me, all I want is you, they seem just like you
Why can't I forget you all I have in me is this memory
Fading alone

I'm an array of imperfections on display
My life has been on layaway since the day you went away
I've watched myself decay, the ripe is turning rotten
Feeling nostalgic, now you're gone but not forgotten

I lack luster, what was new has turned to rust
I'm filled up with disgust, wish the world would turn to dust
It's hard to readjust 'cause now I find it strange
To trust in something that will constantly change

A long range exchange, for years I've sought you
The pain I've brought you, you've taught me what I've taught you
We can't escape ourselves or even one another
I will never recover this is love like no other

I'm gonna rip, rip you out of me
I'm fuck, fuck you out of me

Never you
Never you
Never you
Never you
They could never be you

Never be you
Never be you
They could never be
They could never be you
",All I Have Is Me
Darwin's Waiting Room,"I killed myself today
I wish I could explain
I tried to find another way to tell you how I feel it
I tried to find another way to make you proud of me

I'm numb from kneeling
This cut's too deep for healing
Revealing, there's something amiss
Something you missed

Transfer the shame
You will never be the same
I will not accept the blame
'Cause I am what you made me

It's over now
What I've seen makes me
(You gave me life but this life is mine)
Pray for things I know
(You gave me life but this life is mine)

To change me, make me a whole
(You gave me life but this life is mine)
My life's so full of shit
(You gave me life but this life is mine)
In death is where I fit

I killed myself today
I wish I could remain
I tried to find another way to let myself go free
There seems to be no other way to make things right in me

I can't awaken, my life has been forsaken
I've taken the easy way out, the only way out
Empty my wrist, we could never co-exist
I will not let this persist 'cause I am what you made me

It's over now
What I've seen makes me

Who's gonna change the world when I go

Well now you lost your son and lost control
Tell me now, how you feel
You can fucking live your life
But you can't live mine

",Another Way
Darwin's Waiting Room,"How many MC's must get dissed?
Yo, motherfucker let me speak on this
I be that lyricist, pugilist, with an educated fist
Evolutionist forced to exist on a black list

Pissed and dismissed, I resist to play the backseat
No boy from backstreet, I'm intellectually elite
My mind moves faster that Michael Johnson at a track meet
Stepping over those under me like concrete

Smaller than gnomes, shatter your thoughts like Britte Bones
Crushing feeble domes like El Nino did to mobile homes
Lamp posts get ripped apart when I envade with my tirade
Like cat in the hat during the Macy's Day parade

Worthy or an accolade instead portrayed as a charade
Conveyed as an Al Jolson with a mammy serenade
Guilty of being white and out of step like minor threat
But I'm a major threat not willing to forgive and forget

Say that shit to my face, bitch

Grimm, my pseudonym, I'm an MC not a singer
Put more dents in the game than the face of Wayne Hyzienga
Scarlet lettered, fettered as a wigger, just a wannabe
Beset with every epithet, can't get the best of me

People used to giggle and laugh not clear a path
I'm over coming obstacles like Jeremy McGrath
Those who used to raise an eyebrow, kowtow
Had no respect for you then, got no respect for you know

My spectacular vernacular suspends disbelief
You went from Verbose to Coatose, silent as the chief
Our time is brief, I hope no one forgets me
Goals to achieve before I leave like Gretzky

But I'll never retire until I see this thing through
To imbue my point of you, challenging you like K 2
My forte to foray with the words I say
So clear the way motherfucker 'cause I'm here to stay

Judge me on skills, not my color or race
Judge me on skills, not my color or race
Judge me on skills, not my color or race

",D.I.Y.M.
Darwin's Waiting Room,"Love to me was to be something
More when it came to you

Forever filling a void
Something I cannot avoid
Everytime I'm put together
I'm being destroyed

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it
I'm by myself, I'm bound to be

I can't find what I'm missing
I've lost myself, I hope that you're listening
I've seen my puzzle taken apart
It's hard to start again

But with you, all I knew was the filth
That you put me through

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories
Making them last

So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece
That I never found

And I knew it was to be
My words are quick to undress me
Filled my heart with broken glass
To make this thing last

Feels so numb when we lie together
Feels so numb when we lie together

I'm by myself, I'm bound to be
",Feel So Stupid (Table 9)
Darwin's Waiting Room,"I was once betrothed to the bonds of friends
But life too short to hold
Help me to go away

Woo-wee, wander for warmth
Cold spreads throughout my body like cancer
Consumed by a question, innately question the answer
An entrancer, traveling for truth portal to portal
To quell the parallel, heaven and hell, are we immortal?
A stepping stone of flesh and bone

A body loaned to serve our own
To atone is the undertone, don't postpone
'Cause death keeps ringing like the telephone
See, I don't know what direction I am heading
I don't know if there's something I'm forgetting

Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Help me forget I'm almost gone
Before I give in to the dark

We are forlorn hope
She doesn't stop, the torment hands me ways to make peace
With myself

You remembered me
Our memories play like motion pictures
Love was limited, pain and struggle were fixtures
I view you as I knew you, reflecting like a mirror
My eyes are the windows to your soul, becoming clearer

Without a trace of time and space
I see your face, an angel's face
You and I just can't erase
The meeting at your resting place
And now I know what direction I am headin'
Now I know you're the skin that I've been sheddin'

Before I give in to the dark
My greatest fear is bein' lost
Help me forget I'm almost gone
Before I give in to the dark

I saw you, I opened my eyes
And suddenly realized that I was to
Be engrossed in the fact that I'm already dead, you're wrong

Lost? Is this all a dream are we?
Lost? Is this all a dream are we?
Lost? Is this all a dream are we?

You can't drown and I'm as lost

Held by you to touch you

For every miracle manifested, great or small I praise You 
Yet there is one thing my heart desires 
Is to worship You each day without fail 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

For every door now opened, every pathway cleared. Lord I thank You 
For every one of my needs, You've already supplied, I praise You 
Yet there is one thing my soul longs for Is to worship You face to face 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

Beyond the veil is where I witness all Your glory 
Seated on your throne in majesty and power 
I lay prostrate before You, Oh my King 
In this place of sweet communion 
This is my earnest prayer, this is my earnest plea 
Bid me, come ye beyond the veil 

I have entered Your gates with thanksgiving 
I've entered Your courts with praise 
Yet I hear You say, Come closer Step into this Holy place 
And because the blood of Christ for me 
It continues to prevail 
Now I'm standing in Your presence, face to face

It's just a case of choosing my priorities

It's just the art of changing our perception
But when I see that girl it messes my security
So please don't leave me alone with her

She always calls me when I'm still at home
Hope I can call you while you're still at home
She always calls before I get away
Hope I can catch you before you get away

I like to read and I like to write
But you could persuade me to put the book down tonight
Just please don't ask to be a song heroine
It's not that easy just to stick you in, stick you in
Oh babe, I know you're right
But there's no time and it's not the night
I'd have to face you again and again
Although you know I'd like to stick you in, stick you in

They're all sacred songs
They're not easily won
You know the words just seem to live on
The thoughts are sacred
Though the sound is profane
But this and that you know they're
One and the same
One and the same
One and the one and the same

You never know how you're gonna end
I start out hard and I end up thin
You waste your time but you occasionally score
But you can't tell from what went down before, down before
Oh babe, do you see my point?
There's just no time and it's not the night

Although you know I'd like to stick it in, stick it in

Whatever happened to you
The one that was so beautiful
I could count on you to make my life a little brighter
I always thought you were built to last
But I never saw anything fall apart so fast

You were born in freedom
To be a slave to your inhibitions
Inventing excuses and proving the right to back up your condition
But a soul like that ain't tied too tight
And it's liable to scatter all over the night

Seasons change
Some people get old and die
Great cities are built up and torn down
But I see you're still alive
Seasons change
Some people get old and die
Great cities are built up and torn down
So how could you survive

I'm not asking for much
Only for time to stop
And history to go unrecorded
And people not to be people
People not to be people
People not to be people
People not to be people not to be

The light from your star is glowing
Yeah, I see you in the magazine
Your face seems older now, more knowing
But I prefer a woman to a teenage queen
The wine and the confusion
It's your game and you play it so cool
That night seems like an illusion
In your hotel room

German eyes, blonde disguise
Never really knew who I was talking to
But if you're supposed to be such a mystery
Why was it so easy for me to be with you
Why was it so easy for me to be with you

Too much time has come between us
And the sad words that I hear you say
Must mean you don't hold me inside you
But I guess it couldn't go any other way
That night is so far behind us
The words are changed and so is the time
I only hope that you think of me
In a hotel room

Oh those eyes, blonde disguise
Never really knew who I was talking to
But if you're supposed to be such a mystery
Why was it so easy for me to be with you
Why was it so easy for me to be with you

Too much time is wasted on the world
Too much time is wasted on you, girl
Indifferent or cold
A dragged-up scene from an old dream
Does it surprise you where those feelings can go?

Too much power is wasted on the wrong words
Too much power is wasted on the words
And if there's one thing I've learned through the years
It's how to pour my heart out without tears
Without tears

Looking for the lines
But never knowing that stream
Ley line the spring that's always flowing
Spirals up and down then reverse direction
Don't you wonder where the energy goes?

Too many secrets have been told this way
Too many secrets have been given away
But if there's one thing I've learned through the years
It's how to pour my heart out without tears
Without tears

Never wanna say what's on their mind
Go from dreams to dollars

Running down the road that they know so well
Never wanna change the order
Too quick to say that time will tell

Let it out - unravel the knots
Let it out - if you've got something to say
Let it out - get it out of the way

Why be an artful dodger
Come cool kind of fool who can slide on by
There's a whole lot of art in sadness
So make it worth your while if you're gonna cry

Let it out - unravel the knots
Let it out - if you've got something to say
Let it out - get it out of the way

Loosen up baby

Daryl Hall,"(hall)

I can't see you when I look at you
Only see you in my memory
When I find you it's just outside my sight line
Between experience and fantasy
Don't bear up to close inspection
Close inspection of the cold hard facts
Blow in and out of my life like a spirit
My eye can't see you but my mind reacts

Only a vision in the corner of my eye
Only a vision that I see out of the corner of my eye
Only a vision

Said you loved me
Heard that plain as day
I should lose this
Vision fade away
What's holding on to me
Just some state of mind
Feeling's coming on
One more time
Close inspection
I've checked this out again and again
And it won't respond to cold hard facts
Then you blow in and out of my life like a spirit
My mind knows better but my heart reacts

Only a vision in the corner of my eye
Only a vision that I see out of the corner of my eye
Only a vision girl
I wish that vision that I'm seeing was real
",Only a Vision
Daryl Hall,"(hall)

I've been trying so hard to close my eyes
Dawn is rising under those cloudy skies
Days in darkness
Seemed like they'd never end
But now the rules are changing, girl
We can begin again

And we'll be right as rain

Who's been fooling you
They've been cruel to me
The kind of love we share
Is hard for those people to see
Stormy weather
Still the chill remains
What they thought was lost forever
Has been found again

And we'll be right as rain

All those violent people
Wind up tearing our peace apart
Do their best to destroy our future
Before it has a chance to start
Never had a chance to start
The kind of love we share
It's so hard for some to see
I know it was hard for me
It ain't lost forever
It's been found again
In the rain
And it feels so good to me
",Right as Rain
Daryl Hall,"Only you could ever know
How hard it was for me to let you go
Hard to face all those nights
And suffer through all the fools advice
Seems tome it`s not so bad
to try for the kind of love that we had
Oh I need that romance
One that grows strong
When it`s got no chance 

Now you`re gone away
And I`m left to carry on
Ain`t nobody else gonna bear up to comparison
And if I can`t have the real thing
Then I`ve got to find someone
Just like you 

What you got it`s what you need
There`s pain in that but it`s plain enough to see
I know I was satisfied
But nobody else came out of my side 

I hope someone will come today
Somebody like you
Someone to take me all the way
Somebody like you
Someone to take your place
Somebody like you
Someone to fill this empty space",Someone Like You
Daryl Hall,"(hall)

I saw on the tv we're sellin' arms to the enemy
So he can blow us all down
When we charge with the cards in our hands
And men in power places are resigning
'cause even in high seats the woman is still fighting with the man
And tho I thought the time of the tough guy was just about over
Here comes another savior to stir the soldiers in the field
But what do the generals think about while the soldiers are dying
'cause the rallying cries don't reach 'em
And if they could feel they'd say

What's gonna happen to us

Does your shrink say find out who you are
Before you try to become a part of me
I'd think you'd want to anyway
She can't help you live out a middle-class fantasy
But can she talk you into leavin'
When your heart tells you to stay
Just when I thought the era of the guru was over
Here comes another savior to stir the soldiers in the field
What does the teacher care about while the student is trying
'cause your crying mind don't reach her
If she could feel she'd say

What's gonna happen to us
",What's Gonna Happen to Us
Daryl Hall,"Another day and I`m spending
Time alone
I called you place and there was
No one home
I`ve been laying low but I`m
Thinking of you
Out there by yourself trying to find
Something new
Girl I thought what we had was so
Good that I`d never hear you say no
And for all that is worth, I can`t
Think about ever letting go
But I`m lost for the words that I
Need to get over the way I feel
I can`t do it by myself
Girl I really need you her
Help me find a way to our heart
Help me find my way, I can`t see
In the dark
Tell me if I`ve drifted too far
Am I warm? Am I cold?
Tell me now, let me know
Baby where we are
I`ve asked myself a thousand times
Or more
Girl, if we don`t communicate then
What is loving for?
`Cos I thought what we had was
So good that I`d never hear you
Say why
I can`t do it by myself
Girl we`ve really got to try
Help me find a way to our heart
Help me find my way, I can`t see
In the dark
Tell me if I`ve drifted too far
Am I warm? Am I cold?
Tell me now, let me know
Baby where we are
Too much time too much confusion
Love won`t let me be

Will you catch me when I'm falling?

Works for me

You know, baby how to move me
What you give to me is elemental
Can't you see
That you take the pain from me
Only you know my fantasies
You make me realize

It's the power of seduction
It's the only way to keep me
Hanging on baby

It's the only hope, so baby do

And that's bad, you know I might

Only you, you make the senses

When did I stop loving you

When did the blue skies start to

Too far, burned too far

When did you stop loving me

Perfect day

And grew
Fed by all the love

They can see
That since we've been together

I search for words that might explain
How can a love go so deep?
Girl, it's in my blood, it'll always be a part of me

If we stay together
Or if we go our separate ways
I know, love will last forever

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
Your heart will always have a home
It is written in stone, written in stone

Seasons go by and minds have changed
But I will never doubt why I feel this way
It goes on, so strong like a solid rock
Even when the moment's gone

Nothin' last's forever
But one thing's sure to stay the same
Our love, the love is getting better

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
And I know just how the story goes
It is written in stone, written in stone

True love is timeless and unconditional
You don't need to read the writin' on the wall
I can see the future, happiness won't fade away
The sun is in the sky just like it was yesterday
Love will last forever

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
Your heart will never be alone
It is written in stone, written in stone

Got true love, it's timeless
But it'll grow through smiles and sadness
Won't you work with me?
Our love, it will be forever

If I know sometimes you might not believe it
But baby, I'll do my best to show it, let you see it
Time might not be so bad
But I know we'll come out ahead, girl

Timeless and unconditional
You don't need to read the writing on the wall
It is written in stone

It's like some light, so bright is turning on
See you standing there 
I feel a change in the air
Everywhere
Why didn't I know
That you're the one that I've been waiting for
 
(Chorus)
Yeah, there's Something About You
That I never knew
Why didn't I see your smile before
Yeah, there's Something About You
That's leaving me breathless
Leading me on
 
You can see, I can tell oh baby
You've got some power over me
Use it well
Don't know why I'm so sure
That you're the love that I've been longing for

Only matters what I feel right now
No matter what I've felt before
I'm turning to you right now
I'm breathless baby, that's all I need to know
 
Yeah, there's Something About You
Something About You",Something About You
Daryl Hall,"Tell me what world you're living in
I'm trying so hard to understand
Searching my soul just so find any line
That connects me to whatever you are hiding
Remember how we used to be
We shared the best baby, the best of everything
Now it seems like we're slowly drifting apart
Tell me when did we stop communicating
Heart to heart

Chorus:
What's in you world
What'cha trying to hide from me
I can't fight what I can't see
I need so know what's going on
What's in your world

I'm standing here with a broken heart
Trying to stop before l start
Falling all over again
Baby I need to know
Need for you to show
What's in your world
Girl I'm not ready to walk away from you
Unless you say that it's over and done, I know
I'll do what I gotta do
It's time to remind you that love's on the line
So baby say what you gotta say
But if you're gonna walk away (tell me)

[Chorus:]

Now I'm sure you understand
That a man must be a man
I've got so many promises to keep
Maybe I'm in too deep
Can't see tho other side
And baby all I want to do is satisfy
How can I give you what you need
When you're not telling me

That fire we set was never meant
Meant to shine so bright
All I know is
I can’t stand the light

To crash and burn
Fall from the sky
But I gotta keep on flying

Would be good for the temple

Fond of angling, fonder of dangling his feet in the cool brook water
While the Reverend's daughter
Sat at his side and fluttered his face with the fuzz of a dandelion.
Long about noontime
Floating 'cross the field, Georgie heard the peel of a bell being rung by the parson
Time for his lesson

As much as he hated it, the preacher was teachin' him to play the accordion.
""Don't go Georgie!"" said the Reverend's daughter
""When Daddy comes lookin' we can duck in the water.""

But the girl caught her locket on an underwater branch
And the next thing she knew, she died

I used to wake up every day
Thinkin' back
On what I should've said

In a rifle full of rust
And the holding of it
Had to turn my hands red

Thought I'd never
Cross my heart with another
Up until the time
I met you yesterday
Then oh my, I thought I would die
But I'm back in love again

Forget about the time
And the faith I left behind
Sad to say my luck went wrong
I made a plan
For a castle made from sand
But you can't build close
To where the tide comes rollin'

Cross my heart with another

With a handmade highway
For a friend
Well, Dave figured
We were due to see a town
He thought he saw some smoke
Drift round the bend

It was ten o'clock
When the Mohawks hit
And the fun had just begun
They tied a friend of mine
With binder twine
And left him to dry in the sun

Well, Dave droped first
With an arrow in the head
And his horse Smiley she fell screamin'

And the ceiling's fallin' in
And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter

I've got to move myself out to the country
I'm lookin' out for any place at all
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia

A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope
Say, the stolen bikes are gathering by the thousands
Along with seven million people without a hope

I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall

Settling down the evening with the hills
I'm kicking stones and walking all alone like a modern buried treasure
And it's all around and waiting there for free

If that's what makes you happy
Then I'd love to sing my song
And if it strikes your ear
Won't you sing along

Coming on the flow in the field that no one's ever run through
Sipping from a stream beneath the stars
And breaking bread and rolling up your bed then hiding from the thunder
And though the sky may cry you know it's just another song

If that's what makes you happy
Then I'd love to sing my song
And if it strikes your ear

And if it strikes your ear

Dragging down some funny little sound
And then when you're on your own and you're far from home
You find a smile on every corner
So if you're feeling down just turn around and sing

And if it strikes your ear
Won't you sing along

It's so hard for me to keep them
And if I put them down into this book
It might be easier to sleep then
And there's a lot of tunes that'll never be sung
Because the faith and rules and changes

And now I'm singing one last song
In honor of a lady who could turn my head around
And I'm thinking about her
A whoa and I'm thinking about her

Well Caroline came and then she went
We just couldn't get together
And then I tried a lot of different scenes
I couldn't find anything better
All my troubles made me think of a time
When I had a woman named Pauline
And now I'm singing one last song

A wha and I'm thinking about her

You can pull it all out of a makeup case
While your mans in the parlor waiting
I believe I found the perfect girl

Well just look into my eyes
And know the times we'll change

I know it's here
I want to see it come to life before my eyes
Don't hold back your love

And if you think there is no place to run
Just hold onto my hand

On some road to somewhere
Can I be the one

Taught to be modern little boys and girls

You know what's true?

Before he passed out on his bed
Here's looking at you kid
And the rocky road ahead

Heavy rain, lightning too
Heavy rain when I'm with you
You know the thunder comes like a lion's roar
But it leaves me now
When you walk out the door
Listen to that northern wind
It's singing a sad old song
A melody so sick and tired
Been blowing much too long
Ain't it time to feel the weather change
You know it's overdue

When you walk in an open space
Tell me who, tell me why

Only love can make me happy
Only love can make me cry
Only love can sanctify me
If you can doubt it can you tell me why

When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door.

Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand,
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand.
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall.
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall.

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today.
We're so close, so close, yet so far away.

That's what you need to solve all the mysteries.
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun,
She says ""I don't want to be wise, I just want to stay young"".

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today.
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight.
There's a secret hurt in my heart.
And the dream that pulls us together girl,
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight,
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here.
We gotta fight to keep it together girl,
For the dream, that keeps us,

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slams on the plans you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know who could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart

That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust
His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on ""this man's army""
They were old and crusty

She was twenty when the diner was a baby
He was the dishwasher, busy in the back, his hands covered with
Gravy
Hair black and wavy
Brilliantine slick, a pot - cleaning dandy
He was young and randy

Day to day, to day today
Then they were old, their lives wasted away
Month to month, year to year
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall

They sat together in the empty diner
Filled with cracked china
Old news was blowing across the filthy floor
And the sign on the door read ""this way out"", that's all it read
That's all it said

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"He's the star on the stage, but he screams all night
'Cause he can't get to sleep at all
And his favorite book, by the T.V. Light
Can't stop this matinee, he's played it over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

All those hard earned words, that he's fought from his pen
Have been forgotten in some empty hall
And those wide eyed looks, on those wiped out faces
Make some dreams of their places over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Wouldn't believe in years
If he told you what the papers use to say
But that was in his hey day

Get back in his prime he had the fans in line
You should have seen him then
Now look at him

His hair is getting thin
There's one last show before the glory ends
There in the wings, waits his only friend
The record that he's prayed to over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Now, he can't stop the music, oh no
Then we go like this, and we go like that
Music
Then we go like this, and we go like that
Can't stop the music

Then we go like this, and we go like that
Music
Then we go like this and we go like that
Can't stop the music

Then we go like this, and we go like that
Music
Then we go like this, and we go like that
Can't stop the music

Then we go like this, and we go like that
Music
Then we go like this and we go like that

Now don't you go looking at me like that
You might see I'm ashamed, what's your name
Talk with me, won't you talk with me

Oh pretty girl
It ain't too hip faking lines you ain't taking
But your lips make me say it that way
Now there's no use you resisting
This is the Cradle Thief insisting
I think you better let me have it my way

Fool around with me, come on mess around with me

Will you survive, learn to drive
I know you can't describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
I'm not playing around, can't you tell the way I'm squeezing
Your hand

I'm just a kid don't make me feel like a man
Silly girl I'm just playing
Now did you think that I'd be nuts enough to try an' pick you up
Don't you know it's a game, it's all a game I've been playing

But what'd you say your name was,
Walk with me, just around the corner baby maybe you could even

It's uncanny, the way you always call
Every time I think about you
It's uncanny baby, the way you always know
Just what I'm going through
Sometimes you take me by surprise
And I don't know what to say
When I'm not alone
You always find me where I lay
When you call my name and take my breath away
It's uncanny baby, it's uncanny baby
Please don't you know

When I was lonely, you were my friend
When I needed you, you took me in girl
When I was crazy, you bring me back home
When I see you, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love again
It's hard to talk about all the trouble that I feel
And I can't always see what's fantasy
What's real
But when you call my name
The wave disappears
It's uncanny baby, uncanny baby
You keep on doin' it girl

You do it to me, you do it to me
When I think about you don't you know
I hear that doorbell ringing in my ear
You do it to me, you do it to me
Your love's so good and interesting
Shows no sign of ending
Just keeps on taking me higher
Uncanny baby, uncanny baby, please girl
Uncanny baby, you know it's uncanny
You know it's uncanny now
Every time, every time I think about you
You know it's uncanny
Oh you always come through girl
You know it's uncanny, you know it's uncanny baby
Keep on doin' it girl
You know it's uncanny

Don't need no truth in disguise
She only goes by
That look of love in her eye
There ain't no other side to see
She plays it so easily
And I gotta love her -ah-
When she shows it to me

Oh the woman comes and goes
When the morning comes she goes
Yeah the woman comes
And goes when she's satisfied

I might not see her for days
Then she bumps in, in a haze
I like how her mind works
And I love how it plays
She gets her kick and she leaves
And leaves me weak in the knees

A lot of sweet memories
I like it. I love it

So why can't we follow through

What we believe has got to be more than the words of our friends
Honey I love the life but I'd fight for our world not to end
Green flag is rising and baby green means go
There's something on the horizon
And who deserves to know more than you
More than me
All of us
Can't you see

Everywhere I look I see people waking up
So why are we still sleeping
Everywhere I look I see people shaking off all the old ways
So why can't we follow through",Everywhere I Look
Daryl Hall & John Oates,"You push my buttons hard
And don't even realize what you're doing is killing my soul
Do you think I'm just some prize
You can win and then discard after the thrill is gone?
Well, listen then

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna take it this time
I ain't gonna take that from anyone
I ain't gonna take it this time
Guess I'm gonna break out

You know I try to please
I lay awake at night
Trying to find the words you'll understand
But when I'm nothing but sincere
I know you can't be hearing
Cause you say it's more of the same
Well, listen then

[Chorus]

Do you think I'd ever try to fool you
There are enough lies in the world
You don't need mine
If I can't win your heart and move you
You must be blind",I Ain't Gonna Take It This Time
Daryl Hall & John Oates,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym,
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him.
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved cross the floor,
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door.

Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand,
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand.
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall.
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall.

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today.
We're so close, so close, yet so far away.

Some people think, if you really believe,
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries.
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun,
She says ""I don't want to be wise, I just want to stay young"".

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today.
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight.
There's a secret hurt in my heart.
And the dream that pulls us together girl,
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight,
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here.
We gotta fight to keep it together girl,
For the dream, that keeps us,

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
Who would of thought girl that we'll end up this way.
Getting' so close, so close,
So far away.

We're living in a dream world.
Yet we're livin' today girl.
Just you and me baby.

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"Only you could ever know
How hard it was for me to let you go
Hard to face all those nights
And suffer through all the fools advice

Seems tome it's not so bad
To try for the kind of love that we had
Oh I need that romance
One that grows strong

When it's got no chance
Now you're gone away
And I'm left to carry on
Ain't nobody else gonna bear up to comparison

And if I can't have the real thing
Then I've got to find someone
Just like you
What you got it's what you need

There's pain in that but it's plain enough to see
I know I was satisfied
But nobody else came out of my side
I hope someone will come today

Someone to take me all the way
Somebody like you
Someone to take your place

But we're gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be rough, on us

That's why it hurt so bad
It set us back a thousand years
We're gonna make it up
Though it's gonna be rough
To erase all the hurt and tears

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But i pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
But we both know that we can make it

We gotta take life as it comes
And never worry about who's right or wrong
It's an uphill climb
To the finish line
We're gonna try to make it

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Never an honest word

What'll you do what would you say
Strange moods and jealous anger
A kind of passion that I can't explain
You're high strung, that's attraction
But your act is driving me away

Please don't make me play'em no

You gotta give me something to hold
That cute routine you got is wearing thin
So baby can you do it for yourself and for me
I don't wanna lose you, I want us to win

You're high strung that's a fact
But don't you let it drive me away

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"Please return, come back, I've been saving your place
Too much time has elapsed, unreality, memory erases
And the rules and the rights and the wrongs don't apply
Far apart, so together is destiny weeded to fate

Now, I write the script, you direct my dreams
We're along on the beach for the passionate scene
And it's a drag to wake up with you, saying to me

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me
One night out and I'm looking for trouble and finding it's easy
You know we all make mistakes and we all need the touch of a hand
In the right kind of place, in a time of need

I could pick up the phone, but the talk ain't cheap
I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And I wait for the day I hear you saying to me

I say baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

And in my dreams I hear you saying to me
Saying baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?

Music by Daryl Hall)

You and I have separate lives girl
You and I go different ways on roads that cross
When love and loss is ruled by fate
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

I'll try to find a way to encourage you
It's easy to convince myself
Cause I can't believe you'd wanna be with somebody else
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you



",I Don't Wanna Lose You
Daryl Hall & John Oates,"You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Money love or power
When you want to have the number one first run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

You ought to know better than that
The more that you buy the less you get back
It's a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme

The compulsion to count the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
And all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
You can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

Don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take the less you give back
Just a taste of possession obsession
Brings a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme
",Possession Obsession
Daryl Hall & John Oates,"You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your finger tips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)

You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone gone gone oh oh oh

There's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl you're starting to criticize little things I do
Ooh, it makes me just feel like crying (baby)
'Cause baby something beautiful's dying

There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity of the moment?

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought
We were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid that I gotta laugh
And the other thing is I really thought
That we were special

Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way?

As if I were above me

Using the bodies up as we go
Waking up to fantasy

And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around

Looking for a love where the climate is cold

You rely on ""the kid"" `cause there's nobody waiting around
If you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
I know when it's coming
(I thought so anyway)
Some things stay the some and some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down
But you turned `em around
 You did you did it you did it you Did it in a minute
 it didn't take long
Well I still can't say I know
When a love is real or touch and go
And if two can be one, who is the one two becomes
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me

What can I say
I don´t feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, no, I know that I´m right
I´m just better off not listening to friends´ advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can´t resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, ´cause it means more tome
Sometimes I forget what I´m doing, I don´t forget what I want
Regret what I´ve done, regret you? I couldn´t go on

And if you insist on knowing my bliss
I´ll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I´ll only smile when I lie, then I´ll tell you this

He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far I just might""

As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night

He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man

Is I know you're missing me
The way I'm missing you
I guess that you ain't sleeping and the company you're keeping

Time will heal it, that's what they say
But I can't help but wish tomorrow was today

And there's no two ways about it
When you're in you just can't doubt it
Doing heartbreak time

And though I keep believing
It's my heart that I'm deceiving
Doing heartbreak time

Maybe I'm just pretending but I see a happy ending
Well I guess that's just like me
A fool in love you see
I can still recall the day, you said that you'd be mine to stay

When the world is turned turning in on you
Oh and I (oh and I) show us what to do (what to do what to do)

Why is love so complicated

Say it isn't so

Like on the radio
And if I could I'd write that song for you 

If a song could make you cry
If a song could make you say goodbye
Could it change you mind
If a song could make you stay
It's a backward chain reaction
It's a lack of satisfaction
That makes our love breakdown
To the little things, the little things

'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say, money,
Money won't get you too far, get you too far

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy
To hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause it's too much to give
'Cause you'd rather live for the thrill of it all

Oh you're a rich girl and you've gone too far

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"90 miles outside Chicago
Can't stop driving I don't know why
So many questions I need some answers
2 years later you're still on my mind
Whatever happened to the Uptown theater?
Yeah it held the stars up in the sky
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
Did the captain of the Titanic cry
Someday we'll know
Why love can't move mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't there for you
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries
I'm speeding by the place where I met you
For the 97th time
(Chorus)
Someday we'll know
Why love can't move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't there for you
Someday we'll know
If love is do or die for
Someday we'll know
Why it died so soon
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't there for you
I bought a ticket back to where I came from
I watched my past crash in the sea
If I could ask you just one question
Why aren't you here with me?

Stretch their brains a lot
To play their way to immortality
Some of them are very smart
And trying awfully hard
To make their mark and last eternally
Seems there ain't no people
Dumb enough to see

The sky is full of hawks
Who say that money talks
And only the rich are really free
They tell you that the fact of life
Is that you have to fight
For every cold hard coin that you can see
Well, there ain't no money
Soft enough for me

Now there is a mountain
It's big and it's wide
And nobody knows
What's on the other side
Oh, some people are curious
And some are afraid
But they're goin' over that mountain
Any old way

Over the mountain
Over the mountain
Over the mountain
Over the mountain

Sometimes it rains
And sometimes it shines
The mountain she's sitting there
All of the time
It's handsome as Jesus
And ugly as sin
You can stand on the outside
But you can't get in

Who did as he pleased
He didn't want to be like you
And he didn't want to be like me

When you walk through the door
Love all over again, even more than before

As we move through the room
Now you're here in my arms,
Holding on, kissing you

Sometimes I wonder, if you were through with me
When the whole party ended

Now you're here in my arms,
Holding on, kissing you

The way we parted was something to see
I'd never treat love like you've treated me
It only took one look to bring my heart around
Floating in my mind
I heard that sweat sound pull me down
Rush in, rush in
Like I'm dreaming

And his heart beat like thunder when they moved 'cross the floor

Why she's sad when she stares at the ring on her hand

And the dream that pulls us together, girl
Is a dream, is a dream that keeps us so close
Yet so far away

But that's all you need to solve all the mysteries
Well, I know someone, who just heads for the sun

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
You must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go through me,
But I don't know why.

I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said,
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.",In Too Deep
Daryl Stuermer,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
Burning into the night.

Too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round

Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

Superman where are you now
Everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Are losing control by the hour.

This is the time
This is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

I remember long ago 
When the sun was shining
The stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago 

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep.

What he's waiting for, I don't know.
But he waits every day now.
He's just waiting for something to show.

And nobody knows him, and nobody cares,
Cause there's no hidin' place,
There's no hidin' place

Lookin' everywhere at no one,
He sees everything and nothing at all, oh.
When he shouts, nobody listens,

So we carry on, down the road
And we live our lives haunted by
All the things we say and do
Keep on missing, when I'm alone with you

No there's never a time to change
You don't get a chance to rearrange
It's a long, long way to go
Just to find out something, we both know
Can't you see what's going on
It's so sad, that a love so strong, has gone

All I know is what is true
All I ask is for you to
Just look around and see

You live your life locked in a dream

Where nothing is real, and not what it seems
We can't go on another day
Just being afraid to say

It's a long long way to fall
When we both thought we had it all
Well you know it's the time to say
Cause we're all played out, we've lost our way
Oh, I'd hoped that you would
Be oh so understanding

Daryl Stuermer,"The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
?Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And new my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes

He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go,
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same

Daryl Stuermer,"Need I say I love you
Need I say I care
Need I say that emotion's,
Something we don't share
I don't want to be sitting here
Trying to deceive you
Cos you know I know baby
I don't wanna go.

We cannot live together
We cannot live apart
That's the situation
I've known it from the start
Every time that I look at you
I can see the future
Cos you know I know baby
I don't wanna go.

Throwing it all away

Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turning upside down
You're throwing it all away.

Who'll light up the darkness
Who will hold your hand
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand
Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you
Cos you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go.

Some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be
Late at night when you call my name

Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling after me.

That wrote the  words that broke the  heart
Of the  one the only  one that really  loves her

With  one stoke of the pen
She  wrote off all my  dreams
Erasing all those  plans we made together
There's no one that  I can blame

But  how my world was changed
By the  hand that held the  pen
That wrote the  words that broke the  heart
Of the  one the only  one that really loves her
I,am the  one the only one that really loves  her",The Note
Daryle Singletary,"You said, what you had to say, would come as a surprise
You were right, honey, you were right
You told me, nothing I could do was gonna change your mind
I knew then, you'd be right again

But, when you said we were through, I knew that wasn't true

[Chorus]
That's where you're wrong, that's where you're wrong
Deep down inside love lingers on, it won't let go, it's still too strong
That's where you're wrong

I tell myself, I have to learn to leave the past behind
Looking back, I'm sure of that
I say, I'd be much better off, without you on my mind
Girl, it's true but what can I do

When I think these thoughts will end, my heart says, think again

Daryle Singletary,"Six foot six he stood on the ground
Weighed two hundred and thirty five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him cryin' like a little whipped pup because of love

You can't see it with your eyes hold it in your hand
But like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man this thing called love
It can lift you up it can let you down take your world turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
[ guitar ]
Most men are like me they struggle in doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a thing called love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her brest
I thank God that this world's been blessed with a word called love

You can't see it with your eyes...
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love ",A Thing Called Love
Daryle Singletary,"On a park bench the old man
Sat and stared into yesterday
I sat down beside him and said
""Thank God for this quite place
Between the wife and the kids, the TV and the phone
It seems there's something always goin' on""
He said, ""Son, if you think this is quite
You should follow me home""

'Til you've lived in a house by yourself
When silence is all you've got left
In the rooms where your babies have slept
So don't wish for something you will regret
'Cause you ain't heard nothin' yet
The old man kept talkin'
Painting pictures from his memories
Did he drag out his past for himself
Or was it for me
His eyes came alive, he spoke of dancing with his wife
And playing ball with his two little boys
He said, ""Son, what I hear is music, you're callin' noise""
'Cause you ain't heard nothin' yet
'Til you've lived in a house by yourself
When silence is all you've got left
In the rooms where your babies have slept

There's songs and poems and promises of dreams that might come true

Daryle Singletary,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
A man killed 'neath the town hall light.
There were few at the scene and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me.
Well, the judge said, ""Son what is your alibi ?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die.""
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife.
She walks these hills in a long black veil.
She visits my grave where the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.
Well, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear.
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil, Lord, she cries all o'er my bones.
She walks these hills in a long black veil.
And visits my grave when the night winds wail.
Nobody knows, nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.
Nobody knows, nobody sees,
Nobody knows but me.",Long Black Veil
Daryle Singletary,"In down town Medesto, I was working the Holiday Inn
I was set with a gig that would last us through the weekend
I was singing a new song I wrote on the way into town
When she came in the front door and found her a place to sit down

I knew right away she liked the words to my song
'Cause she stared at my big guitar, followed my fingers too long
And she had the likeness of a girl, I'd seen in a dream
But lights can do wonders with makeup and faded blue jeans

And the last thing, I needed was somebody messing up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for turning around one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at being a big singing star

With one passing glance I could tell she was young for her age
'Cause she got to looking better as she got down closer to the stage
And as she sipped on her wine I could tell just the kind she would be
And somehow, I knew she was here to do bad things to me

And the last thing, I needed was somebody messing up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for turning around one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at being a big singing star

She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at being a big singing star
And blow all my chances at being a country music star

Singing them sadder than a one car funeral nobody sings like Jones

I'd take that old kitchen broom up to my room and I'd play it like an old guitar
Or sit out on the porch trying to sing like George dreaming of becoming a star
Well things I never did when I was just a kid made what I am today
See momma used to whoop me with a George Jones album that's why I sing this way

So I ended up in Nashville working at a saw mill just to be close to the stars
I got a little broke but I couldn't ask my folks so I had to hock my old guitar
