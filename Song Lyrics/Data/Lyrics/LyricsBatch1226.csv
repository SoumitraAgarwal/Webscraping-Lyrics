The Jazz Butcher,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow

The Jazz Entertainers,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

The Jazz Epistles,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The Jazz Epistles,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

The Jazz June,"The proper understanding
of the situation
that's been called upon
There are two equal pieces
Dictated by the grains of sand
Watch the scales tip
and they fall like water
the cycle spins around the nail in the middle to stay afloat
The center holds the weight and seems to fit
Life spins in the middle
set the other side on digging heels
somewhere in the middle
The center of focus
distinguished in each direction
A tunnel visionary spears to rights and lefts
Weights in motion are equally fixed at both ends
While the sound leaps in waves around the middle
tied tight to the nail of all things falling apart
pinned between the equals of today and yesterday
running out off all sides and returning to the center
where it should be ",Balance
The Jazz June,"Speaking the worlds worth of insignificance
Guess I should have left left-alone unsaid
'Cause it's been cold
Cold as forever
On this forever afternoon
When a pink drop is already too loud
Charcoal has erased the ceiling
I guess the burn has settled somewhere past the city

Lights they burn in fever yellows
Guess I should have left the questions left unsaid
The medicines a simple answer to rely on
So I fucked up but I'm getting on with my life
It feels like there's a point to everything
The summer holds the nails to kill the questions
when I'm beating paper with ink",The Medicine
The Jazz Poets Trio,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,

Some others I've seen might never be mean

Didn't Pharaoh's army get (hut!) drownded? Oh, Mary, don't you weep.

Told me I was born early in the morn.

It was early in the day when I set out to roam. Went to seek my fortune far away from home.
I set out to roam far away from home.

But today when I awoke I missed my darlin' so. Gotta have her by my side forever more I know.
Need my darlin' so. Evermore I know.

The Kingston Trio,"He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man, not the kind to kill
But a jealous fight and a flashing blade
Sent him on the run to the Everglades
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades

Now, the posse went in and they came back out
They said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye so the debt is paid
He won't last long in the Everglades
A man can't live in the Everglades

Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the bayin' hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the 'skeeters don't get him then the 'gaters will

Now, the years went by and his girl was wed
His fam'ly gave him up for dead
But now and then the natives would say
They'd seen him runnin' through the Everglades
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades

Now, he never heard the news on the radio
He was deep in the 'glades so he'll never know
His runnin' and hidin' didn't make much sense
For the jury had ruled it was self-defense
Running like a dog through the Everglades

Where a man can hide and never be found
And have no fear of the bayin' hounds
But he better keep movin' and don't stand still
If the 'skeeters don't get him then the 'gaters will
Runnin' like a dog through the Everglades
Skippin' like a frog through the slimy bog

Talkin' with my comrades to pass the time away
Lying in the shade underneath the trees
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas

Peas, peas, peas, peas, eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas, eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas

Just before the battle, the General heard a row
He said, ""The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now""
He turned around in wonder and what do you think he sees?
The Georgia militia eating goober peas

Peas, peas, peas, peas, eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas, eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas

Think my song has lasted almost long enough
The subject is most interesting but rhymes are mighty rough
I wish this war was over, when free from rags and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts and then we'd gobble goober peas

The Kingston Trio,"Way out by lonely bayou. 
There waits a girl where the green grasses grow.
Waits she there with a tear in her eye dreaming of years that long have gone by.

How I yearn for the days that are gone! 
I'd wake in the morning to a whippoorwill song.
There by the fire sits my lady fair. 
Singing this song as the combs her long hair.

Now I'm thinkin' home I must go cause I've been wandrin' where the four winds blow.
Startin' tonight with the big April moon, she'll be by my side by the third day of June.

Todos le daremos nuestra voluntad, pues a se iqualar con nosotros viniera.

It was a very good year,
It was a very good year
For small town girls
And soft summer nights.
We'd hide from the lights

When I was twenty-one,
It was a very good year,
It was a very good year
For city girls who lived up the stair,
With perfumed hair
That came undone,
When I was twenty-one.

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year,
It was a very good year
For blue blooded girls
Of independent means.
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five.

But now the days are short,
I'm in the autumn of the year,
And now I think of my life as
Vintage wine from the old kegs,
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear;
It was a very good year.",It Was a Very Good Year

As I was sitting with a jug and spoon, one Sunday morning in the month of June.
A birdie sang in an ivy bunch and the song he sang was the jug of punch.

Chorus:
Tura lura lu, tura lura lu, tura lura lu, tura lura lu.

A birdie sang in an ivy bunch and the song he sang was the jug of punch.

What more diversion can a man desire than to court a girl by a cheerful fire?
A carey pippin to crack and crunch and on the table a jug of punch.

A carey pippin to crack and crunch and on the table a jug of punch.

Ye mortal lords, drink your nectar wine and ye quality folk, sip your claret fine.
I'd give them all the grapes in the bunch for a jolly pull at my jug of punch.

(Chorus)

I'd give them all the grapes in the bunch for a jolly pull at my jug of punch.

Ye learned doctors, with all your art, cannot cure a depression on the heart.
But even a cripple forgets his hunch when he's snug outside of a jug of punch.

(Chorus)

But even a cripple forgets his hunch when he's snug outside of a jug of punch.

And when I'm dead and I'm in my grave, no costly tombstone do I ever crave.
Just lay me down in my native peat with a jug of punch at my head and feet.

Love likes to fly by night so let it fly, dear and when it's over bid me goodbye, dear.

In the course of our nation's history the people of Boston have rallied bravely whenever the rights of men have been threatened
Today a new crisis has arisen
The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known as the M.T.A.
Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in the form of a subway fare increase
Citizens, hear me out, this could happen to you!

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie
On a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
Went to ride on the MTA

Well, did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (what a pity)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there the conductor told him, ""one more nickel""
Charlie couldn't get off of that train!

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (poor old Charlie)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station
Crying, ""what will become of me?
How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea
Or my cousin in Roxbury?""

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (shame and scandal)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station
Every day at quarter past two
And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
As the train comes rumbling through!

But did he ever return?
No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (he may ride forever)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned
Pick it Davey

Kinda hurts my figers

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian
Get poor Charlie off the MTA!

Or else he'll never return
No he'll never return and his fate is still unlearned (just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston
He's the man who never returned

He's the man who never returned
He's the man who never returned

Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away, I know not where

Sweetest little gal that you ever did see
Works all day in a cotton mill
She makes her gin in a bathtub still

Well here we go 'round again

Pretty little thing names Sally Brown
Travels around on a riverboat
Shares her room with a Billy goat

Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away, I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Spending my money, gonna drink it away
I'll start saving on another day
Wasting my time in the silver dollar
Pinch them girls just to hear them holler

The Kingston Trio,"I met a nice old man today, oh, yes, oh, and he sure had a lot to say, a good long time ago.
I've led a soldier's occupation, oh, yes, oh, in every part of this big nation, a good long time ago.
I've seen the world and roamed its placed, oh, yes, oh. I guess I've been in a million places, a good long time ago.
But there are times when soldiering gets lonely, you long for friendly company.
So when you find an unfamiliar city, here's advice that always worked for me.
When your train gets into town, oh, yes, oh, just make a bee line to the pound, a good long time ago.
Don't just wander helter-skelter, oh, yes, oh, seek the nearest animal shelter, a good long time ago.
You soon will find the truest of companions. A little dog can melt a heart of stone.
Just when you think you're up a dreary canyon, a puppy's love can bring you close to home.
Find a store and buy some twine, oh, yes, oh. Now tie the doggie to the line, a good long time ago.
Thus prepared for any weather, oh, yes, oh. Dog and man will stand together, a good long time ago.
For mothers warn their daughters of the dangers of soldiers in their quest for girls.
Never, never speak to strangers unless their from the canine world.
A sweet young maid in passing by, oh, yes, oh, saw my smile but made no reply, a good long time ago.
The puppy fixed his gaze upon her, oh, yes, oh, two steps more and she was a goner, a good long time ago.
The sands of time have swept away the heart aches, the tears, the parting, and the pain.
The pup I gave her for a keep sake will always remind me of what's her name (what's her name?)","Oh, Yes, Oh!"
The Kingston Trio,"Chorus:
Ole, oleanna. Ole, oleanna. Ole, ole, ole, ole, ole, oleanna.

Climbing up the Matterhorn, all alone as I could be, I reached the top, I paused to stop and heard this mystic melody.
(Chorus)

On an island in the ocean, not a human soul around, as I searched for bread and water, once again I heard this sound.
(Chorus)

My plane had all its motors gone. The wings would never keep me up.
I heard a voice that seemed to say, 'Now, let's take it from the top.'
(Chorus)

I was tramping through the Congo when the Mau-Mau tribe appeared
And their native chant was haunting, just the sound that I had feared.
(Chorus)

While rocketing one day in space, I found myself upon the moon. An ectoplasm greeted me with, 'Have you heard the latest tune?'
(Chorus)

My ship was sinking in the water, so I sent an S.O.S. and I waited for an answer, you don't even have to guess.
Came a voice so calm and cheerful, just as cheerful as can be, said, 'According to our survey, now the song is number three!'

The Kingston Trio,"It's a mighty hard road that my poor hands have hoed. My poor feet have traveled a hot, dusty road.
Out of your dust bowls and westward we rode. Your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold.
I've wandered all over this green growing land. Wherever your crops were, I've lent you my hands.
On the edge of your city you'll see me and then, I come with the dust and I go with the wind.

California, Arizona, I've worked all your crops. Then it's North up to Oregon to gather your hops.
Dig the beets from your ground. Cut the grapes from your vines to set on your table that light sparkling wine.

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground from the Grand Coulee dam where the waters run down
Every state in the Union this migrant has been. I come with the dust and I go with the wind.
It's always we ramble that river and I all along your green valley, I'll work 'til I die.
And I'll travel this road until death sets me free for my pastures of plenty must always be green.

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. (Repeat) So, as far as I can see, I guess I was meant to be just a rollin' stone.

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. A rollin' stone hasn't a boss.
Just like a Spring or a Summer's breeze, I can roll just where I please. I'm just a rollin' stone.

Can't lose my way, all directions are the same when I'm a-travelin'. I've got no home, sweet home.
Just keep boppin', never stoppin', couldn't even if I wanted to, I've got to roam and roll.

A rollin' stone gathers no moss. A rollin' stone's like that coin that you toss.
But I don't need level ground. I can roll up hill or down. I'm just a rollin' stone.

When I'm travelin', all directions are the same. A string unravelin', I don't think that I'm to blame.

Some might think my life's a loss. A rollin' stone never gets lost.
So, I'll just keep playin' it straight 'til I roll right through that gate. I'm just a rollin' stone.
A rollin' stone. (Repeat and fade)

Chorus:
Ruby red were her lips. Diamond pure was her heart. Emerald green (emerald green) were her eyes.
A priceless gem of perfection, but I lost her 'neath the sapphire sky. Ruby red, ruby red, ruby red.

I'd cross the wide Pacific and swim the China sea to have those lips of ruby red back here again with me.
Ruby red, ruby red, to have those lips of ruby red back here, again, with me.

I thought I could forget, so I sailed away, but I lived to regret until this very day.
Ruby red, ruby red, to have those lips of ruby red back here, again, with me.

Not one ribbon for her hair.

In gay profusion lying there,

Wassail, wassail, all over the town. The cup, it is white and the ale, it is brown.
The cup, it is made of the good ashen tree and so is the malt of the finest barley.

Oh, master and missus, are you all within? Pray open the door and let us come in.
Oh, master and missus who sit by the fire, pray think of the trav'lers who walk through the mire.

Oh, where is the maid with the silver hair pin to open the door and let us come in?
Oh, master and missus, it is our desire, a good loaf and cheese and a toast by the fire.

There was an old man and he had an old cow and how for to keep her, he didn't know how.
He built up a barn for to keep his cow warm and a drop of good cider will do us no harm.

The girt dog of Langport, he burnt his long tail and this is the night we go singing wassail.
Oh, master and missus, now we must be gone. Bless all in this house until we come again.
Bless all in this house 'till we come again!

That the North wind is chilly and cold

Had a little girl but she left me, well, I know

She took the sun and left me the rain
And left me the sorrow and all of the pain
Well, I know, she took my love and left me torn
Now, I'm lonely and forlorn, well, I know

All of my love done left me
All of my love done left me, well, I know

She told me someday she'd return
If the sun should freeze or the earth should burn

I started on a journey about a year ago to a little town called Morrow in the State of Ohio.
I've never been much of a traveler, and I really didn't know that Morrow was the hardest place I'd ever try to go.

So I went down to the station for my ticket and applied for tips regarding Morrow not expecting to beguiled.
Said I, ""My friend, I'd like to go to Morrow and return no later than tomorrow for I haven't time to burn.""

Said he to me, ""Now let me see if I have heard you right. You'd like to go to Morrow and return tomorrow night.
You should have gone to Morrow yesterday and back today for the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way.

If you had gone to Morrow yesterday now don't you see, you could have gone to Morrow and returned today at three
For the train today to Morrow, if the schedule is right, today it goes to Morrow and returns tomorrow night.""

Said I, ""My friend, it seems to me you're talking through your hat. There is a town named Morrow on the line now tell me that.""
""There is,"" said he, ""but take me a quiet little tip. To go from here to Morrow is a fourteen hour trip.

The train today to Morrow leaves today at eight thirty-five. At half-past ten tomorrow is the time it should arrive.
So if from here to Morrow is a fourteen hour jump, can you go today to Morrow and get back today, you chump?""

Said I, ""I'd like to go to Morrow so can I go today and get to Morrow by tonight if there is no delay?""
""Well, well,"" said he to me, ""and I've got no more to say. CAN YOU GET anywhere tomorrow and get back again today?""

Said I, ""I guess you know it all but kindly let me say, how can I get to Morrow if I leave this town today?""
Said he, ""You cannot go to Morrow any more today 'cause the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way.""

I was so disappointed. I was mad enough to swear. The train had gone to Morrow and had left me standing there.
HE HAD NO RIGHT in telling me that I was a-howling jay. I could not go to Morrow so I guess in town I'll stay.",To Morrow
