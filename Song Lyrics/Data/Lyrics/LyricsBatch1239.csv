The S.O.S. Band,"Hours pass
The weeks turn into months
And I'm still alone
Wondering when I'll see you

Still I watch the hourglass
The symbol of our love
When we were so sure
Our love would be everlasting

What changed your mind
We are the sands of time
Only sands of time
Don't ever run out on me

Time is loneliness
When you're not around
But I continue
Turnin' the hourglass upside till I see you

And whatever life brings my way
I'm always gonna know one thing
With you I'll always share all my love
Nothing can change it because we're bound by the sands of time

I won't change my mind
(No, I won't)
We are the sands of time

Only sands of time
(Ooh, baby)
Don't ever run out on me

Thought time had run out
I almost hope
(No, don't)

It's hard to keep the faith
Oh, but if you believe
You can make almost anything you ever want come true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

And I'll wait for you, baby
(You know I want you, baby)
And if we believe, it will only come true
(Mmm, mmm)

I won't change my mind
(It's so lonely when you're not around)
We are the sands of time
(Turn the hourglass upside down)

Only sands of time
(We won't ever, never, never)
Don't ever run out on me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)

I won't change my mind
(Oh, oh, oh)
We are the sands of time
(Bound by the sand of time)

Only sands of time
(The sands of time)
Don't ever run out on me

Believe we always come together in the sands of time

The S.O.S. Band,"You've got me like no one has before, I really love you 
The way you talk and the things you say sound so good 
But there you were standing over there with another last night 
Now in the middle of it can't you see it's killin' me 

I had high hopes for you and me 
Thought we'd stay together eternally

The Sadies,"No I'd rather go and journey 
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That break the sight up into colors
That no one know the names of

And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and gentle waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know

Now the dark finds you in your room
And another day will be all too soon

By the sweet crystal mine and all
That she's waiting for is the moon
Which does burn me too

Of the grass near the mine
Don't disturb what is growing

sending signals to our homes from outer space

I do refuse to yield.

And get this body fed.

With the rain right on my heels.

The San Remo Golden Strings,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

That's when my love comes tumbling down

And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour

I'm gonna take you in my arms and hold you

And when I spoke her name
And held her near me
She couldn't hear me

The Sandpipers,"A gift of song is a gift of love,
Though how this is I cannot say.
But who receives a gift of love,
Must send it freely on its way
As I receive, so let me give,
And live in joy my whole life through

A gift of song, is a gift of love
Here comes a gift of love for you

A gift of song is a gift of love
It falls to earth, we know not where
But who receives a gift of love
It follows then that he must share
As I receive, so let me give,
And live in joy my whole life through.

Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.

And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.

Cause they've never really gone.

Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me,
Just an old fashioned love song

To underscore our love affair

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I've been doing all I can, my plan, your plan and all I get is hurt
This game we're playing has to stop

I've got you stuck in my head
And all you do is breaking me, I can't continue taking this
I've tried my best to understand
But I cannot make sense of you, I've got to take a stand and baby

I don't wanna waste another night
I don't wanna keep on chasing lights

I remember I met you, let you get your way in everything
You took complete control of me
I remember you lying, crying, trying to get away with it
But now I know 'cause now I see

I believed all that you said
I never questioned any lies and never opened up my eyes
And no your words got me mislead
But I am standing, I'm alive, I never had you on my side

The Saturdays,"I miss missing you
I miss missing you

Where's the pain when you walk out the door
It doesn't hurt like it used to before
Where's the love that we couldn't ignore
It doesn't kick like a pill anymore
Where's the thrill at the end of our fights
Where's the heat when we turn off the lights

I just miss all the miss that we made
When we still have the passion to hate

I miss missing you, sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears
Begging to get back together
I just want you to be
To be stuck in a second forever
So don't freak out and believe.

Sometimes I'm just missing
Missing You
I miss missing you

There's a dark cloud pulling me in
That's the girl I was breathing in sin
There's a blind force letting it win
And it's longing to tear us apart
I get high when you're making me weak
Let me down 'til I crawl on my knees

I just miss all the mess that we made
When we still have the passion to hate

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tears
Begging to get back together
I just want you to be
To be stuck in this second forever
So don't freak out if I leave

Sometimes I'm just missing, missing you
I miss missing you

Miss missing, miss missing, miss missing
I wanna crush in your arms at the other side of the world
Miss missing, miss missing, miss missing
I wanna die for you 'cause love is only true if it hurts

I miss missing you sometimes
I miss hurting you 'til you cry
I miss watching you as you try
Try not to end up in tear's (ooh)
Begging to get back together (together)
I just want you to be (want you to be, yeah)

Marks on my calendar
Don't hurry up the days
I wish I could speed up time

Subtract the distace

I'm hurting deep inside
I know you can feel this pain
But don't worry I'll be back again

Pretty soon I'll be coming home, home, home, home

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

To a degree.
I love the common folks.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

She started to change I nearly lost my mind
When she said that I'd be her honeybee
I realized she had put a spell on me

I realized I was inside her spider den

Tell me if you see Kay,

She said I won the battle but I lost the war,
And now my head is sore,
And if I try sail back in,
Shes gon' push me from the shore,
Now I won't ever get the time of day,
No way, no way, no
Now for what I said,
But for what I didn't say [Repeat: x2]

Will you tell her that I love her
If you see kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens
Say I'm missing everything about her
Make sure you say, I'm sweet FA
Without her
If you see kay

She got me saying sorry through the door,
She don't care anymore,
She says its too late now,
Should have thought of this before,
But I ain't gonna take this as defeat,
No way No way no,
Cos I'm gonna shout it out to everyone,
Everyone I meet

If you see kay
Will you tell her that I love her
If you see kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens
Say I'm missing everything about her
Make sure you say, I'm sweet FA
Without her
If you see kay

Now I'm sitting here in disbelief,
At how it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave,
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs,
They say you love someone enough you gotta set them free,
She said that was born to leave this town behind,
Knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied,
Saying its time to cut the ties,
Time to say goodbye, So she left
But she never never left my, never never left my mind

If you see kay
Will you tell her that I love her
If you see kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens
Say I'm missing everything about her
Make sure you say, I'm sweet FA

As it's fading from my face
Try to speak but nothings coming
Nothing I could say to make you stay

It's 3am now where you gonna go?
Gonna stay with friends in London
And that's all I get to know

Just a cigarette gone
No you couldn't' be that far
So I'm driving in my car where I hope you are
Maybe I can talk you down
Maybe I can talk you down

We're standing on a tiny ledge
Before this goes over the edge
Gonna use my heart and not my head
And try to open up your eyes
This is relationship suicide

While your racing through my mind
Cops can chase but they wont catch me

The Script,"It's been a while since the two of us talked
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain

So explain to me, how it came to this
Let's take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin city on a Friday night
With vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again
Before today
Before too long
Let's try and take it back before it all went wrong

There was a time that we'd stay up all night
Best friends, yeah, talking til the daylight
Took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain

Are you hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss
That you would drift on memory bliss
It was Grafton street, on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Who would have thought it would end up like this?

But everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong

Before the worst
Before we met
Before our hearts decided it's time to love again
Before today
Before too long
Let's try and take it back before it all went wrong

If these clouds don't clear
Then we'll rise above it, we'll rise above it
Heaven's gate is so near, come walk me through

And map my face out line by line
And somehow growing old feels fine
I listen close for I'm not smart
You wrap your thoughts in works of art
And they're hanging on the walls of my heart

I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as such
And though I may not look like much
I'm yours
And though my edges may be rough
And never feel I'm quite enough
It may not seem like very much
But I'm yours

You healed these scars over time
Embraced my soul
You loved my mind
You're the only angel in my life
The day news came my best friend died
My knees went weak and you saw me cry
Say I'm still the soldier in your eyes

I may not have the softest touch
I may not say the words as such

Named her baby Hope when she was just fourteen

Hope's too far gone

Could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way

When he gets that call
He's too far gone

Always tryna pave the way for women in a man's world

At some point every rose has to die

Where they go?
Who knows!

And feed him for life
You show your kids the truth
Hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better

Then just say that you're okay
I'm sleeping on your side of the bed
Goin' out of my head now

And if you're out there tryna move on
But something pulls you back again
I'm sitting here tryna persuade you like you're in the same room

And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
And I wish you could still give me a hard time
And I wish I could still wish it was over
But even if wishing is a waste of time
Even if I never cross your mind

I'll leave the door on the latch
If you ever come back, if you ever come back
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat
If you ever come back
There'll be a smile on my face and the kettle on
And it will be just like you were never gone
There'll be a light in the hall and the key under the mat
If you ever come back, if you ever come back now
Oh if you ever come back, if you ever come back

Now they say I'm wasting my time
'Cause you're never comin' home
But they used to say the world was flat
But how wrong was that now?

And by leavin' my door open
I'm riskin' everything I own
There's nothing I can lose in a break-in that you haven't taken

And I wish you could give me the cold shoulder
And I wish you can still give me a hard time

If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss
I know you're out there somewhere so just remember this
If it's the fighting you remember or the little things you miss

But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
Dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard
Was nothing

So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

Draw circles in the sand on a rainy day,

Whatever you put out there is coming back again
Years may burn (ohh)

The Script,"(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentine's Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone

And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah on and on

And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explained I was young, he would say

Take that rage, put it on a page
Take that page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying ""That's my kid!""

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on my heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away

I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must

You used to say I won't know a wind until it crossed me
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it
So if you lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now

Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)

Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
Oh if you could see me now
(Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd

You the links I think you haven’t seen yet
I’d like to tell you things that I think you never
Heard, but there are no words
I could talk all day long about dreams,
Sewing up your heart so you never see a seam
I could talk all day about politics,
All of the corruption, clean hands, dirty tricks

But what can I say, about something that blows me away
Without it sounding like another cliche
From what I’ve seen and I’ve heard,
When it comes to you, baby no, there are no, there are no words
There are no words, yeah I swear this much is true,
There ain’t a word in this world that describes you

I could talk all day long about life,
After so many wars, how we’re all still alive
I could speak all night long about the world,
How it took me thirty years just to find one girl
I could shoot you for days all about guitars,
A gibson or a fender, it depends on who you are
But when I try to say something that you never heard, there are no words
I could burn your ear off all about space,
Like why we have a moon, why the moon has a face
If the earth is spinning, why we all stay in place?
Why we can’t walk, there’s gotta be a space race

But what can I say, that’s gonna’ blow her mind away,
Turn around a classic now I throw it away
All I’ve seen all I’ve heard,
When it comes to you, there are no, there are no, there are no words

There are no words
Yeah I swear this much is true there ain’t a word in
This world to describe you

There are no words to describe or define what a sight, do you feel in your vibe
Believe me I’ve tried to break you down to a science
You in my mind and I open my mouth and it’s silence
I can articulate a Shakespeare poem even though I didn’t know him
I can’t see where he was going and where he’s coming from
I can’t even catch his flow and then I think of you
I don’t know where this metaphor is going
'Cause there ain’t no words you can understand,
Only lovers can you can ask the professor and the mad man
If they couldn’t find the words no one can

There’s just no, just no words",No Words

He's always working hard 'til the sun goes down

But he don't wear a no farm clothes, he's always using a rake and hoe,
But his seeds are starting to grow, like a big stalk up through the sky

He used to live in an apartment in a big old city
With thick and priestly windows built right in it
But he decided to move to a little tiny town
He wanted to be a farmer all year round
And on a country road where you can't see a thing
He's got five acres filled little green things, he said
He's working so hard all night and day

Mr. Farmer let me watch your crops
Mr. Farmer let me water your crops
Mr. Farmer let me harvest your crops
I want to have a dream come true
I said a farmer, farmer, farmer
I want to be just like you

See the farmer a walking down town, always draws a crowd when he's around
He's always wearing seedy clothes, he's shows them off wherever he goes

Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home",Five Hundred Miles
The Seekers,"As I went a-walkin' on Kilgary Mountain,
I spied Colonel Pepper, and his money he was countin';
I rattled out my pistols and I drew forth my saber,
Cryin', ""Stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver.""
(Chorus:)
Musha rig um do rum da,
Whack fol the daddy o,
Whack fol the daddy o,
There's whisky in the jar.
The gold and silver coins, they looked so bright and shiny,
Oh, I took them home straightway, and I gave 'em to my Molly;
She vowed and she promised that she never would deceive me,
But the devil's in the women, oh, you never can believe 'em.
(Chorus)
But when I awoke between six and seven,
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even;
I reached for my pistols, but alas, I was mistaken;
My pistols had been fired, and a prisoner I was taken.
(Chorus)
They put me in the jail without judge or writin',
For robbing Colonel Pepper, oh, on Kilgary Mountain,
But they didn't take my fists, so I knocked the sentry down,
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town.

Oh, others take delight in the carriages a-rollin';

The Seekers,"What am I to you?
What am I to do?
Now summer's almost through in September.
For love has come and gone,
Didn't stay for long;
One thing I will always remember.
When the green, whispering leaves had called your name,
The gentle, sighing winds, they did the same.
Now the sun has left the sky,
And for no reason why,
A sad cloud is crying tears of rain.
We stood and watched the rain;
Perhaps we will again,
For no one knows what's coming tomorrow.
One day you may find
That I am close behind;
Wherever you may go I will follow.
And the green, whispering leaves will call your name;
The gentle, sighing winds will do the same.
Now the sun is in the sky,
And for no reason why,
The sad cloud is crying itself away.

The gentle, sighing winds will do the same.

He came to my cottage door;
His words were few, but his look
Will linger for evermore,

More tender than words could be.

And he was the world to me.
There in her garden she stands,
All dressed in fine satin and lace,
Lady Mary, so cold and so strange;
In his heart she could find no place.
He knew I would be his bride,
With a kiss for a lifetime fee.
But I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
Now in his palace grand,
On a flower-strewn bed he lies.
His beautiful lids are closed
On his sad, dark, beautiful eyes.
And among the mourners who mourn,
Why should I a mourner be?
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.
For I was nothing to him,
And he was the world to me.

And the time between;
Yes, those were the good years,
The years of gold and green.
Two summers, two winters,
And the time between;
Yes, those were the good years,
The years of gold and green.
The warm winds grow cold now;
You're gone, you're gone.
My love couldn't hold you;
You're gone.
You were wild as the wind and born to be free,
Born to be free, free,
And gone from me.
And gone from me.",Two Summers

In all the world no one's so glad to see the sun as me.

Bowing her politely on to me.

The week has gone its lonely way;
I've waited for my only day
Away from shadows,
In her sunlight I can tell her, ""I love you, Angeline.""
Angeline is always Friday, suitcase on the rack above;
She hasn't even read her magazine.
Angeline is counting stations, 'til the one where I am standing,
Waiting for my only Angeline.

And when I turned around,
I found your note pushed under my door;
You'd gone without a sound.

Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me
And it's a hitch-hike a hundred miles
I'm a ragamuffin child
Pointed finger, painted smile
I left my shadow waitin' down the road for me a while
Cloudy -- my thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy
They have no borders, no boundaries
They echo and they swell
From Tolstoy to Tinkerbell
Down from Berkley to Carmell
Got some poems in my pocket
And a lot of time to kill
Hey sunshine
I haven't seen you in a long time
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?

Like a floating question why
And they linger there or die
They don't know where they're going
And, my friend, neither do I

This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Light that shines is the light of love,
Hides the darkness from above,
Shines on me and it shines on you,
Shows you what the power of love can do.
Shine my light both bright and clear,
Shine my light both far and near,
In every dark corner that I find,
Let my little light shine.
Monday gave me the gift of love,
Tuesday peace came from above,
Wednesday told me to have more faith,
Thursday gave me a little more grace,
Friday told me to watch and pray,
Saturday told me just what to say,
Sunday gave me the power divine
To let my little light shine.

From the dusty red-soil plains.
I am the ancient heart,
The keeper of the flame.
I stood upon the rocky shores,
I watched the tall ships come,
For forty thousand years I've been
The first Australian.

I came upon the prison ship,
Bowed down by iron chains,
I fought the land, endured the lash,
And waited for the rains.
I'm a settler, I'm a farmer's wife
On a dry and barren run,
A convict, then a free man,
I became Australian.

I'm the daughter of a digger
Who sought the mother lode.
The girl became a woman 
On the long and dusty road.
I'm a child of the Depression,
I saw the good times come,
I'm a bushie, I'm a battler,
I am Australian.

We are one, but we are many,
And from all the lands on earth we come.
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice,
""I am, you are, we are Australian""

I'm a teller of stories,
I'm a singer of songs,
I am Albert Namatjira
And I paint the ghostly gums.
I'm Clancy on his horse, 
I'm Ned Kelly on the run,
I'm the one who waltzed Matilda,
I am Australian.

I'm the hot wind from the desert,
I'm the black soil of the plains,
I'm the mountains and the valleys,
I'm the drought and flooding rains.
I am the rock, I am the sky,
The rivers when they run,
The spirit of this great land,
I am Australian.

The Seldom Scene,"Well I spent my whole lifetime
In a world where the sunshine
Finds excuses for not hangin' 'round
I squandered emotions
On the slightest of notions
And the first easy loving I found
But soon all the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away
There's times when I trembled
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away
With nothing to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face
Oh Lord if you're listening
I know I'm no Christian
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
Throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing away
Oh Lord if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away",Keep Me from Blowing Away [Live]

We're not afraid to die come on wheels take me home today

The Seldom Scene,"First time he saw the ground get busted
He was 10, it was 1952
His daddy worked hard
From sun up til sundown
And the goin' got tough
Behind them old gray mules

The farm grew to be a money maker
And the house he lived in
Grew up room by room
The boy worked hard
But soon got tired of farmin'
So he slipped away one night
B'neath the harvest moon

His neck was red
As alabama clay
But the city's call
Pulled him away
He's got a factory job
And run's a big machine
He don't miss the farm
Or the fields of green

Now the city's just a prison
Without fences
His job is just
A routine he can't stand
And at night he derams of wide open spaces
Gresh dirt tween his toes and on his hands

Then one day a picture came
Inside a letter
Of a young girl
With a baby in her arms
And the words she wrote
Would change his life forever
So he went to raise his family
On the farm

His neck was red
As alabama clay
Now he's going home
This time to stay
Where the roots run deep
On the family tree
And the tractor rolls
Through the fields of green

Your love would last forevermore
And it took me by surprise

The Seldom Scene,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones ",Long Black Veil

Where romance blooms and fades,
A great Philadelphia lawyer
Was in love with a Hollywood maid.

""Come, love, and we'll go ramblin'
Down where the lights are so bright.
I'll win you a divorce from your husband,
And we can get married tonight.""

Wild Bill was a gun-totin' cowboy,
Ten notches were carved in his gun.
And all the boys around Reno
Left Wild Bill's maiden alone.

One night when Bill was returning
From ridin' the range in the cold,
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart,
Her love was as lasting as gold.

As he drew near her window,
Two shadows he saw on the shade;
'Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love to Bill's Hollywood maid.

The night was as still as the desert,
The moon hangin' high overhead.
Bill listened awhile through the window,
He could hear ev'ry word that he said:

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely,
Your form's so rare and divine.
Come go with me to the city
And leave this wild cowboy behind.""

Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories

I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock, I am an island

I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain

It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died

The September Strings,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence

I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And much, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
But I did .. what I had to do
I'll see it through without devotion

I planned, each chartered course
Be careful thought along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

There were times, I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck, fuck fuck else to do

But through it all, when there was doubt
I shot it up, or kicked it out
I faced the wall .. and .. the wall
And did it my way

I've loved in bed last night
I've had my fill, my share of looting
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think, I killed a cat
And may I say .. not in the way
""But no, no, not me""
""I did it my way""

Opening doors and rattling chains, angel 
Last night I heard you 
Tapping your nails on the window pane, angel

Nightmare I cannot escape, shake my head but I'm awake
Cut myself, hurt myself, I'm sleepwalking 

Last night I saw you 
Stepping on glass and leaving no trace, angel
Like a spider creeping through the crack 
In the wall of a lonely place, angel

Follow every step I take, stranger I cannot forsake 
Shake myself, can't wake myself, I'm sleepwalking

In the corner of my eye, moving, shifting 
A figure dressed in white, floating, drifting

""Last night I touched you 
As you turned to hide your crying face, angel 
Last night I felt you
As you held me in your cold embrace, angel""

And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.

I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.

Women here, women there

She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill
One day she decided she'd go for a ride
With a pistol and a sword by her side

She rode right up to my front door
Knocked and knocked 'till her fist got sore
When she turned and walked away
All you could hear my baby say :

Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley
Hey! Bo Diddley

Saw my baby run across the field
Slippin' and sliddin' like an automobile

A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yi-pi-yi-ay, yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in ghost riders in the sky
Yi-pi-yi-ay, yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
The Shadows,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

You'll never know that I still love you

Will never wash away my misery

I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

You said you would always stay

Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun

So I choose freedom
Running 'round, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
Well I never expected it too

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

As for fortune and as for fame
Well I never invited them in
Though it seems to the world
They were all I desired

They were illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

The Shadows,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally 
Perfect situations must go wrong 
But this has never yet prevented me 
From wanting far too much for far too long 
Looking back, I could have done it differently 
Won a few more moments, who can tell? 
But it took time to understand the man 
Now at least I know, I know him well 

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 

No one in your life is with you constantly 
No one is completely on your side 
And though I move my world to be with him 
Still the gap between us is too wide 
Looking back, I could have played it differently 
Learned about the man before I fell 
But I was ever so much younger then 

Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine) 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 

Didn't I know how it would go 
If I knew from the start 
Why am I falling apart 

Wasn't it fine 
Isn't it madness he can't be mine 
But in the end, he needs a little more than before 
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom 
I know him so well 
It took some to understand him 
Hoo ooh I know him so well",I Know Him So Well
The Shadows,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.

Like bread onto the field
And when January all so warm
With this confusion builds

And I host their day
And I brought those nights
But then suddenly
When it all came down to the fight

You turn your head
You were held by nothing
And across your face
We could all read everything

Give a kiss to enemy
And free them from your hate
Well, how can this be, they dance
And we, we are, we are the same?

And I host their day
And I brought them sight
But then suddenly
When it all came down to the fight

Turn your head
You were held by nothing
And across your face

And I pray you don't get lost

Did they keep you from the rain?
Did they grow you some food to eat?
You know they will fall someday, they will fall someday

And how could your whole life be gone?
In seconds it turns all wrong
But all in time my dear the change will come

Did all your reasons stray right from the source?
And when you're walking and leaving
Well I pray you stay on course
And I pray you stay on course

There's new life in the old woods
But the feeling's just the same
Evolution of the chosen one

And how could your whole life be gone?

Or do you have it?

And laughing is all I have
Some mornings
I hope the light will understand

And all we have is now
Hold it in now but let her out now

I forgot we were one

Puts holes inside my brain

We ran down on the path in the woods
To that old swimming hole
Where we laugh and sing, stories are told
We lived like children do
We were kind to them and so brand new

And I loved it then
And I wonder what happened
And may the hard times be gone
And I'll learn what I've done wrong
And let's leave it on this

I took your wonder heart
I'm sorry that I tore you apart
And the summer went away
The rains came and I could not stay
With the birds I went south
Now I'm trying to get back somehow

Because I loved it then
And I wonder what happened
And may the hard times be gone
And I'll learn what I've done wrong
And let's leave it on this

The winter's life is full of roads and cars
And hash and fuel
And I've forgotten how to talk
Words that come, good they are not
I guess I'm paying for what I've done
The unknown crime hope forgiving will come

Turn me around and I promise I'll be good

Hello to you, these friends of mine
Here by this rock, we spend our time
You've learned so much to jet again
Well, all you need, babe, is a friend
You are a friend

Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene, know what I mean?
He created the vibe - He takes you for a ride as if by Design
The party ignites like it's comin' alive
He takes you to the top, shakes you all around
Then back down - you know as he gets mellow
Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move
He glides into your mind with a sunny ""Hello!""
A gentleman of leisure he's there for your pleasure
But go easy on old 'Ezeer he's the love you could lose
Extraordinary fellow, like Mr Punchinello
He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused
When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around
You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd
He gets them all at it, the party starts rocking, the people get excited
It's time to shout loud

It well may be it's followed me across the seas.

Does it still run down to Donny cove?

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye

Long live our love.

We had made a simple vow,
We vowed to love each other,

And it's not another girl,
But a lot of people need you,
There is trouble in the world.

And it's taken you far, far away.
But please don't wonder if I'll be faithful

While you are fighting overseas,
And I know one day if we are lucky,

Close your eyes

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around

Retrouver un job, quitte à même finir maçon
Mais son lourd casier faisait de lui un mauvais garçon
Déterminé à pas finir comme ça
Mais la vie refuse de lui laisser le choix
C'est comme si cet homme ne pouvait plus changer
Il est en stand by, c'est dur à supporter

Dites à ma femme que je l'aimerai

Tu me fais mal à la tête, à la mort quand je la vois à ton insu
Même si, j'ai des remords, en vrai je m'en bas les couilles

Quoi que je fasse cette fille est bien déterminée à rester sous mon toit
Quoi que je dise elle le prend au second degrés, elle me prend pour son roi
Je sentais qu'elle était prête à crier, ce que je ne voulais pas
Elle me textote, je répond presto à son texte plein d’émotion
Baby tu vois, je ne veux pas te faire de la peine

De son innocence, j'l'ai pas trop connue longtemps

Je suis a contre sens

Ai-je du mal a parler ?Où aurais-tu du mal à m'écouter?
Mes pensées sont lourdes, cependant, j'ai le cœur léger

Et le regarde des autres m'est insupportable
Baisser la tête, pour moi, c'est hors de question
Et mendier serait contre ma religion
Pour oublier mes blèmes, j'écris des chansons
J'suis prêt a prendre du biff de toutes les façons

The Shins,"An address to the golden door
I was strumming on a stone again,
Pulling teeth from the pimps of gore
When hatched a tragic opera in my mind,
And it told of a new design in which every soul is duty bound
To uphold all the statutes of boredom
Therein lies the fatal flaw of the red age

Because it was nothing like we'd ever dreamt
Or lust for life had gone away with the rent we hated
And becase it made no money nobody saved no one's life this time

So we burned all our uniforms
And let nature take it's course again
And the big onese just eat all the little ones
That sends us back to the drawing board

In my darkest hours
We have all asked for some
Angel to come
Sprinkle his dust all around
But all our crying voices they can't turn it around
And you've had some crazy conversations of your own

We've got rules and maps and guns in our backs but we still can't just behave ourselves,
Even if to save our own lives
So says I:
We are a brutal kind

'Cause this is nothing like we'd ever dreamt
Tell Sir Thomas More we've got another failed attempt
'Cause if it makes them money they might just give you life this time",So Says I

Well, you never spike a person
But you always bang the whole gang
Oh yeah...

Mince pie dog-eye
Eagle on the wind
I'm searching through this garbage
Just looking for a friend
Your uncle with an alligator
Chained to his leg
Dangles you your freedom
Then he offers you his bed

It seems to me to dream
Is something too wild
In Max's Kansas City
You're belladonna child
Riding on the highways
On the gateways to the south
You're talking with your boots
And you're walking with your mouth

For the very first time 
It's not wrong for him to say 
""Darling, I want you to be mine""

Now she can't stand on a portico 
And whistle when 
She goes walking by, oh no no 
She must hope that he can see 

The lovin' light burnin' 
In her eyes, oh yeah yeah 
She can't ask him 
To let her walk him home, oh no 

Nor can she ask him 
For the number 
The number on his telephone, oh no 

When a boy meets a girl, yeah, 
That he wants for the rest of his life 
He just walks right up to her 
And says, ""darling, please be my wife""

Makes you live, makes you die,

Don't wonder why, they have all the joys love can bring,
'Cause love is a swingin' thing.

Say you want my heart, (come on, come on) come on.
Say you need my love, (come on, come on, come on) come on. 
I may be young today, but tomorrow I will be grown 

Some people say love, love ain't this, that, and nothin,' I don't lie.
There is no other.
I don't need a wedding gown, I don't need a diamong ring,
'Cause I dig love; it's such a swingin' thing; you tell 'em, girls.

Some people say love, love takes all of your new kissing in the head.

The Shoes,"Verse 1 :

From A place where dark days are common
Wild brutes
These dog days are coming
To a few this may be uncommon
Daily politics but ain’t no house of commons (Nah)
Born leaders 
Sworn survivors 
From the gutter 
In the grit is where you’ll find us
Separate the weak from the fighters
Presented as the minority with mass destruction behind us
No rest for the wicked round ere
Souls lost like the wicker man’s here
And I swear they got wicked man ear
Dem A gwarn wicked like they nah care (uh)
I can’t blame them
Looks like hope has forsaken brave men
Look to the skies and pray, Amen
But no rest for the wicked no days end


Chorus :
No rest for the wicked round here
No rest for the wicked round here
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
And I swear they got wicked man here 
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
No rest for the wicked round here
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
And I swear they got wicked man here 
And I still Feed the Ghost.


Verse 2:
This coming from a place where dark days are common
I walk through the grounds of sodom 
They say reap we saw the fruits of your labour
But it’s like these laboured fruits are rotten
Death on the path
Till death do us part
Death of the heart
(Callousness) 
Baring the scares of the pain of my past
through the apathy translate in these bars
Locked in a cage fight
Face to face with my consequences 
From decisions that I made 
I
Felt like I would fall by the wayside 
And not make it through the raging fire
It’s thin line between love and hate
Fear and Faith 
I situate in a lukewarm state
(Lord help me)
No rest for the wicked till we feel death embrace

Chorus : 
No rest for the wicked round here
No rest for the wicked round here
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
And I swear they got wicked man here 
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
No rest for the wicked round here
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here
And I swear they got wicked man here 
And I still Feed the Ghost.

Verse 3:
 
Look behind the eyes and see,
Someone else's memory,
I'm taking to it easily,
Someone else's you and me,
We know what you do,
And we see where you go.
So Look behind the eyes and see,
Someone else's memory,
I'm taking to it easily,
Someone else's you and me,
We know what you do
But I still Feed the Ghost.
And I still Feed the Ghost
And I still Feed the Ghost
And I still Feed the Ghost

Wash it down and starve it back
To sleep tonight and not to dream

Death and taxes forth and back

But I don’t see an end

It’s not personal but the cross hairs stays on you
We give you victim hood, do with it what you will

Tries to choke her shame

Sometimes it just rains

Tired tongue and aching chest
What it takes outdoes your best
Death redraws the line

The Showtime Orchestra and Singers,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

The Showtime Orchestra and Singers,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

It's a great habit what you wanna kick it for 
You look at you, you're trembling putting me in that syringe 
You're pocking your skin you're trying to get me in 
You?ll shoot me through your eyelids just to get me to your brain 
The faster I can go there and ease your pain In your vein 
I just slither like a venoms snake and it's great 
I can't wait to end your heartache 
I slowly cross the blood brain barrier 
Give birth to morpheme finds to open your receptors 
You have a sensation; you're calling it a rush 
The intensity because you had all my drug 
And the faster that I find to open your receptors 
The more intense the rush is, it feels even better 
You might have a warm blushing in your skin 
Have a dry mouth or happiness in your limbs 
You might be nauseous, vomit, have severe itching 
But it's worth it nothing beats this here feeling [Chorus x3] 
You got problems in your life 
I can help you through it you tried to dump me once before but you couldn't do it 
You had insomnia, muscle and bone pain 
Worse than when you tried to leave my cousin named Cocaine 
You were vomiting, restless, had cold flashes 
It's just you and me no one knows you're an addict 
You're psychically dependent on me now. 
Don't you see that? 
You would die without me in your life, believe that I've infected your heart and collapsed you veins 
I?ve done sever damage to your brain 
Because of me you?ve had bacterial infections 
A small price to pay that's the cost of my affection 
The high is wearing of you're drowsy for a couple of hours 
My affects have got your mental function all clouded 
You heart rate drops you respiratory system slows 
You're slowly fading as a victim of my overdose 
You needed me but don't you see I don't need you 
There's a lot of people in this world that need me too 
I just used you like the stupid bitch you are 
I left you dead in your own vomit on the kitchen floor 
I didn't care about you; you're just a bitch to me 
I know you cheated on me with my brother 
Ecstasy We got more people to infect, you can't stop me 
These rehabs and clinics people still can't drop me

There ain't nothing in this world gonna slow me down

Yeah that's right
You can't stop me 
I'm just gonna keep going 
I'ma keep ending more lives, infecting more people 
This ain't never gonna stop

And I have lived alone
I live on an island 
And I waken to the dawn
A long time ago
I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning
And I brought him into me
Now today
Come morning light
He sails away
After one last night
I let him go.

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden
Is the sweetness there that grows
My hair it blows long
As I sing into the wind

And I have lived alone
I live on an island
I tell of nights
Where I could taste the salt on his skin

Salt of the waves
And of tears
And though he,pulled away
I kept him here for years
I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away
To be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart

And my song in the wind
The sand will sting my feet
And the sky will burn

I let him go

The Silent Comedy,"We were walking in a circle, hand in hand
And your feet were sinking deeper in the sand than mine
You had sold me the mansion in your head
I would cut your hair and you would dye it red as fire
As a crackling fire

And I would hold the phone
So you were not alone
I had to take you home, you couldn't even drive

You had smiled when you told me you were brave
And that your life was in other hands to save, not mine
I saw the mansion you had made me love ignite
And as you were fading, it was growing bright with fire
With a crackling fire

And when you tried to stand
You had to take my hand
You said ""I think your plan will be splitting from mine""

We made a pile of all your remaining clothes
Where you’re heading now you won’t be needing those, it’s fine
We soaked the pile till it dripped with gasoline
And then I lit a match as if I’d never seen a fire, fire, fire
It was a big roaring fire

And your heart beat failed
And it stopped leaving its trails
But the last thing you exhaled while you were alive was

I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
I am alright
And I'm doing just fine

Well, we're going out fishing for herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Wynken and Blynken and Nod

And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

'Cause if you don't, you're in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Deep, deep trouble.
Run into trouble.
Bart: Where's your sense of humour, man?
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
And they go a little something like this.

Bart: So I'm in the front yard, mowin' like crazy,
Sweatin' like a pig and the sun is blazing.
Homer's in the driveway, getting in the car,
With Mom and Lisa, hope they're going real far.
The dad yells
Homer: Bart
Bart: and I go Yo
He goes
Homer: You done yet?
Bart: and I go No.
So he goes
Homer: Oh! You're too slow.
Bart: So I step on the gas, to speed up the mow.
Didn't see that sprinkler underneath that tree,
Wham! Ccchhh! Pssshh! Raining on me!
I go Whoa, Homer goes
Homer: D'oh!
Now you can't go to the boatshow.

Bart: This is my thanks after working my butt off?
Homer revs the motor and they all start to putt off.
Soaked to the bone, standing in a puddle,
No-one needs to tell me I'm in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Marge: Go to your room.
Homer: Bart!
Bart: Yeah, right.
Marge: Bart, go to your room.
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Marge: Go to your room.

I know the answer. Well, you're damned if you do,
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Bart: Well, you're damned if you do,
And you're damned if you don't.

As soon as they're gone, I'm stretched on the lawn,
Lookin' at the sky with my sunshades on.
Now I've never ever claimed that I was a smarty,
But inspiration hits me, lets have a party.

Called up my posse, they were here in a flash,
They brought all their pals, we started to thrash.
There was romping and stomping, an occasional crash,
A fist fight or two, and Nintendo for cash.

We raided the fridge, dogs raided the trash,
I got a little worried when the windows got smashed.
The next thing you know, Mom and Dad are home,
The kids disappear and I'm all alone.

Everything's silent except for my moan,
And the low, bluesy tone of a saxophone.
They look at me, then they go into a huddle.
Get this sinking sensation I'm in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Homer: D'oh.
Marge: Oh.
Homer: Bart!
Bart: Oh, gimme a break.
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Homer: Hey. What is this?
Back: Don't keep trouble.
Marge: Go to your room.
Lisa: Oh yeah.
Marge: Bart, go to your room.
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Marge: Go to your room.
Bart: Okey, dokey.
Homer: Bart!

Bart: There's a little epilogue to my tale of sadness.
I was dragged down the street by his Royal Dadness.
We rounded the corner and came to a stop,
Threw me inside Jake's Barber Shop.

I said, Please Sir, just a little off the top.
Dude shaved me bare, gave me a lollipop.
So on my head, there's nothing but stubble.
Man, I hate being in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Bart: Well, you're damned if you do,
Back: Trouble! Trouble!
Bart: Well, you're damned if you do,
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Bart: Well, you're damned if you do,
and you're damned if you don't.
Back: Nothing but trouble.
Bart: Aw, come on, man.
Well, you're damned if you do,
(What are we talking about?) Well, you're damned if you do,
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
Bart: (Where's your sense of humour?)
Well, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.

Each morning at nine, they trickle through the gates
They go home early, they come in late

Reeking of cheap liquor they stumble through the day

I know it shouldn't vex me, I shouldn't take it hard
I know I should ignore their capering with a kingly disregard, but

Ooh, look at all those boobs

Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing the blues

They make personal phone calls
On company time
They Xerox their buttocks
And guess who pays the dime

Their blatant thievery wounds me
Their ingratitude astounds
I long to lure them to my home
And then release the hounds

I shouldn't grow unsettled
When faced with such abuse
I shouldn't let it plague me
I shouldn't blow a fuse

Yes, well, call this Simpson to my office
And stay to watch the fun
If he's 6 feet when he enters
He'll be two feet when I'm done

To my unhappy life
To make him kneel before me
And slowly twist the knife

Fixin' test scores to get the best scores.
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor.
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art,
Last name Simpson, first name Bart.

I'm here today to introduce the next phase,
The next step in the big Bart craze.
I've got a dance real easy to do;
I learned it with no rhythm, and so can you.

So move your body if you've got the notion,
Front to back in a rock-like motion.
Now that you've got it, if you think you can,
Do it to the music--that's the Bartman.

Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who?

But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show
