Julio Iglesias,"The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind
Warm summer wind
The summer wind",Summer Wind
Julio Iglesias,"Tiritas pa' este coraz?n part?o
Tiri-ti-tando de fr?o
Tiritas pa' este coraz?n part?o
Pa' este coraz?n

Ya lo ves que no hay dos sin tres
Que la vida va why viene why que no se detiene
?why qu? s? yo?
Pero mi?nteme aunque sea, dime que algo queda
Entre nosostros dos
Que en tu habitaci?n nunca sale el sol
Ni existe el tiempo ni el dolor

Ll?vame si quieres a perder
A ning?n destino sin ning?n por qu?

Ya lo s? que coraz?n que no ve es coraz?n que no siente
Coraz?n que te miente, amor
Pero, sabes que en lo m?s profundo de mi alma sigue aquel dolor
Por creer en ti
?Qu? fue de la ilusi?n why de lo bello que es vivir?

?Para qu? me curaste cuando estaba her?o
Si hoy me dejas de nuevo el coraz?n part?o?

?Qui?n me va a entregar sus emociones?
?Qui?n me va a pedir que nunca le abandone?
?Qui?n me tapar? esta noche si hare fr?o?
?Qui?n me va a curar el coraz?n part?o?
?Qui?n llenar? de primaveras este enero
Why bajar? la luna para que juguemos?
Dime si t? te vas, dime, cari?o m?o
?Qui?n me va a curar el coraz?n part?o?

Tiritas pa' este coraz?n part?o
Tiri-ti-tando de fr?o
Tiritas pa' este coraz?n part?o
Pa' este coraz?n

Dar solamente aquello que te sobra
Nunca fue compartir, sino dar limosna, amor
Si no lo sabes t?, te lo digo yo
Despu?s de la tormenta siempre llega la calma
Pero s? que despu?s de ti, despu?s de ti no hay nada

",Corazón Partío
Julio Iglesias,"Aunque lo intente mil veces
No puedo ahogar lo que a tu alma pertenece
Y así olvidar

Día a día me despierto creyendo oír tu voz
Día a día, todavía, me duele nuestro adiós
Quien no se ha equivocado, no trató
Quien nunca ha perdonado, nunca amó
Y quien jamás pecó, jamás vivió

Día a día la nostalgia me impulsa a continuar
Día a día la distancia me aconseja olvidar
Tú y yo con un pedazo de razón
Y compartiendo el mismo corazón
Que hemos partido en dos

Día a día
Sueño con tu amor
Día a día
Necesito tu calor

Aunque lo intente mil veces
No puedo ahogar
Lo que a tu alma pertenece
Me va a matar
Te importa que yo quiera así
Si en el fondo no me quieres más

Día a día
Sueño con tu amor
Día a día
Necesito tu calor

Ya no se puede aguantar
Y que no te acuerdes de mí
Tú quieres estar con otro
Que yo me muera por ti

Aunque lo intente mil veces
No puedo ahogar
Lo que a tu alma pertenece
Y así olvidar

",Día a Día
Julio Iglesias,"En medio de una riña
Ya casi al terminar
Uno habla y el que escucha
No para de llorar

Y en su mirada triste
De desamor y pena
Descubre de repente
Que el otro lo destierra

El que ha perdido todo
Ya fuera de lugar
Arruga en su maleta
La ropa sin planchar

Su corazón herido
Empieza a latir fuerte
Mientras que el otro ajeno
Ni late por su suerte

Y lejos uno de otro
En busca de otras gentes
Dos corazones rotos
En mundos diferentes

Descubren otra vida
Descubren otras cosas
Y empiezan otra vez
Dos corazones, dos historias

Quien quiso ser más libre
El que jugó a su modo
Aquel que no sentía
Lo que sentía el otro

Vagando por las calles
Entre aturdido y solo
Comienza a darse cuenta
Que lo ha perdido todo

Y aquellas cosas simples
Que nunca dio importancia
Le comen la cabeza
Le empiezan a hacer falta

Y ahora en su derrota
Porque perdió la apuesta
Descubre que la vida
Le está pasando cuenta

Y lejos uno de otro
En busca de otras gentes
Dos corazones rotos
En mundos diferentes

Descubren otra vida
Descubren otras cosas
Y empiezan otra vez
Dos corazones, dos historias

Julio Iglesias,"Si tu mama tuvo la culpa, tu papá la tuvo más
Si tu mamá tuvo la culpa, tu papá la tuvo más
Ay, ay, ay a la orilla de la empalizá
Ay, ay, ay a la orilla de la empalizá

Me contaron que te vieron con la falda remangá
A la vera de un camino, a la sombra de un trigal
Ay, ay, ay a la orilla de la empalizá

Con la luna por testigo te besaba aquel chaval
Si es pecado lo que hiciste, yo te juro que es venial

Cómo lo ves, cómo lo ves
Todos nosotros lo hicimos también
Cómo lo ves, cómo lo ves
Todos los negros tomamos café

Ay, Si tu mamá tuvo la culpa, tu papá la tuvo más

No le cuentes nada, ríete de ellos
Que no eres culpable, que todos lo hicieron

Si todos nacimos de aquel mismo juego
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Tu papa why tu mama también se prendieron
Ay, ay, ay a la orilla de la empalizá

Yo sé que te va a gustar
He nacido tantas veces
No me quiero morir más

Me he salvado en tantas guerras
Me he cansado de llorar
Why ahora que ya estoy de vuelta
Quiero vivir más

Unos nacen con todo
Why otros casi sin na'
Pero todos llevamos un ticket que dice
Principio why final, caballero

Caballero, hay que gozar la vida
Que de pronto el tiempo se te va
Disfruta lo que tienes
Que cuando te vayas, no te llevas na'

Camina pa'lante, no le tengas miedo
Que los que critican se critican ellos

Julio Iglesias,"Un ticket de ida why vuelta, fui tan sólo para ti
Juguete de carton
Un pobre pasajero que dejaste por ahí
Tirado en la estación

Devuélveme un trocito de mi vida
Devuélveme un poquito nada más
Un poco más
Devuélveme aunque sea de mentira
Que no curen mis heridas
Why me muera cada día mal

Mal acostumbrado me dejó tu amor
Mal acostumbrado tu amor me dejó
Alma en pena que mi cuerpo la condena
De no poder ya vivir sin ti

Mal acostumbrado me dejó tu amor
Mal acostumbrado tu amor me dejó
Why hoy me ciegas, me persigues why me encierras
Why es que ya no sé vivir sin ti
Vivir sin ti

Mi amiga la tristeza
La que sabe más de mí
No para de decir, sólo a mí
Que ría why que me olvide
Why no piense más en ti
Why vuelva a ser feliz
",Mal Acostumbrado (Mal Acostumado)
Julio Iglesias,"Ay, desnudo tu cuerpo en mi mente
Y bebo de ti la ansiedad
De una pasión que con todo puede
Que vence a la voluntad
Que no es amor ni es amar

Yo no sé quien eres tú
Yo no sé quien eres tú
Entre lo rojo y lo azul
Yo no sé quien eres tú

Tu alma viste un desierto de color
Entre lo rojo y lo azul
Yo no sé quien eres tú
Yo no sé quien eres tú

Ay, que nada se quede sin ver
Ya no se puede esperar
No existirán ni miedos ni olvidos
Para sentir aún más
Que no es amor ni es amar

Yo no sé quien eres tú

Tu alma viste un desierto de color

",No Es Amor Ni Es Amar (Gone Too Far)
Julio Iglesias,"Nadie escoge a su familia
O a su raza cuando nace
Ni el ser rico, pobre, bueno, malo
Valiente o cobarde
Nacemos de una decisión
Donde no fuimos consultados
Why nadie puede prometernos resultados

Cuando nacemos no sabemos
Ni siquiera nuestro nombre
Ni cual será nuestro sendero
Ni lo que el futuro esconde
Entre el bautizo why el entierro
Cada cual hare un camino
Why con sus decisiones, un destino

Somos una baraja más
De un juego que otro ha comenzado
Why cada cual apostará
Según la mano que ha heredado

La vida es una puerta
Donde no te cobran por la entrada
Why el alma es el tiquete que al vivir
Te rasgan cuando pagas
Why cada paso crea una huella
Why cada huella es una historia
Why cada ayer es una estrella
En el cielo de la memoria

why la marea del tiempo
Lleva why trae nuestras contradicciones
Why entre el regreso why la despedida
Cicatrizan los errores
Why cada amigo es la familia
Que escogemos entre extraños
Why entre la espera why el encuentro
Uno aprende con los años

Que solamente a la conciencia
Nuestro espíritu responde
Why que una cosa es ser varón
Why otra es ser hombre

Nadie escoge a su familia
O a su raza cuando nace
Ni el ser bueno, malo, lindo, feo
Inocente o culpable
Del nacimiento hasta la muerte
Toda vida es una cuesta
De nuestra voluntad depende la respuesta.

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe

Donde nunca desechemos la razón de los demás
Donde jamás olvidemos dar la mano
Al que se queda atrás

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe

why quien sepa más de todo
Que lo enseñe a los demás
Para que todos sepamos
De la vida siempre un poquito más

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe

why dejar a nuestra tierra
Mejor que cuando a ella entramos
Con la esperanza de un niño
Why ese calor del verano

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe

Julio Iglesias,"Cai a chuva e é noite, na longa estrada
Que longo é meu caminho, só eu e mais nada

Quilômetros passando, pensando nela
Que noite, que silêncio, soubesse ela
Que estou correndo, pensando nela

Os carros no caminho, sempre passando
Os ruídos dos caminhãµes, acelerando
Não há gente nessa rua, está chovendo
A noite é mais escura, estou sofrendo
Estou correndo, pensando nela

Sigo por essa estrada sem ter você
Sem saber se um dia te encontrarei
Acelerei

Os bares nessa hora, estão fechando
Os motéis dos amantes sempre esperando
Um trem cruza o caminho, é muito lento'
Enquanto vão depressa meus pensamentos
Pensando nela, pensando nela

Sigo por essa estrada sem ter você
Sem saber se um dia te encontrarei
Acelerei

Pensando, imaginando, a dor aumenta
Derrapo em uma curva
O freio esquenta
A agulha marca cento e sessenta

Sigo por essa estrada sem ter você
Sem saber se um dia te encontrarei
Acelerei

Cai a chuva e a noite parece eterna
Ciúmes me deixam louco pensando nela
Perdido na incerteza e na neblina
Não vejo que estou quase sem gasolina

Cai a chuva e é noite, na longa estrada
Não sinto nem o silêncio, da madrugada
Cai a chuva e é noite, na longa estrada
Não sei se ela espera, não sei mais nada

Cai a chuva e é noite, na longa estrada
Que noite, só eu mais nada

Caminando por las calles sin amor
Oficinas con las luces apagadas
Why vidrieras con letreros de neón

Cómo es triste la ciudad de madrugada
Cuando hay cosas que no puedes entender
Cuando ves que aquel amor que tanto amabas
Ya no está, ya no regresa, ya se fue

Tu recuerdo está en el alma why siento frío
Mi mundo vacío, vacío de amor

Cómo es triste la ciudad de madrugada
Cuando sientes que estás solo, sin amor
Cuando todo te da igual, no tienes ganas, oh no
Cuando ves que todo es nada sin amor

Los lugares, si no estás, no son lo mismo
Why yo caigo en un abismo, en depresión
Cómo triste esta ciudad si tú me faltas
Voy sin rumbo, sin ninguna dirección

Tu recuerdo está en el alma why siento frío
Mi mundo vacío, vacío de amor

Cómo es triste la ciudad de madrugada
Cuando sientes que estás solo, sin amor
Cuando todo te da igual, no tienes ganas, oh no

Mañana sabado, dia de la Virgen 

Me lleva el o me lo llevo yo 
Pa' que se acabe la vaina

Porque no me da la gana 
Moralito a mi no me lleva 
Porque no me da la gana 

Que cultura, que cultura va a tener 
Un indio chumeca como Lorenzo Morales 
Que cultura va a tener si nació en los cardonales 

Morales mienta mi mama 
Solamente pa' ofender 
Para que el también se ofenda 
Ahora le miento la de el

Me lleva el o me lo llevo yo

Que el a mi me iba a ganar

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way

Its more than a touch or a word we say 
Only in dreams could it be this way 
When you love someone

From the moment I wake up till deep in the night 
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be 
Than holding you, tenderly.

All who love are blind

When your heart's on fire
You must realize

I am without, without my love

Now laughing friends deride

De un bohemio por una reina

De mi mano sin fuerza 
Cayó mi copa sin darme cuenta

Julio Iglesias,"Voy a cantarles un corrido muy mentado
Lo que ha pasado allí en la hacienda de la flor
La triste historia de un ranchero enamorado
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador
Juan se llamaba, y lo apodaban charrasqueado
Era valiente y arriesgado en el amor
A las mujeres más bonitas se llevaba
En aquellos campos no quedaba ni una flor
Un día domingo que se andaba emborrachando
A la cantina le corrieron a avisar

""Cuídate juan que ya por ahí te andan buscando
Son muchos hombres no te vayan a matar""
No tuvo tiempo de montar en su caballo
Pistola en mano se le echaron de a montón
Estoy borracho les gritaba y soy buen gallo
Cuando una bala atravesó su corazón

Creció la milpa con la lluvia en el potrero
Y las palomas van volando al pedregal
Bonitos toros llevan hoy al matadero
Que buen caballo va montando el caporal
Ya las campanas del santuario están doblando

Todos los fieles se dirigen a rezar
Y por el cerro los rancheros van bajando
A un hombre muerto que lo llevan a enterrar
En una choza muy humilde llora un niño
Y las mujeres le aconsejan y se van
Mientras su madre lo consuela con cariño
Mirando al cielo llora y reza por su Juan
Aquí termino de cantar este corrido
De Juan ranchero, charrasqueado y burlador
Que se creyó de las mujeres consentido
Que fue borracho, parrandero y jugador",Juan Charrasqueado

Julio Iglesias,"Probablemente ya, de mi ta has olvidado 
Y mientras tanto yo, te seguiré esperando 
No me he querido ir, para ver si algún día 
Que tu quieras volver, me encuentres todavía 

Por eso aun estoy, en el lugar de siempre
En la misma ciudad y con la misma gente 
Para que tu al volver, no encuentres nada extraño 
Y sea como ayer y nunca más dejarnos

Se me olvidaba que, ya habíamos terminado 
Que nunca volverás, que nunca me quisiste 
Se me olvido otra vez, que solo yo te quise

Julio Iglesias,"Fue en un pueblo con mar una noche 
Después de un concierto
Tu reinabas detrás 
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto

Cántame una canción al oído y te pongo un cubata
Con una condición 
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata
Loco por conocer los secretos 
De tu dormitorio
Esa noche cante 
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio

Los clientes del bar uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tu saliste a cerrar 
Yo me dije cuidado chaval te estas enamorando
Luego todo paso de repente 
Tu dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón 
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda

Caminito al ostar nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar 
Yo quería dormir contigo tu no querías dormir sola

Y nos dieron las diez y las once
Las doce y la una, las dos y las tres 
Y desnudos al anochecer
Nos encontró la luna

Nos dijimos adios ojala que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabo 
El otoño duro lo que tarda en llegar el invierno
Fui a tu pueblo el azar otra vez 
El verano siguiente
Me llevo y al final 
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente

Y no alle quien de ti me dijera 
Ni media palabra
Parecía como si 
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No habia nadie detras de la barra 
Del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar 
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispanoamericano
Tu memoria vengue a pedradas 
Contra los cristales
Se que no lo soñé 
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

Y en mi declaración alegue
Que llevaba tres copas
Y empece esta canción 
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa

Y nos dieron las diez y las once 
Las doce y la una las dos y las tres 
Y desnudos al anochecer nos encontró la luna

Y nos dieron las diez y las once 
Las doce y la una las dos y las tres 
Y desnudos al anochecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron las Diez

Porque mi vida yo la aprendido a vivir así 
Bamboleiro, bamboleira 
Porque mi vida yo la aprendido a vivir así 

Cuando el amor 
Llega así de esa manera 
Uno no se da ni cuenta 
El carutal reverdece 
Y el guamanchito florece 
Y la soga se revienta 

Cuando el amor 
Llega así de esa manera 
Uno no tiene la culpa 
Quererse no tiene horarios 
Ni fecha en el calendario 
Cuando las ganas se juntan 

Caballo te dan sabana 
Porque estás viejo y cansado 
Pero no se dan ni cuenta 
Que un corazón amarrado 
Cuando le sueltan la rienda 
Es caballo desbocado 

Y si una potra alazana 
Caballo viejo se encuentra 
El pecho se le desgrana 
Y no hace caso a falseta 
Y no le obedece a un freno 
Ni lo para falsa rienda

Porque le sobra la edad 
Caballo viejo no puede 
Perder la flor que le dan 
Porque después de esta vida 
No hay otra oportunidad

Julio Iglesias,"Llueve y está mojada la carretera
Qué largo es el camino, qué larga espera!
Kilómetros pasando pensando en ella
Qué noche, qué silencio! Si ella supiera
Que estoy corriendo
Pensando en ella

Las luces de los coches que van pasando
El ruido de camiones acelerando
No hay gente por la calle y está lloviendo
Los pueblos del camino ya están durmiendo
Y yo corriendo
Pensando en ella

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré
Aceleré

Los bares a estas horas están cerrando
Hoteles de parejas siempre esperando
Un tren me cruza el paso es largo y lento
Me comen la cabeza los pensamientos
Pensando en ella
Pensando en ella

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré
Aceleré

Pensando imaginando mi duda aumenta
Me salgo de una curva sin darme cuenta
La aguja marca una cuarteta

Sigo en la carretera buscándote
Al final del camino te encontraré
Aceleré

Llueve y está mojada la carretera
Y yo sintiendo celos pensando en ella
Perdido entre la duda y la neblina
Me estoy quedando solo sin gasolina

Llueve y está mojada la carretera

Julio Iglesias,"Eras niña de largos silencios y ya me querias bien 
Tu mirada buscaba la mia jugabas a ser mujer 
Pocos años ganados al tiempo 
Vestidos con otra piel 
Y mi vida que nada esperaba tambien te queria bien 

Te extrañaba yo tanto 
Que no al verte a mi lado 
Ya soñaba con volverte a ver 
Y entre tanto te estaba inventando 
De niña a mujer 

Y esa niña de largos silencios volaba tan alto que 
Mi mirara queria alcanzarla que no la podia ver 
La paraba en el tiempo pensando 
Que no debería crecer 
Pero el tiempo me estaba engañando 
Mi niña se hacia mujer 

La queria ya tanto que al partir de mi lado 
Ya sabia que la iba a perder
Es que el alma le estaba cambiando 
De niña a mujer 

La queria ya tanto que al partir de mi lado 
Ya sabia que la iba a perder
Es que el alma le estaba cambiando

Tu encanto rememoro a cada instante
Romance del momento en que vivieras
Con el alma iluminada, descubriendo en tu mirada
Un amor que nadie tuvo para mi
Aunque aciago el destino, dividió nuestro camino
Y angustiado para siempre te perdí

Fatalidad signo cruel, en su rodar se llevo
El mas valioso joyel que tu querer me brindo
El calor permanente de un cariño
Que ávido como un niño de ti tanto espere

Porque te fuiste mujer, como un sueño fugas
Dejando en todo mi ser una ansiedad pertinaz
Ahora espero en las noches tu regreso
Al sitio donde un beso fue chispa de mi fe

Estrella fugitiva de mi anhelo
Me lleva por desconocido cielo
Detente no me robes la alegría
Sin tu influjo iluminoso, mi existencia es un destrozo
Oh gitana son tus ojos mi guion
No te apartes del camino, bella luz que me ilumina
Oh gitana mi nocturno de pasión

Me persigue el recuerdo de tu extraño mirar
Esa risa tan tuya, tus labios tentadores 
Que dejaron su encanto prendido en mi ansiedad

En mi alma vagabunda se fundió el alma tuya 
Como el llano se funde cuando lo besa el sol
Por eso, aunque otros labios me dieron su ternura 
Ninguno como el tuyo llego a mi corazón 

Fueron los ojos tuyos temas de mis canciones 
Fueron los labios tuyos música en mi cantar 
Y ahora son tus ojos mi pena y mis dolores 
Son esos labios tuyos mi destino fatal

Dicen que con el tiempo los recuerdos se esfuman
Se ahonda en el olvido lo que fue una pasión
Mentira, cuando mueras y bajas a mi tumba 
Verás que aún por ti arde la llama de mi amor

En mi loca bohemia he amado a otras mujeres 
Con la fe infinita del que quiere olvidar 
Mas siempre me atormentan tus ojos soñadores 
Y nostálgicamente suspiro al evocar
Que de reminiscencias hay en los sueños míos 
Crepúsculos enteros he llorado por ti 
Que aún están mis ojos del llanto humedecidos 
Evocando esas horas que aún viven en mí",Reminiscencias

Si nos dejan, te llevo de la mano, corazón, y nos vamos

Si nos dejan, de todo lo demás nos olvidamos",Si Nos Dejan
Julio Preciado,"Te vas ángel mío ya vas a partir
Dejando mi alma herida y un corazón a sufrir

Te vas ángel mío, ya vas a partir
Dejando mi alma herida y un corazón a sufrir
Te vas y me dejas un inmenso dolor
Recuerdo inolvidable me ah quedado de tu amor

Pero hay cuando vuelvas no me hallaras aquí
Iras a mi tumba y ahí rezaras por mi
Veras unas letras escritas ahí
Con el nombre y la fecha del día en que fallecí

Pero hay cuando vuelvas no me hallaras aquí
Iras a mi tumba y ahí rezaras por mí
Veras ángel mío, ya vas a partir
Dejando mi alma herida y un corazón a sufrir

Julio Preciado,"Nada nunca nada te negaba
Porque estaba realmente enamorado
Te entregue mi corazón ilusionado
Mientras que de amor migajas tu me dabas 

Dedique mi tiempo entero para amarte 
Y mis noches de pasión no compartías
Que cumplieras tu amenaza de marcharte
Eso a mi me desgastaba hasta la vida

Es que yo estaba loco, loco de tenerte entre mis brazos
Loco sometido a tus encantos y tu amor me dejo 
Solo un cruel desencanto 

Y es que yo estaba loco, loco obsesionado en complacerte 
Si fue un trago amargo conocerte
O mejor de tu amor, lo mejor fue perderte

Y es que yo estaba loco",Lo Mejor Fue Perderte
Julio Sosa,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",La Cumparsita/Por Qué Canto Así

A besar otros labios mientras lloro por dentro
Mi corazón
Sufre la pena pero lo hace en silencio
Porque cobro
El amor que me daba cada caricia y beso

Ahogue mi amor
En un mar lleno de lagrimas
Y naufrago
Una pasión que terminaba
No le hago al mártir ni quiero llorarla pero la recuerdo
Cuando se fue me faltaba hasta el aire pero mas sus besos
A lo mejor
La sigo Amando y me duele saberlo
Por eso voy
A besar otros labios mientras lloro por dentro
Mi corazón
Sufre la pena pero lo hace en silencio
Porque cobro
El amor que me daba cada caricia y beso",Pero la Recuerdo

Julius LaRosa,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

That leads to your door
Will never disappear

That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here

Julius LaRosa,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

Julius LaRosa,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Julius LaRosa,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

That this heart of mine embraces all day through

The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new

Feel my arms around you

Waited just to love you

And seal it with a kiss

Julius LaRosa,"Nobody can tell ya;
There's only one song worth singin',
They may try and sell ya,
'Cause it hangs them up to see someone like you.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.
You're gonna be knowing
The loneliest kind of lonely,
It may be rough goin',
Just to do your thing's the hardest thing to do.
But you've gotta make your own music
Sing your own special song,
Make your own kind of music even if nobody else sings along.

Julius LaRosa,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine

Someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Julius LaRosa,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are

Where the earth knows peace with man
When a storm hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend

Where friendships never end
Touched only by the seasons
Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

I traveled the long road just me and my intuition
No body seemed to understand just why I left with the clothes on by back
They asked why such a drastic change
I just know that my decision will put me on track

That is why I traveled the long road
So I can smile again feel good inside again maybe even laugh again
I am going to travel

They closed so many doors on me
So I climbed right in the window
'Cause as long as I can breathe I see that my spirit is protecting me
Oh they say that good things come to those who have the patience to remain the same
Don't sacrifice your everything just to be some temporary vision that's gonna change

You've gotta travel the long road
So you can smile again feel good inside again maybe even laugh again
You have got to travel

Just let your heart carry you through cause it knows what you are trying to do
And love is such a beautiful truth it gives strength to make it through
When you walking down the road of life keep your head up and get ready to run
'Cause you probably have to feel some pain
But it's a sacrifice a chosen few will have to make

You've gotta travel
They say that good things come to those who have the patience to remain the same
Don't you sacrifice your everything just to be some temporary vision that's gonna change

You've gotta travel the long road
So you can smile again
Feel good inside again maybe even laugh again

And would have a fit if I cried all night

Oh no

Shouldn't cry when I miss you
If you were here
You wouldn't tolerate me feelin' in pain
Callin' out your name

'Cause there's no one I can turn to
No one I can call
Nobody to catch me when I fall
No one I can call
Nobody to catch me when I fall

So I'm sending this prayer up you,
I know you can hear me from there
Sitting next to God's chair
You're my angel watching over
I only wish I could see you, feel you, say I love you

Kwela man, singing under the street light
A cheap guitar, he gave his sorrow a smile
And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela

You gave it your life

Living low with the Pennywhistle, tea-chest base gang
I followed him home and he danced as he sang
But now he's gone, not even the slightest traces
Of a Kwela song and the street is full of empty spaces

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela

You gave it your life

Nobody knows, did he survive the winding road?
Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland?
Here I stand, lost in the memory
Of a Kwela man, singing in the long gone twilight

When I followed you home Kwela man
You filled my soul, Kwela, Kwela
When you sang your song Kwela man
You gave it your life

Balanced on the edge of the sky

Deep down inside

Summer in a mountain town
No matter where I've been the places don't count
And I feel let down
'Cause nobody told me

I am the driver
From dust to dust

We hold on, until it begins again
We hold on, we hold on...

Till I saw yours shine
Spilling from your laughter
Sparkling in your eyes
Sharing my confusion, sharing my surprise
At finding part of me in you, alive
'Cause nobody told me

Body is the bus
I am the driver
From dust to dust
Trying to be near you
Searching for a way
Listening to your life song
Before it fades away
We hold on, and when the story ends
We hold on, we hold on.

Body is the bus
I am the driver from dust to dust
Now I'm falling, falling away
I hear you calling, calling my name

Pass my eyes on, on to the next one
I will be long gone, long gone
Across the distance, this divide
I will be with you forever
Till you reach the other side

Impi! wo 'nans' impi iyeza
Obani bengathinta amabhubesi?
All along the river chelmsford's army lay asleep
Come to crush the children of mageba
Come to exact the realm's price for peace
And in the morning as they saddled up to ride
Their eyes shone with the fire and the steel
The general told them of the task that lay ahead
To bring the people of the sky to heel
Chorus
Mud and sweat on polished leather
Warm rain seeping to the bone
They rode through the season's wet weather
Straining for a glimpse of the foe
Hopeless battalion destined to die
Broken by the benders of kings
Vainglorious general and victorian pride
Would cost him and eight hundred men their lives
Chorus
They came to the side of the mountain
Scouts rode out to spy the land
Even as the realm's soldiers lay resting
Mageba's forces were at hand
And by the evening the vultures were wheeling
Above the ruins where the fallen lay
An ancient song as old as the ashes
Echoed as mageba's warriors marched away

July for Kings,"Waiting tables at your restaurant job
An old man reads the paper in the booth
Where I stop
To say hello when I'm in town

To ask a friend if you're around
And I think about those summer nights
We never slept we didn't mind

And I felt so alive and happy
Just sitting on the porch
And swinging back and forth 
Now everything seems so distant

But I promise I'm not too far
When you're alone in your brand new car
Driving your new black car
Into the rain

Are you listening to the radio
Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
I imagine you there

I'm sitting by the window here
The morning birds will reappear
And I feel empty
Our songs are on the radio

You call me up but I have to go
And I'm sorry angel
I'm sorry
But I'll call you right back

I swear
You think I've left you there
Alone with an empty chair
But I whisper your name

Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
I imagine you there

Are you driving down a city road
Are you alone in your new black car
The wind in your hair

Are you tired of watching the rain hit the glass
All alone but aware of the places we've passed
Together we were singing along to the songs
Are you now? are you now?
I'm thinking of you in your college town
Are you thinking of me as you're driving around
Are you listening to me? are you listening?

On the banks that day
As we left the world behind
It was upstream then
Like it's upstream now
In this livelong outside
There's a trestle across the water
Like my hands across that year
For a moment the green was mine 

And our footsteps worn
From years of rain
And it held my hand
Like it holds my name
And my childhood born
And the difference
The water washed away

I'm bruised and red
From the pain of rock
Stepping stones until I fall
And daggers when I land
A roman candle in my hand
Was a weapon to the outside
And I walked in my father's wake
I prayed to a god to take
The endlessness of those shores

And our footseps worn
From years of rain
And he held my hand
He still holds my name
And my childhood born
And the difference

By the waterside left
To other souls(soles) without love or hate
They're bleeding the everything
They're soiling the brilliant green

This is the seventh in a row
I'm awake and barely breathing
In and out the great unknown
The distance singing softly
Calling out
Keeping time
From so far 

I smell a fire burning
Something in me stirs
I'm suddenly nostalgic
For what I'm not quite sure
There's no stillness in my mind
No solace in a dark with no stars 

I sit and watch the autumn colors change
In careful patches leaves are rearranged
The west wind blowin'
Through the window screen
I hope its strong enough to carry me 

It's been a long, long day
For a sad, sad song
How the nights get cold
When the summer moves on
Am I running too fast
Is my heart worn thin
Am I running too fast
Am I chasing the wind

I pretend I have a choice
About staying here or leaving
For the laughter and the noise
The distance singing softly

Keeping time

I wonder where it goes and where it stays

"Jump, Little Children","Scene one
Curtain up
See the couple, coffee shop
Beatniks beating out beebop
Rainy day, skies are gray
But the couple feeling gay
Boy is laughing at her joke
Girl, embarrassed, takes a smoke
She should quit, yes she knows
But she's happy as she blows
Down the cafe, through the bar
Past the hippies and the jars
Of the bean that they drink
Everyday, every week
They should quit, coffee's bad
Makes you crazy, fucking mad
But they say in defense
With a pause for suspense
""It's the stuff of the gods
Sexy smart hot rods!
Roller coaster! Hurricanes!
Super-sonic jet planes!""
They should quit, yes they know
But where the hell would they go?
They're like me, in a bind
Don't you see?
Love ain't blind
I could make a habit out of you
Scene two
Same play
Same people
Different day
In a car with no top
No speed limits, no cops
Girl is driving, she's the queen
In control of this machine
She is talking much too loud
Excited by the sound
They are screaming, buzzing hard
Open road, super car
What they need is some speed
105 is the key
Life is short, so they say
Carpe diem, seize the day
Unlike me, in a bind
I don't get it, love ain't blind
I could make a habit out of you
Scene three
City streets
Buying shit, selling too
Need a fix or some food?
Or some sex? There's a whore
Looking beautiful but bored
Like to drink?
There's a bar
Need a lift?
Take my car
A stop for every whim
Your heart's desire lets you in
In this city, in this scene
At this party you are queen
You're addicted to the lights
To the sounds, to the sights
To the pleasure, to the pain
The hot nights, the cold rain
To the smoke, to the drink
To the buzz, don't think
To danger to the fear
To the speed, it's fifth gear
All the time, night or day
There is no choice, it's just the way
You should quit, yes you know
But where the hell would you go?
You're like me, in a bind
Now you see
Love ain't blind
I could make a habit out of you",Habit

Every night
Lately I've been waking out of urgency
Something I said
Something I did

One black day in ghostly white
For just another sleepless night

I'm always taking the dive
All it takes
Is all I can give
All my waking hours just to see you live
Through this sleepless night

Every night
Patiently waiting in the waiting room

Burning an unbearable fluorescent gloom
Still with both my eyes shut tight

Goodnight to the harbor lights
Goodnight to the city

And stare up at the golden moon

Hot sun in the middle of June
You were there in your peach silk dress
Laughing at me 'cause I was a mess
A tall glass of lemonade
Come on let's go lay down in the shade
It really wasn't that long ago
It really wasn't that long ago
And I can sit here in my rocking chair
Down by the riverside
And I can think about your golden hair
But I'll think about my foolish pride

Lay down your head sweet rosemary
Just you and me and a distant hound
Just one kiss and the sun went down

Close enough to be seen
Far enough to be safe
Sitting down in the lamplight

Hiding out in the moonlight

All alone in a crowd
Firmly set in his ways

A last look, a last chance
Gone away too afraid
And he waits...
And he waits...
And he waits...

Half as much as he did

Every dream that he chased

"Jump, Little Children","""Do you smoke opium?"" he said 
As he opened my wallet on the street 
Please god please can you breathe a little softer 
It's hard enough to stand up straight cause I'm beat 
Don't call your girlfriend on the phone 
There's lots of other numbers you can use 
Get this dial tone off me 

Let's go out and get some coffee 
Caffeine will make you less and less confused
I didn't want to be Chinese 
I just ended up in this part of town 
I'm an entertainer 
And I will try to make you saner 
At least turn your frown upside down 

Her take a look upon my face 
It's dark, I know you can't see at all 
But try and take some notice 
At least try and focus 
Or else you're going to stumble or even fall
There's a man coming from the south land 
Just coming off the fix, the sleeve tricks 

Strike it up if judah sticks 
The brass band, hold hands 
Right across the new land 
Have an accent pay your rent, at least conceal your identity 
Cause it's cheaper when it's free 
The warble in the purple 
And the bubble's in trouble again

I heard there was a murder just upstairs 
I saw the graffiti on the van 
The tears on her cheek, were as clean as a squeak 
A crack in the window and they ran 
Please let me hold you by the belt the fall is at least three stories down 
It's easier I swear, comb your teeth and brush your hair 
A few flights of steps and we're into town

""do you smoke opium?"" he said 
As he offered the back seat of a cab 
If you have no quid, don't you even make a bid 
Don't worry, I'll just put it on your tab 
The yellow of the hood began to roar 
The seat became soft or so it seemed 
Just press it to your skin, and let the fun begin 

The music inside your throat will make you scream
There's a man coming from the south land 
Just coming off the fix, the sleeve tricks 
Strike it up if judah sticks

And snuck across the kitchen floor
And is playing a tune while I'm counting sheep

To the corner milky whites

Spinning in a gravity

Down to where the rain falls
Down where the rain can wash away this high
I feel I've gone
Beyond the edge and falling
Falling like tears that turn to snow
Falling in this vertigo

Leaning from the balcony
Above the interstate
Will I come around too soon
Or will it be too late
Surely there's only one direction I could go at this rate
Down below
I'm in this vertigo

Take me down
Down to where the rain falls
Down where the rain can wash away this high
I feel I've gone

Falling like tears that turn to snow

If I had my way, I woul,d stay up here forever 
And never look down
But surely it will come, 'cause I've always had that feeling 
Of rushing the ground
Rushing the ground

Leaning from the balcony
As if without a care
Wondering should I take the fall
Of should I take the stairs

Take me down
Down to where the rain falls
Down where the rain can wash away this high
I feel I've gone
Beyond the edge and falling

When they pass around the chocolate and the pumpkin pie

Jump5,"I'm sure he must have been surprised 
At where this road had taken him 
'Cause never in a million lives 
Would he have dreamed of Bethlehem 
And standing at the manger 
He saw with his own eyes 
The message from the angel come to life 
And Joseph said... 

Why me (why me), I'm just a simple man of trade? 
Why Him with all the rulers in the world? (rulers in the world) 
Why here (why here) inside this stable filled with hay? 
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl (ordinary girl) 
Now, I'm not one to second guess what angel's have to say 
But this is such a strange way to save the world 

To think of how it could have been 
If Jesus had come as He deserved 
There would have been no Bethlehem 
No lowly shepherds at His birth 
But Joseph knew the reason 
The love had to reach so far 
And as he held the Savior in his arms 
He must have thought...

Everyday is a new day
And I don't have to pretend
All my friends think I'm crazy

When I have the chance I wanna say to you
Wishing I could take back what I put you through
I'll never do it again

And what used to be broken is somehow fixed
It's hard to explain

That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we
We will be together forever

I've got all the time in the world
If you look in my heart
You'll know from the start
That's its all I can do
Not to think about you

I gave you good reason
To walk out that door
Let me tell you I've learned a thing or two

And I'm so amazed at the things you do
Now don't let me go oh no

That opposites attract
If that's the truth then we,
We're meant to be together forever

Junco,"Tu vas t'asseoir ici et tu vas m'écouter, la femme que j'aimais
Tu me l'as fait quitter et je suis devenu cet homme que voilà.
Et te voilà perdue, éperdue de remords pour n'avoir jamais su
Résister à ton corps, tu ne le verras plus cet homme que voilà.

Je vais laisser la place, je plains mon successeur.
Un jour, quoi que tu fasses, tu feras son malheur.
Tu te rappelleras cet homme que voilà.
Je connais ton programme, je vois ton avenir.
D'autres mains te réclament que tu vas faire souffrir.
Tes jolis yeux sans âme me dégoûtent à vomir.

Va détruire le bonheur, fais ton travail sur Terre.
Va faire couler des pleurs, va déclencher des guerres.
Ton joli corps sans cœur, va le vendre aux enchères.
N'attends pas trop longtemps, les rides n'attendent pas.
Ce soir, je voudrais tant que ton dernier contrat
Que ton dernier client soit l'homme que voilà.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Que ton dernier contrat, que ton dernier client soit l'homme que voilà.",Bella Sin Alma
Junction 18,"Hey I know 
That I can't talk to you right now
But I want you to see that I'll never let you down
And I can't stop these things from overcoming me
I have to learn to set you free 

I thought I'd be there for you
Now you're questioning if words I say were true

Stars are in my grasp
The ones you gave me that used to be wrapped all around you
But your voice is gone
And now I'm thinking about the way you looked across that table at me
When we shared a walk down on Massachusetts Street

I thought I'd be there for you
No second chance to tell you things I need to prove
Cast aside and I can feel the sinking
I wish you well 
What's causing me to feel?

I can't stop thinking of the way you looked that Friday morning
The shades were red 
Casting pink across your cheeks
And the way you looked at me with that gleam in your eye
Made me feel that things would be okay
And then you cried and disappeared in autumn days

Three weeks gone 
I'll be happy to move on
I know you want the best
But I want to see you again",Dakota
Junction 18,"We danced for the rain All covered
In silver laughter and gold The hurricane
Swept in and trees were made into forts
Around the yard I can't be withdrawn From
A little ember that burned in me once ago
I can't seem to find it in my jaded wounded
Trapeze of living life

But the little you show me Has kept me wondering
If I was set on the right path Or did I make a big
Mistake so long ago

[Chorus]
Cause all I can feel is..All I can feel is more weight than
Ever before All I can feel is.. All I can feel is blistering
On my bed All I can feel is..All I can feel is more
Weight than ever before All I can feel is..

For years, we were bathed Drowned in all this dirt
That ruins our lives And one day we step up and we
Shake it off with a smile Please work this out Someone
Please tell me who is responsible For letting us grow up
In this hive of bastards and lies and enemies

And the little you've showed me Has rendered me away
And the scars that you gave me Are still repeating, slamming
On my door

But what I can feel is this better day
Woke up to sounds of gulls on the bay
I've gotta make use of this beauty today
'cause it could drag me down..The weight
Could drag me down back to where I began

June Carter Cash,"I got tired of New York City, of its sidewalks and its heat
So I got myself a great big horse and I rode him down the street
And then I hollered, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" and, ""Get 'em up, Scout""
But I suffered aggravation and a great humiliation
So I finally said I'd let the story out

You can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You can't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Well, he broke into a cantor down around ol' Times Square
And my cowboy boots and hat, I left them somewhere way back there
Then he stomped and reared and turned and bucked
And took off to the South
And I slid through Gatsby's Restaurant with his tail stuck in my mouth

But you can't ride a big white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You don't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

Now, down at Gatsby's Restaurant, there's a picture hanging there
Of a petrified Italian with escargot in his hair
And there's a big, white horse rug lying by the door
And I'm washing dishes in the back and sweepin' up the floor

But you don't ride a big, white horse into the front of Gatsby's door
You don't call out, ""Hi, ho, Silver"" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, ""Oh, ouch, help Lord"" and, ""Mama Mia, please""

But she missed her old home town (But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)

Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train (Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store

June Carter Cash,"Well there's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side too
But if you meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life

Oh, the storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear
Clouds and storms will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us, every one, in His care

Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

Down the wilderness road, down the dug road, the old reedy creek road
The road down troublesome, the road through Moccasin Gap

Well, it's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kid with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day
Young Jim Boone's dead, now twenty miles away

Well, if you love your wife and love your baby, man
You better turn that wagon back as soon as you can
Every Injun in them hills has gone berserk
And you never gonna make it to Kaintuck

June Carter Cash,"I will twine mid my ringlets of raven black hair
The lilies so pale and the roses so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale amaryllis and violets so blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh will be gay
I'll cease this wild weeping drive sorrow away
Tho my heart is now breaking, he'll never know
His name made me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through ill and misfortunes all others above
Now another has won him, oh misery to tell
He left me in silence no word of farewell
He taught me to love him, he called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
But I awoke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all faded away

I'll think of him never, I'll be wildly gay
I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will sway
I'll live yet to see him regret the dark hour
He won and neglected the frail wildwood flower",Wildwood Flower

I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

When did she slip away?
When did trouble walk through the door and stay?

And lift you high to heaven

Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.

You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today

June Christy,"What a shame the night is ending, cross my heart I'm not pretending 
You look grand sitting in the moonlight
Oh I'm in love there's no mistaking, can't you see my heart is breaking
Must you go on this lovely June night

It's a pity to say goodnight because I never saw stars so bright 
But if you gotta go home, you gotta go home, give me a goodnight kiss
It's a pity to say farewell because the man in the moon won't tell 
But if you gotta go home,you gotta go home give me a goodnight kiss. 

How's about tomorrow night just you and me 
I'll be waiting for you darling underneath the apple tree

It's a pity to say goodnight because I want you to hold me tight 
But if you gotta go home, you gotta go home give me a goodnight kiss
It's a pity to say farewell because the man up in the moon won't tell, won't tell
If you gotta go home, go home, go home give me a goodnight kiss

How's about tomorrow night just you and me 
I'll be waiting for you darling underneath the apple tree

It's a pity, pity just to say goodnight because I want you to hold me tight 
But if you gotta go home dear, you gotta go home dear, give me a goodnight kiss",It's a Pity to Say Goodnight
June Christy,"Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.
Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road

June Christy,"Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live. 

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live. 

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every 
Day then see the doctor anyway. 

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live. 

I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do
What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.",As Long as I Live
June Christy,"Love is wrong, it sings a hopeless song
It longs for bitter disappointment and tears, and tears
It calls to all that used to be
And it yearns for someone who was tender but untrue

Love is blind, it's helplessly inclined
To bind itself to discontent and fears, and fears
It [Incomprehensible] on nights that might have been
Love needs nothing more to do

My darling, so I hold each little talking
We knew, we knew
Endlessly I unfold each word we've spoken
We two, we two

Love is mad, it's beautiful but bad
It gladly weeps when disillusion appears, appears
And so I cling to yesterday while I'm hopelessly in love
While I'm hopelessly in love with you",The Bad and the Beautiful
June Christy,"I remember you,
You're the one who made
My dreams come true
A few kisses ago.

I remember you, 
You're the one who said
""I love you, too,"" I do.
Didn't you know?

I remember, too, 
A distant bell,
And stars that fell like rain
Out of the blue.

When my life is through,
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all,
Then I shall tell them
I remember you.",I Remember You
June Christy,"I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
Wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky, an April day
That would not dance away

I begged of the stars to throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you",I Wished on the Moon
June Christy,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high,
No armored knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World
June Christy,"Remind me not to find you so attractive
Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand, to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

To be sorry that we met
Although I adore you, remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret
So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you, please remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",Remind Me
June Christy,"I hear music when I look at you;
A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true,
The song is you.",The Song Is You
June Christy,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most
June Christy,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swingin' On A Star
June Christy,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi
A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesi?

Besame tu a mi
Besame igual que mi boca te beso
Dame el frenesi
Qui mi locura te dio
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo ensenarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mi
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Besame con frenesi
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenesi
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazon
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mi
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Besame con frenesi",Frenesi

June Christy,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the Summer night.
The clouds were like an alabaster palace,
Rising to a snowy height.
Each star its own Aurora Borealis,
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of Spring in the air

I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb
Till there is only one thing to say

June Christy,"I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
Tell me please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreamin' of?

It'll be goodbye, I know,
To my tale of woe
When he says hello, so;
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

If it's true that love affairs are all arranged in heaven,
My guardian angel's holding out on me!
So I'm looking for a boy 'bout five foot six or seven,
And won't be happy till I'm on his knee!
I'll be blue until he comes my way,
Hope he takes the cue when I am sayin'

June Christy,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're ev'rything to

Fame if you win it
Comes and goes in a minute
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to
Love is the answer
Someone to love is the answer
Once you've found him, build your world around him

Make someone happy 
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy, too",Make Someone Happy
June Christy,"My ship has sails that are made of silk,
The decks are trimmed with gold,
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold.

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin,
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in.

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring,
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing.

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me,
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me.",My Ship
June Christy,"Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again.
It's been a long, long time.
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since I can't remember when.
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you.
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again.
It's been a long, long time.

Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again.

June Christy,"Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance

Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?

June Christy,"False or true, I wish I had a clue or two
Where I stood I thought I knew
Or should
True or false, life wasn't ever any waltz
Then it caught the somersaults
For good
Might have known it would

Ev'ry Time my heart begins to dance
The world steps on my little toes.
Ev'ry time I take a little chance
I pay right through my little nose.
Ev'ry time I fly my little kite
It catches on a tree.

Ev'ry time I throw an anchor out
It pulls me in the sea.
Ev'ry time I feel a little glow
I always get a little shock.

Ev'ry time I stick my little chin out
I always get a little knock,
And when I aim my arrows at the sun
They always miss their mark

In the dark",Ev'ry Time

June Christy,"I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laughter just the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What, again
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kick the mood
What's in store
Should I phone once more
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

Of course I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

June Christy,"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
June Christy,"Each time I look at you 
Is like the first time

The more I see you, 
The more I want you

Just grows and grows
With every sigh 
I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the Earth below

June Christy,"A corner of the world
A moment out of time
Two people chance to meet
How bitter sweet
How sublime
And clinging there a while 
To gaze across the years
And hope the sun that sets
Brings no regrets
And no tears
And the farewell bow
The lingered kiss goodbye
And who explains the how
And why
These are memories for our time
Two think an escapade
A fly by night affair
Became an interlude
That I've perused
Everywhere",Interlude

Whenever I roam through roses,
And lately I often do,
Funny, it's not a rose I touch,
It's always you!

If a breeze caresses me,
It's really you strolling by.
If I hear a melody,

June Christy,"It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view

But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream

As we dream
A far pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still,
You can hear the grass as it grows

It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me",Lazy Afternoon

Pick ev'ry night to shine.

And why the moon's a watermelon on the vine,

When a bright and early sun begins to steam it up, 
You'll find me underneath the nearest tree, 
Pickin' petals off a daisy while I 
I don't reply to mail that's overdue.

June Christy,"They call me coquette, and mademoiselle,
And I must admit I like it quite well.
It's something to be the darling of all;
Le grande femme fatale, the belle of the ball,
There's nothing as gay as life in Paris ,
There's no other person, I'd rather be,
I love what I do, I  love what I see,
But where is the schoolgirl that used to be me.

Ah, the apple trees,
Where at garden teas,
Jack-o-lanterns swung:
Fashions of the day,
Vests of applique,
Dresses of shantung,
Only yesterday.
When the world was young

While sitting around we often recall,
The laugh of the year, the night of them all,
The blonds who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer;
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight,
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlight memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie;
Looking at the shy,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July,
When the world was young.

You'll see me in Cape D'Antibes , or in Spain,
I follow the sun by boat or by plane,
It's any old millionaire in a storm,
For I've got my mink to keep my heart warm:
And sometimes I drink too much with the crowd,
And, sometimes I talk a little too loud,
My head may be aching, but it's unbowed,
And sometimes I see it all through the cloud

Ah, the apple trees,
And the hive of bees,
Where we once got stung,
Summers at Bordeau,
Rowing at bateau,
Where the willow hung,
Just a dream ago,
When the world was young",When the World Was Young
June Christy,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,

And I brightened at last

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

June Christy,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

",Nobody's Heart
June Christy,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

But they are such a chosen few.

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold

When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny

I've known the thrill of loving you.
And that alone is more than I was created for

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

Don't mess with Bill

He is mine all mine
Don't mess with Bill
I'll say it one more time
Don't mess with Bill

Though I tell myself he wants no one else
'Cause he keeps coming back to me
Now I'm in no position to want competition
I want to be sure as can be

Hear what I say, girls, keep away, uh huh
Don't mess with Bill
No, no, no, no

Leave my Billy alone

'cause to lose in love would hurt so much;
but as I softly walk in my solitude
I searched my heart and found there's a need for you.
And for the first time I feel alone,
'cause I need a love to call my own;

I'll rush into your warm embrace.

June Tabor,"This is a strange affair
The time has come to travel but the road is filled with fear
This is a strange affair
My youth has all been wasted and I'm bent and gray with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me against my dying day?
I took my own provisions, but it fooled me and wasted away
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Oh, where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now and taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth?
They took me to illusion when they promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen, 
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer? 
Why is your heart so hard towards the one who loves you best? 
When the man with the answer 
Has wakened you, and warned you, and called you to the test 
Wake up from your sleep that builds like clouds upon your eyes 
And win back the life you had that's now a dream of lies 
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow, 
You'll win the lover's prize 
This is a strange, this is a strange affair",Strange Affair

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

You haunt me
With dreadful ease

There's no one could be so sad

June Tabor,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
June Tabor,"There's word from the caf?
That the old mans ailin'
His eyes are pailin'
And the weather took his hands
They say the ring on his finger
Was shaped from a bone
From some white man in Missouri
That spilled whiskey on his wife

He has traveled in a sacred circle
And he has traveled on a white man's train
He's killed for hunger his buffalo brother
He's killed for anger and a white man's name

His name was Joseph Cross
And he was raised by the mission
Just one of a hundred Indian boys
That wouldn't tie his shoes
He cried the night his grandpa died
And told him in a vision
""Stay close to the ways of the rattlesnake
Stay close to the ways of the grizzly""

In the 1919
Chill of December
The bear and the rattler
Coil sleepin' hardly breathin'
It's a penny to the kitchen boy
To run get sister Lydia
""Now you tell her that old Indian
Is sleepin', hardly breathin'.""

Someone said it just weren't right
To give him a white man's funeral
Someone said they'd just as soon as not
Float him on down the river
But no one touched the ring
And no one said a thing about his chest
Where it looked like a bear had ripped him
And a rattler kissed his cheek",Joseph Cross
June Tabor,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

June Tabor,"She is watching by the poplars
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes
She is watching and longing and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies

And a song stirs in the silence
Like the wind in the boughs above
She listens and starts and trembles
For this is the first song of love

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the morning dew
Roses are shining in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you

And the roses may die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
That's the rose that I wear in my heart

And the years roll on for ever
Till the shadow veils their skies
But still he loves to hold her hand
And look in her sea-blue eyes

And she sees the road by the poplars
Where they met in the bygone years
And the first song of the roses
Is the last song that she hears

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the morning dew
Roses are shining in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you

And the roses may die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
That's the rose that I wear in my heart

June Tabor,"Last night I heard the screaming 
Loud voices behind the wall 
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call 
The police always come late 
If they come at all 

And when they arrive 
They say they can't interfere 
With domestic affairs 
Between a man and his wife 
And as they walk out the door 
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming 
Then a silence that chilled my soul 
I prayed that I was dreaming 
When I saw the ambulance in the road 
And the policeman said 
""I'm here to keep the peace 
Will the crowd disperse 
I think we all could use some sleep""",Behind the Wall [Live][#]
June Tabor,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

""Oh!"" she said, ""Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!""
""Here"" she said, ""just a kiss to make a body smile!""
""See"" she said, ""I've put on new stockings just to please you!""
""Lord!"" she said, ""Casey can you only stay a while?""

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

""Oh!"" she said, ""I suppose you seldom think about me
""Now"" she said, ""now that you've a fam'ly of your own""
""Still"" she said, ""it's so blessed good to feel your body!""
""Lord!"" she said"" ""Casey it's a shame to be alone!""",Casey's Last Ride [Live][#]
June Tabor,"Saturday night at the Adam Smith Hall
The couples all move to the dance master's call
Tonight they've no problems, no worries at all
The dancing's the dancing tonight

But, oh, Monday morning it comes round too soon
The sound of the flax mill, the beat of the loom
But tonight the band's playing a romantic tune
The dancing's the dancing tonight

Her partner is perfect, he's light on his feet
The footwork is graceful, perhaps they might meet
By chance by the auld kirk or on Hunter Street
On the way to the Adam Smith hall

Walking home late by Kirkcaldy's sea wall
The sea looks so big, the sky is so tall
The fate of two people can't matter at all
Just a waltz in three quarter time",The Dancing

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Why do we meander, huh?
In a zone with hate for peace

Black is black is black is black

Black is black is black is black
Black is black is black is black

Way back when in '68
When brothers didn't have it great
They fought back with civil rights
That scarred the soul, it took the sight
The common foe you plainly see
On the streets or on TV
Segregation was the king
Vietnam was full in swing
Martin Luther had to shout
""Let's get out, get out, get out""
The situation sort of changed
But what really makes matters strange
Is our foe is well disguised
We don't know where our fate lies
Still and all we cannot lack
The fact that black is black is black

Black is black, is black, is black
Black is black, is black, is black

Judged by both my race and color

I need you and you need me
And if not now you soon will see
My light complexion has no meaning
If you think so you're still dreaming
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
There's no time for us to break up
Black is black not blue or purple

Being black is like a circle
Round and round we all will go
Where we end up I don't know, listen to me if you will
Your fantasies will get you killed
Reality is what is real, reality is black is black
I try, try to tell my people,
We all are one, created equal
Before we master, we must plan
Is that so hard to understand?

Today's the day we get together
To try to change and make things better
If not where will we be tomorrow?
Drowning in the pool of sorrow
Daylight shines but still few see
That we must fight for unity
In a picture that's fixed is black and white
Why's it both that have to fight?

One big scratch (that's all I ask for) here we go

Well, I'm a sure shot shooter and I'm the big shot
The big shot, yes the biggest, and I know I'm hot
Say I'm the baddest, just the baddest and I'm on the top
Sucker MC's try to stop me, but I won't stop
As I adjust and discuss all the rhymes I bust
I leave 'em all in the dust when I start the thrust
They try to catch me on the mic, but I'm hard to chase
I'm the ace in the place kickin' rhymes in your face
I'm outright, outstanding, outrageous, I'm smoking
Never play on the mic, no jivin', no joking
Not a double-talker, so I don't double-talk
Ladies clock, finger-pop to the rhythm of a hawk
But I ignore the temptation, avoid the sensation
Reputation's at stake, but I won't break
I just chill (ill) ill, let loose all my skill
I make a list of all the ladies that my skill will thrill

Now, my tasty technique tantalizes your taste
As my rhymes rock and roll right through this place
I never fade away for forfeit or fess
And my beat is a beat bound to be best
Clowns craze and chase me 'cause I'm so cool
As I ridicule the rule and fool the fool
Ignite the party, excite the crowd
I'll make the quietest person wanna go and get loud
I'll make the hot get hotter when I start to rap
And my reward for goin' off is to hear people clap
I'm a monster for music, and my means are to move
Guys and gals'll get gray when it's time to groove
I'm a sexy sucker, but the mind is sane
Having nothing to lose but only goals to gain
By my side, I'm supplied with the best of the best
Sammy B and Shazam which means there's no contest

Well, I'm an MC debater, rhyme regulator
Cool creator, rapper, not a raper
A damn good fighter, party highlighter
Lady exciter, writer, not a biter
Suckers lookin' to me, say, ""what you think they see?""
They see a fresh, fantastic, fly, funky MC
They try to study my style, use and abuse it for a while
'Til I take 'em to court and have 'em put on trial
I let Mike G judge 'em, put 'em on the case
Sammy B, you be my lawyer to put 'em to disgrace
You see, I never have to worry, 'cause they both got my back
Sammy B for the fader, Mike G for the rap

The more suckers I burn, the better suckers will learn
That Mike G is takin' his turn to earn
Havin' the time, the rhyme, I'm gonna get mine
And it pushes the thought of suckers further out of my mind
'Cause as I rhyme to my peep, suckers smoke the cheap
And butlers take down my orders from the words that I speak
Because I'm strong like a horse and loud like thunder
You mess with me, you'll be sixty feet under
In a jungle with a force, on a straight-forward course
And if you don't join the jungle, you should feel remorse (yeah)

Ah yeah, yes yes y'all and you don't stop
You keep on to the break of dawn
You keep on to the break of dawn
You gotta be on time when you bust your rhyme
And you can't be wack when you rap the rap
You gotta get on the mic and do your best
For the people in the north, south, east and west
Like you can't judge a book by it's cover
If you listen, you will learn from a jungle brother

Because there's plenty of fishes out there, in the sea
And I can find another if you don't want to be with me
You said you have a boyfriend, but like you said, he is a boy
I am the real thing, and he is just a toy
Something that you pick up, play with, and put down

You fell in love, you got shot by Cupid
You haunt me and taunt me because my name is worth money

Was it you got blessed, or for one simple kiss
That you could not resist when I threw you the gift?
Let's do this, not just to say we did it, 'cause I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed to do you)
Now you had me pictured as the man of your dreams
But everything good ain't as good as it seems
I might love you and leave you, or tease you then please you
But girl, you're just too good for me to try to squeeze you
The first day I met you I felt as though I knew you
That's why I told you upfront that I was gonna do you

I'm gonna do you, I'm gonna do you

Treat you like a bady, hold you by the hand

Afrika, Afrika, he's biting off of you
He's tryin' to get over, so watch your back""

Jungle Brother, JB for short
A bite a bit my rhyme and we almost fort
But since he was a brother I thought that'd be wrong
So I let him go, I let him run along (Run along)
I write rhymes like I come from New York City
My DJ spin the music down to the nitty gritty
When the downstairs funky five days a week
Searching and seeking for the Baby Bam beat
The African rap that comes from within us
Brothers heard about it now they wish they could've been us
We did an album with no problem
Now we working on another with another Jungle Brother
(Me) Q-tip, his name, he's into business, not into games
So Q-tip when the light turns green
Grab your bone and show them what I mean

My bone is grabbed, this is what I mean
I brag a grab, and here's the scene
Q-tip, (Q-tip) from a Tribe Called Quest
Saw the Jungle Brother's album, oh yes
So get the ducats it's coming out soon
A month after March, two before June
It's nice with Ali Shaheed Mohammed, my DJ who
Is real dominant (Mohammed, Mohammed)
He and I form the funky Tribe
If you want to get with it, just feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Me and Ali are extremely radiant
And to be heard like the horn of Gideon

Get it? If not you're a goner
Get wise or get something, 'cause your going to want to
Lamp, after you hear from me
The Tip from Quest my DJ's Ali
Say it from the Catskills, to the Soho
Listen to the words they say on the Promo
To the bewildered let it be said
I'll mix you up more like DJ Red
So Mike G, when the light turns red
Don't stop, proceed ahead

Go on with your
Go on with your
Go on with your
Bad self
Well, I'm going (Where?)
Straight to the treetop
Eating crazy fruit, so I can't stop
Squating here, listen to the LP
Straight Out The Jungle from the JBs
Baby Bam beat keeps the bass bottom bouncing
Suckers littering, girls ouncing
Women inching, girls pinching
Run to the record store to see if this new inventions in
Remixes, out fixes, we write it, you like it
Rap music, house music
No matter what it is, the JBs can do it

Jungle Brothers,"Educated man, from the motherland
You see, they call me a star but that's not what I am
I'm a jungle brother, a true blue brother
And I've been to many places you'll never discover
Step to my side, suckers run and hide
Africa's in the house, they get petrified
You want to know why, I'll tell you why
Because they can't stand the sight of the jungle eye
They never fight or fuss, they never curse or cuss
And they just stand on the side and stare right at us
They get out of line, I put 'em on a vine
And give 'em one big push for all mankind
There ain't nuttin to it, I just go head and do it
And lay down the jungle sound and run right through it
And when I'm on the mic, I never stutter or stumble
'Cause I'm a jungle brother, straight out the jungle

Cool and quiet, but quick to start up a riot
I write the rhyme, bums assist to bite it
I wear no gold around my neck just black medallions
And sold the home of true black stallions
I don't care for fear 'cause fear fears meat
Out of ten ways of dying, the first might cheat
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest, hard can get
Africa and I, while Sammy be's on the set
I kick the rhyme to the girl and she became my pet
I lend some sucker some juice and now he's in debt
The sucker said he wasn't scared but still in all he sweat
A poor man became rich because some meeky bet
My brother's searching high and low, they'll looking for me
Where will they find me, in the J-U-N-G-L-E

It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

Struggle to live (struggle to live) struggle to survive
Struggle (struggle) just to stay alive
'Cause inside the jungle, either you do or you die
You got to be aware, you got to have the jungle eye
Take it from a brother who knows my friend
The animals and cannibals will do you in
Cut your throat (cut your throat) stab you in the back
The untamed animal just don't know how to act
It's unbelievable (unbelievable) uncivilized (ci-civilized)
And now I'm starting to realize
Danger in the jungle, the jungle means danger (danger)
Tension intense, hearts filled wit anger (anger)
Men killing men just because of one's color
In this lifetime, I've seen nothing dumber
So I think before I make a move
Make sure my rhyme goes along wit the groove
And backing on a brother it's time to rumble
My name's Mike G (Mike G) and I'm straight out the jungle",Straight Out the Jungle
Jungle Brothers,"It's a cryin' shame, brothers takin' life as a game
Growing up against the law, but no one knows who's to blame
Dealin' drugs on the corner, you don't have to, but you wanna
A meal is hard to make, but you tell yourself you're gonna
Dealing 12 to 12, day into evening
I wonder how you continue to be grieving
Your meal is made and it's time to chill
You buy the black Mercedes Benz with the gold to the grill
Cruisin' up the ave while your friends get jealous
You find out, you quickly get restless
You buy a gun, it doesn't help but hurt you
Because your so called friend rattled on you
You're in the pen serving ten to twenty
Your boy snatched your girl and put use to your money
You're out for teen, but what does it mean?
You're just a waste young brother who lost it all on a dream

What's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, what's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

My blood brother is bleeding, it's a cryin' shame
Out on the street tryin' to play the game
Formally an in-mate straight from upstate
Can't stop him now 'cause you see it's just too late
He's on the run and he's got a gun
Stay out his way unless you want some
See, he's gettin' older, a bit more bolder
Got his name written up in the 5-0 folder
A big Christmas list of all the crime's he's committed
He says he didn't do it, but we know he did it
Summons his lawyers, fingerprints, bung shots
Lookin' for my brother, yo, he's at the drug spots
Livin' off that cheap Chinese food
He says he only bumps the people when he's in the mood
Runnin' 'round with his crews and his 2-2's
I saw him last night in the prime time news
Shot and killed by an on duty Jake
His birth to the earth was a big mistake

Now, history was not my favorite subject
I used to flip through the pages and get upset
Seein' little of black and too much of the other
(They tried to brainwash you) Picture that, a jungle brother
Read this, read that, answer question three
But when I got to three, it had nothin' to do with me
Somethin' was wrong, and I knew it all along
Now tell me (please) what's goin' on

What's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Yeah, what's goin' on, I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

Now, I've been told all the do's and don't-do-not's
My mother, hallelujah, she called the shots
She said, ""Don't play with guns and play with knives
And most of all, don't play with other people's wives
When you're walkin' down the street, pay the pushers no mind
Cause all they wanna do is put your mind on cloud nine
Put your head up high and your feet on the ground
You don't have to be like everybody else to be down
Stay in school (don't be no fool)
Don't lose your temper (and keep your cool)
Follow your heart (and not your friends)
And some of your friends (could lead you into dead ends)
The other day my father said, ""son, God bless your soul
Our life is gettin' tougher and the world is cold""
I said, daddy, daddy, daddy, what do you mean?
He said (""you ain't got nothin' 'less you got the green"")
I realize to myself things are gonna be hard
So each and every day I pray to God
I say, now I lay me down to sleep
(I give the Lord my soul to keep)
If I should die before I wake
(Take me to heaven 'cause I need a break)
But if you let me live to another morn'

Do you want to get down?
I wanted to take her home with me
Behind the bush and up my tree
So I blowed and blowed and I kept on blowing
Hey, wait a minute, baby! Where you going?

[Mike G]
Dina! Never should have seen her
Hooked by her look now I feel like I need her
Body so pure, she's shaped like an hourglass
As I turned around I peeped out her megablast
I needed acquaintance cause I had no patience
Drugged (by her bellybutton?) no, by her radiance
The hips did dips so I did flips
The pucker of her lips could sink battleships
The basket's glowing from the diamonds' glitter
If I only had it in me to go get with her
The moment I got it I needed a casket
Cause she blew me a kiss and jumped back in the basket

[Hook]
Belly Dancin Dina!
Boy, you should have seen her
The way she moved her body
All across the dance floor
Tore me all apart, straight to my heart
And it was nothing but a freaky art

[Kool DJ Red Alert]
Live from 113th Street and Seventh Avenue
Straight out the pyramid, we gon bring to you
The live one they call Belly Dancin Dina!

[Afrika]
Well, today's the day, hooray hooray
Yippee yie yo, yippee yie yie yay
Everybody's waiting for her to arrive
Oooh, she makes my nature rise
All dressed up in her sparkling clothing
I might pass out when that basket opens
Ordinarily I'm not the kind who fiends
Could it be her cute little finger tambourines?
I don't know but it's making me hard
(How hard?) Harder by the yard
Thousands of brothers had congregated
Stone boom, waited and waited
They came in peace, they paid their funds

[Kool DJ Red Alert]
OK, Y'ALL HERE SHE COMES!

[Mike G]
I've got to go get her (Word?)
And if you got bananas I'll be glad to betcha
Push back my chair to walk across the floor
As I got closer her body shook more
My eyes were set on her jelly-like belly
And if I'm dreaming don't nobody tell me
People started standing, I started losing sight
And I was really feeling like this was my night
I dipped to one side and then to another
Ahh, I see Dina! Oooh, my brother
I made a quick to dash to put my hands on ­
Poof! Dina was gone...

[Afrika]
Where she disappeared to no one knows
All she left behind were her silky clothes
Smelled the smell of her sweet perfume
Heard a voice say: ""I'll be back real soon""
Say, say, where you going?

[Hook]",Belly Dancin' Dina
Jungle Brothers,"""Breakdown...""
Round and round, upside down
Living my live underneath the ground
Never heard of and hardly seen
A whole lot of talk about the Red, Black and Green
So dirty you didn't want to deal with it
So funky you didn't want to got with it
But that's alright, no problem, cool
Sent to the Earth to educate the fool
Waiting around for my shell to crack
After that you can't hold me back
Looking out for the danger signs
Jungle Bros bringing forth a change in times
Left, right, some ask from which angle
Straight up the middle, reality's the riddle
Sending a message to the old and young
Confused about where I come from
What planet? What channel? What station?
AfriKa from the Zulu Nation...

Confused, no landing, no understanding
But I knew not to give what life was demanding
Found a new tab, thought I'd take a grab
Tired of brothers who feign to backstab
Beating a bigger drum, better days will come
And if they don't come, I'll get up and make some
First you crawl before you walk
First you think before you talk
I found in life that you wear a hard hat
Protect your mind and bad things will stay back
Vultures flocking around on corners
Snakes slide through our law and order
Years slip away and I get older
Leaves hit the ground and it gets colder
My heart pumps faster so I get bolder
That's when I ask my brother to...take over!
My mellow, Uncle Sam!

(Ladies and gentlemen, live from the Planet Rock we have the
J.Beeeeees...)

You see some listen but still don't hear
Some seem far but are real near
I climb a mountain to reach a kingdom
And if they're willing, sure I'll bring them
Think to the needy and then to the greedy
Rely on the heaven and earth to feed me
Move to the motions of the moon
(Take out your shades!) Cause the sun comes soon
To plan my day I look at the sky
I see rain and I still ask why...
Broke the airwaves, trying to make waves
Finally came through but came in mono
Frequencies I kept on fighting
Satelliting what I was writing
Three years, finally got through
Came through in stereo...
So hello everybody and how ya'll doing?
We gonna say a few words and keep on stepping
People watching to see what we would do
Live on air you heard us say to you:

The city's a jungle and we are the brothers
This so-called King Of The Jungle will run for cover
All of your minds have been set into a trance
So instead of fighting out our problems...
We order ya'll to dance!",Beyond This World
Jungle Brothers,"Black Woman, mother of my earth
Black Woman, you gave me birth
You can truly see what's in me
You can help me be the best that I can be
You feed my fire when I'm on the wire
Keepin' me calm when it's gettin' higher
Sweet like sugar and hot like wine
Always keepin' ya on my mind
You're givin' my life a new light to reach for
Giving me so much how could I ask for more
Keepin' us tight when we're gettin' loose
The darker the berry the sweeter the juice

You started out just a little girl
Given the power to change the world
And though some of your ways to man are odd
You are the proof that there is a God
Black Woman ya are the mother of all
Black Woman ya stand so firm and tall
And as you aged mind body and soul
You became more beautiful
You are the Future you are the Wisdom
The Wisdom that the evil Forces tried to hide
But no longer will you be hidden
In my Jungle you will always exist
Your wish is my command
Yo command is my wish
And the job of the Man is to respect
Protect be fruitful and multiply
Honor and love love and honor

The one that gets all the money (all the money)
Yeah, that's right

[Dove]
A fat funky fruit with a whole lot of tang
A little something called ""Doing Our Own Dang""
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bass line so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

[Q-Tip]
A tree is growing
Can't you see what I see? A white blue fruit to boot
We count to ten before we pass the crews, now that's family
Equipped with the brothers and the sisters and the sisters and the brothers
And all others, with the funky flairs, the bugged-out hairs
It's the life of Riley, I'm really ready
Gazing at the dollar fill of rap
The cool June bugs, the wicks, the wacks
Praise the rhythms for what it beez
And praise the Lord for the JB's

We're doing our own dang [Repeat: x4]

[Posdnuos]
Isn't it cool when you cut your hair
And the blood is red instead of sellout green
This is not the music for an R&B mind
This is flower intertwined with a vine
(In other words this is rose)
You see what I mean? Or see what Grandpa Bam saw
Funk we transmit is unstable
One condition if I am able to say
(Yes you may) Well hey, let's get on with it
Vocal confetti is thrown, sometimes spitted
Out the vents of hecklers and fans
Either which way they all hop on the van
The band, the band, here comes the band
The tribe of fingers all on one hand
Me, myself, and I are dark
Monie Love the mouthpiece, it's now yours to spark

[Monie Love]
Sister Monie, the only one here who missed a plane back to London
Residing with my brothers and I learned a lot from them
About the group, how to be smooth and play funky
And sometimes rated it's kind of funky, but it's cool
For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking on and off beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, son)
Don't be mad, be glad I missed the plane, I'm staying
With the Brothers Jungle, Soul, and the Tribe I'm saying
Funky funky rhymes that always stay in swing
I believe we doing our own thing

[Afrika]
Well my family sets all the trends
From soul to soul, large to loose ends
And I all my groups like kill? 
(Cause that's where the money's at)
Yeah, the industry's filled with copycats
R&B mixed with sloppy raps
Tribes like us always open doors
But what for, so you can get yours?
You ain't in to it, all you want is profit
So I ask you please to stop it
Leave me alone, get off my bone
Cause I'm doing my own

[Mike G]
A new seed, a new breed
A new man you to feed the greed
A new pair of boots for a new piece of butt
Sweet daddy are you there? (Sammy be	 is on the cut!)
Spinning back for a rap that's laid back
Read to kic back, those get no slack
I may rock a rhyme or I may start to sing
But still, I'm doing my own thing

In comes the mood of Jungle and Daisies
Play the same and let the vibes grace me
All hold hands and let's walk about
And form a circle and talk about
Don't follow the path that we're stepping
Truth to the soul is what I'm cramming
Reasons for this is that the family's strong
And like Bob Marley said ""We're jammin'""

Hopped on the vine and swung through the city

Brushed my teeth then I carried on
Got myself dressed and off to work
I got there early, the boss was happy
""Hey, good mornin Afrika

Pulled out a check and read out raise
and I be cold vacationed for 60 days
60 days, layin in the shade
And on top of that I'm stone cold paid
Packed the trunk of clothes and funk
Jumped on the plane, now what's my name?
Honey child, you can't tell me nothin
Out in the Motherland for two whole months
and WHOO!  Feelin alright
Uh-huh, feelin alright..

Home from the show and I'm layin back
Pulled an old school tape from out my rack
Tall glass of AJ and a real soft seat
as Pow-Wow rocks a rhyme to Billy Squire, Big Beat

With the morning of the fox, that rocks the box
Expect sunshine today!
For yesterday's rain has faded far away
Now we seek a brand new day, a brand new way
Learn my brothers and sisters, learn

Nighttime fades away, on to the next day
The weatherman predicts a clear sunny Saturday
Relax laid back and feelin' the cool breeze
Positive vibes in sauce and the melodies
Gather my leaves and all my minerals
Fix myself a bowl of vegetables
Ice cold water and chopped up fruits
Gonna be a long day so I throw on my boots
Stretch out my hut and beyond the sun rises
Clouds gather round and suddenly hides it
Doubled back cause it started pourin'
Children scared of the thunder roarin'
Given the light but now there's darkness
Started with intelligence, now there's ignorance
Negative vibes now I don't feel right
I want my sunshine, I want my sunlight
Same old story, over and over

So I fight back with a native dance
Sing my song and chant my chants

Please come back another day
The sun will shine and now the sky is gray
Please rain, go way

I need to cool off so I find me a hydrant
Pull out my wrench and turn on a happy face
See some buckets I think there'll be a chase

Hopin' the feelin', will keep on lastin'

Someone wasn't in the mood for playin' around
The mother cries as she sees her young one 
Victim of a fool while playin' in the hot sun
Kangaroos came and cleared out the area
Covered her up so the sun won't beat her

Real serious
The sun shinin', the guidin' light
The fire that we all attempt to fight
The only thing is you can't put it out
You blow and blow but that makes it grow
Bright around and it was made for me
A gift from God that he gave to me
You eat it and chew it, and then you swallow it
And wisdom is what you get from it
Try to stop me from gettin' mine
And you can kiss me where the sun don't shine

And all is face say why'd have to be this way? 
Five 'cent is the culture 
Make me pop you like a vulture 
Amplify my mic and let the rhyme take the clutcher 
The rains of the rhythms with some boom boom cat 
Not enough to break your back, just so you react. 
My counter act's my counterpart

You made a move to pull my plug now that ass got sparked 
All I seeing and knowing is my business and I divide to multiply 
And give thanks to most high

Overcome the odds is the only decision 
Cast like my pawn with your third eye vision 
Slip up in the brain raise a sharp incision

Dreams of fighting for my freedom in the most high courts 
But jump shots get blocked and dreams get shattered 
And when the day turns night, souls get bruised and battered. 
Cheap labor for a favor from your cotton picking neighbor, 
Got to work your ass off just to show you got flavor, 
Life savers won't help you when your breaking your back 
And Uncle Sam keep talking about raising his tax 
I look at heaven and see myself rolling in seven or eleven 
So I can recoup this suit that I'm spending 
Pray to God with divine intervention all my life 
Repent for my sins because I don't want strife 
Release from contracts to make new contacts 
The game gets played but still remains the facts 
That I got to wake up and see the brood of charades 
'Cause I'm still living in the modern age slave trade 
Rapping on holy water, 
Looking for divine order 
Life goes on, but still the rhyme gets shorter 
Seal my fate, there's no escape 
But still I'm straight, 
I'm back on track, shaking off the dead weight 
The time has come, for me to free my soul 
Grab hold of my heart and take full control

I still stand my ground and use the force of God

Lace up a fattie of the greenery, bounce and check the scenery
Anticipation of the raw fills up the whole vicinity
Legendary quotes from promissory notes
Authentic fatigues wrapped around your throat
Coming hitting like a hammer
My overuse of truthful grammar might send me to the slammer
So I got my alibi, so if the DA try to make me fry
I'll poke him in his eye with a who, what, when and why
Oh no, not I, done hit you up with the jimmy so now identify
Cause whether dollars or yens, the 5-ohs always want to apprehend
A brother for doing his thing

[Afrika]
A yo! Hotshots rock spots and smoke chocolate thai
Talking about getting money till the day they die
Make money money, make money money money
Take money money, take money money money!
Suit getting chunky, well you see my pockets' fat
Enough to go around ten times and come back
Be the A double be	 on the thousand G bill
Circle it around from Brooklyn to Castle Hill
Right from the getty we caught bank from the piggy
Cause we give it to you raw down to the nitty-gritty
People acting shitty when they see me counting fifties
Buying new sneakers, ""Yo, son! Where'd you get these?!""

Recognise by the ?G' at the end of the name
The aroma in the air when I spark a new flame
It was the DJs in the park that put a start to the game
That's what made me grab the mic and go seek fame
And put a shame to the emcees with styles too lame
For the treasures I lust but I fall short of, In God We Trust

Jungle Brothers,"[ VERSE 1: Mike G ]
Remedies for house parties stayed simple and plain
Little wine, little music, little Mary Jane
Gotta keep the lights dim, so when the people walk in
The vibe stays nice and mellow, everybody fits in
And everybody hey and ho, are gettin they groove on
The record only stops when the lights came on
Then they went back off, we continued to groove
Then somebody grabbed the mic like they had somethin to prove
It was just the spirit got em, it wouldn't let loose
There right before our eyes hip-hop was produced
The fire kept on burnin like a doggie in heat
You couldn't help to feel the flavor as you walked through the streets
Everybody had a crew on every block for blocks
This seemed to be insurance that the beat won't stop
So one day shots ring and it was no one to blame
All you thought was would it ever all be the same
But if you got the love, baby, won't a damn thing change
As long as you remember it always remains

[ CHORUS: The Holmes Brothers ]
I remember
When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang

When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang

[ VERSE 2: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Block parties jam-packed, the first time I heard rap
And deejays spinnin breakbeats back
These were the last good days of the ghetto
It wasn't all about bein jiggy, so save that rap for Jell-O
Down on my knees in the street playin skelly
Rushin upstairs to see _Graffiti Rock_ on the telly
With one eye on the beats droppin
I knew that one day would come when I'd be on the mic rockin
Every day after school practisin
I mixed blues smarts with street smarts, and then started battle rappin
But for me it wasn't happenin 
So I changed up my style, to the ladies been mackin
I wrote a rhyme about 'Roxanne, Roxanne'
I used to bust it out when I went to a jam
My mother read the dirty rap
She said, ""You ain't gon' go too far expressin yourself like that
Disrespectin black women
And what's gon' happen when you turn around and try to have your own children?""
So I changed up my style once again
So me and my moms could still be friends
My daddy wasn't buggin out so far
Watchin me pretend to be another rap star
Through my eyes he saw a child changin
Growin up to be a man and leave behind the shootin, bangin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Now this one goes out to the ones who set it off
And all the pioneers that made it what it was
Cause we been doin this for 25 years long
So we gotta represent and keep hip-hop strong
JBeez, we on a plateau, ain't nothin stoppin us
Will with the spirit of God, now watch it jump in us
Cause when you cut the roots off the family tree
All you leave behind is the sweet memory
Right from the start, we did it in the park
It wasn't for the money, and it came from the heart
But in these days and times, when rappers write rhymes
All we think about is signin on the dotted line
Me, I been thinkin about the way it used to be
When before you was a rapper, you became an MC
I'm proud of my heritage, and glad that we made it
I still bust rhymes without bein player-hated
Standin on the same stage, rockin with the JBeez
Was a dream come true for a brother like me
Before rap was consumed, and hip-hop was doomed
I was bangin on tables, rhymin in the lunchroom
I used to walk the street with my ghetto blaster
My brothers on the block was startin Zulu chapters
You know what I'm talkin about if you go way back
And yo, big ups to all my sisters, in the name of rap
Cause when it comes to hip-hop, you know you gotta keep it true
Take from the old, mix it with the new
I used to go by the name of MC Shazaam
But now you know me as Afrika Baby Bam

Junior Boys,"When the day is over, where could you be?
Do you look past the lights and think ""where is he?""
When I'm not around how do you relate to the night in front of you and the things we never say?

My feelings, they grow
But I never regret you
When I'm not around, will you let me know, keep me on my game, don't let your feelings show?

Through the streets I'm always near
Right through the edge of the night

And the phone never rings
The nights are endless things

You're like a child that cries
And no one heeds the crying
You're like a star that dies
And seem to keep on dying

You can't believe a love like hers

She says that I'm quite a flirter
But I've been a good boy all of the time
And I wouldn't do nothing to hurt her

She'll tan my hide for spending the night
With Betty Lou or Alice
But I'm sleeping alone in this wreck I own
I broke down South of Dallas

When I stumble home at the break of dawn
She better not be suspicious
'Cause I'm about at the end of my rope
And she better not act too vicious

I'm a-covered in grease from my head to my feet
Hands are cut and callous
I spent all my bucks on a broke down truck
I broke down South of Dallas

I'm a happy guy when the miles go by
There ain't too much that I'm missing

Junior Brown,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be

The more semi crazy I get

Junior Jazz,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

Where you were supposed to be woy I saw a note instead
When I open it up now lord this is what it read
Bye bye baby bye bye you know I love you and that's no

But I found myself another bonafide
Everything I want he can buy
Never wanna cry never wanna shed no tears
But when I look upon them wasted years
I got to say why baby why baby why

You took my sunshine away, you took my sunshine away
And darkness cover my head and it rain and it rain
You took my sunshine away
Why you took my sunshine away away

Took down your pictures off the wall I took them down
Don't wanna see your face at all at all
But the scent of your perfume lord still lingers in the
Room
Overwhelming and taking control
Is there no escaping lord the memory of you oh no
Search search high and low, search everywhere that I
Know you go
Calling your friends the ones I know
Telling them to tell you that I won't let go
Never wanna cry never wanna shed a tear
But when I look upon them wasted years
I have to say why baby why baby why

You took my sunshine away, you took my sunshine away
And darkness cover my head and it rain and it rain
You took my sunshine away
Why you took my sunshine away away

Now tears gonna be on my pillow
I a weep like a weeping willow
My heart you dash it through the window
Now I am lonely lonely lonely now
This is the thanks I get for loving blindly
I was so lost no one could find me find me
I never saw it coming coming

I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the reali' with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin'' nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme

You want to be my main squeeze baby
Don'tcha, you want to gimme what I need baby
Won'tcha, picture life as my wife just think

Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say youse the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?

Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard now, niggaz press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick up jooks
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you want to be my main squeeze nigga
Don'tcha, you want to lick between my knees nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin your third down the Ave.
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs lick shots in the air
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere

Pull out your nine, while I cock on mine
Yeah what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you want to buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up, for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin', ""I apologize""
Is you wit me? How could you ever deceive me
But payback's a bitch motherfucker, believe me
Naw I ain't gay this ain't no lesbo flow

I'ma tell you how I want it, ahead of time
Lettin you know, Cease ain't givin no dough
All you get is the sneak preview, the freak show
Some La, last some mo, head to go
I don't need dough to own that ho, you get it?
Anotha nigga never will I owe, you get it?
In the video, the five we flossin in it
How I know every one that you had was tinted
Admit it, six O-O see me in it
Sunroof open, I'm smokin, haters rock wit it
Bithces cluckin, hopin they could go for a ride
Get a lady by my side, when we puff La
If a nigga try me, shit, rather die
She said her favorite song was, Ebony and I
The dick make em happy, I'm they baby daddy
Flossin in the 6 yeah, me and Puff Daddy

[Chorus]
Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse2]
Ey yo, when my nut drop it's gon be sweet as candy
I'm so for real, that's why them bitches can't stand me
Cease a Lee, nuttin sweet, real nasty, and classy
My Iceberg pants, they stay saggy
Black Navy, I fuck hoez 'cause they nag me
That was back when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now my nigga Blake gettin head in the Kitchen
I'll bust off and get to missin, listen
If you ain't a freak, I don't need ya
I want a real bitch, that suck a dime out a parkin meter
Read the scripture
When I stroke, It's like I'm in a picture, Kodak
I love a bitch wit a pussy clean like, Flo-jack
I'm stuck in 86, still call my dick, my Balzak
Too young, stick it in these hoez know that
You want to stay or roll?
Here's a .9 here hold that
Bust up on yo face, lips, tits and all that...

I said Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play

Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse 3]
Yo, when the smoke is gone who they focus on?
When you hear the Mafia, a nigga know it's on
Call me Cease A Leo or Cease a LeLO
Long as me and Rock fuck bitches by the trio
Put that on my nigga B.I.G, Never will I be no
Cat ridin around in a nast ass Geo
Not even a year in the game, getin the range
And hoez give me head just for hearin my name

Why should I have a bitch when I could see yours?
Before you start some shit, be sure

And I got a easy livin, fuck easy women

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:

You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;

Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,

It's a good thing or it's bad,

Love is tearful or it's gay.

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

You've made me break a many true vow

Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.

Come on, honey, let's spend the night together.
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further.

Piercing me right through the core

Time passes much too quickly
When we're together laughing

I wish I could sing it to you, oh no
I wish I could sing it to you
Oh woh, oh woh, oh woh, oh woh
Oh woh, oh woh, oh woh, oh woh

Mostly I'm silent, silent
Never think of the right words to say
When I kiss you
I feel a thousand different feelings
Color of chills
All over my body
And while I feel them
I quickly try to decide which one
I should try to put into words, oh no
Try to put into words
Oh woh, oh woh, oh woh, oh woh
Oh woh, oh woh, oh woh, oh woh
Mostly I'm silent, silent

Silent
Only the beginning of what I want to feel forever
It's only the beginning of what I want to feel forever
Only the beginning, only just a start
I've got to get you into my life, Mama
Got to get you next to me

Only the beginning, only just a start
Only the beginning
Only the beginning
Only the beginning",Beginnings
Junip,"I keep asking myself 
How it came tumbling down down down down down

Let's lock into place like a puzzle
Resolving all my troubles whirling around

And it left me wondering
Should I jump into this
Head first or feet first

And it left me wondering
Should I jump into this
Head first or feet first

And I thought to myself
Would things ever calm down

You pick me up from my maze
And show me the whole world up from the clouds

I'm on my way back should it be head first, or feet first

Head first, or feet first",Head First
Junip,"What would you do
If it all came back to you?
Each crest of each wave
Bright as lightning

What would you say
If you had to leave today?
Leave everything behind
Even though for once, you're shining

Standing on higher ground
When you hear the sounds
You realize its just the wind
And you notice it matters who and what you let under your skin

If put to the test
Would you step back from the line of fire?
Hold everything back
All emotion set aside it

Convince yourself
Someone else
Hide from the world
Your lack of confidence
What you choose to believe in
Takes you as you fall
Takes you as you fall

No one else around you
No one to understand you
No one to hear your calls
Look through all your dark corners
You're backed up against the wall
Step back from the line of fire

What would you do
If it all came back to you?
Each crest of each wave
Bright as lightning
Do the same as you

What you choose to believe in
Takes you as you fall

No one else around you
No one to understand you
No one to hear your calls
Look through all your dark corners
You're backed up against the wall
Step back from the line of fire",Line of Fire
Junip,"Wherever you look,
It's always the same,
So many people,
And the same game.
 
I didn't imagine,
We would end up here,
Now that it's fading,
And I feel so clear.
 
Wherever you look,
It offers the same,
So many people,
Living the same way.
 
I didn't imagine,
We would end up here,
When our petals have fallen,
And I feel so clear.
 
If it's alright with you,
Then it's alright with me,
And I feel so clear.
 
Wherever you look,
It offers the same,
So many people,
Playing the same game,
 
I didn't imagine,
We would end up here,
When our petals have fallen,
And I feel so clear.

Never mind who started it
Never mind what kept you going now
Look how you're dancing now
Look at how we're dancing now

Boy, you know it's true
But you can't stay here
You had it coming for years

Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

It's over now
You've been taking your time
But you can't stay here

Stand up or enjoy your fall
It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

Can't stand to see you cry

No point in looking back
Over your shoulder
Leave your worries behind
For a while
You'll forget everything
As you get older

It's your life, it's your call
Stand up or enjoy your fall

Junius,"Lightning proclaims! The Earth is in flames
Violence begins as our gods ascend
Thrown on a pyre, it's mythos inspired
Fading away, the prophet, the sage

God damns us to fire, and my lie will wash over you

We're born into this foul design
We take it with ease, you know it's not right
The needing to know, it's a common desire
They're feigning control, conspire
Why deny? You know you feel it

The old erratics, the ghosts in static
You know not, what you call out
More fire! Wade out to the grey

As we roam, a shore is shown
It ushers in the fearless and the meek

Don't you see? We're searching on shorelines
We'll stoke the fire, but ignore the tide
It's failed
To rise

Look up! The force! The calm! The storm!",The Antediluvian Fire
Junius,"""And if I transgressed, and went into many fields of science and humanities, 
It was not because I was born a rebel. I was coerced to trespass""

""The belief that we are living in an orderly Universe, 
That nothing happened to this Earth and other planets since the beginning,
That nothing will happen 'till the end, is a wishful thinking that fills the textbooks
And your textbooks are still of Victorian vintage.""

Why do we call for a sun's rise?
When the raining of fire will atone
Born on the floor, it's our birthright
Facing the spires of control

The belfry calls out to our fathers
To lead us all down to our knees
Silence is bred with conversation
The chimes ring out our defeat

(You know that we try hard)

God dares, waits, oh!
My fate wakes, oh!",Birth Rites By Torchlight
