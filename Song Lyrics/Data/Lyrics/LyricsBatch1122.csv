Robert Mitchum,"Let me tell the story, I can tell it all;
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol.
His daddy made the whiskey, the son he drove the load;
And when his engine roared they called the highway ""Thunder Road"".

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis town.
The Revenuers chased him but they couldn't run him down.
Each time they thought they had him his engine would explode.
He'd go by like they were standing still on ""Thunder Road"".

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they swore they'd get him but the devil got him first.

It was on the first of April, Nineteen-Fifty-Four
The federal man sent word he'd better make his run no more.
He said ""200 agents were covering the state;
Which ever road he tried to take they'd get him sure as fate.""

'Son' his daddy told him, 'make this run your last.
The tank is filled with 100 proof; you're all tuned-up and gassed.
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through.
I'd rather have you back again than all that Mountain Dew.'

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they swore they'ed get him but the devil got him first.

Roaring out of Harlan; revving up his mill.
He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville.
With G men on his tail light; road block up ahead,
The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread.

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike,
Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike.
He left the road at 90; that's all there is to say,
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day.

And there was thunder, thunder over ""Thunder Road"",
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load.
And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst.
The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first.",Ballad of Thunder Road [*]
Robert Mitchum,"I'm(D) prayin' for a [G]rain in Cali[D]fornia
    So the grapes will grow and I can drink more [A7}wine
But I'm [D]sittin' in a [G]honky in Chi[D]cago
    With a broken heart and a [A7]woman on my [D]mind
I matched the [A7]man behind the bar for the [D]jukebox
    And the music takes me back to Tennes[A7]see
When they [D]ask, 'Who's the [G]fool in the [D]corner [G]cryin'
    I say that little ole [A7]wine drinker me
I came here last week from down in Nashville
    Where my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
    But in Chicago, a broken heart is still the same",Little Ole Wine Drinker Me
Robert Mitchum,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee! 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China,

Robert Mitchum,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me
Robert Mitchum,"The tender grass of spring time
Rose to grain with summer's heat
The orchard blossoms ripen
Into fruit so round and sweet
 
As with nature in her garden
So it is with all and one
Love may blossom in the spring time 
But it blooms with summer sun

As with nature in her garden
Full with light the days are long
Softly evenings pass together
As we sing a summer song 

A vinyards fragrant blossoms 
Swell with grape on summer vines 
Is the choice of sweetest juices 
For a rich and warming wine

As with nature in her garden
So it is with all and one
Love may blossom in the spring time 
But it blooms with summer sun

As with nature in her garden
Full with light the days are long
Softly evenings pass together
As we sing a summer song 

As with nature in her garden
Full with light the days are long
Softly evenings pass together
As we sing a summer song",Summer Song
Robert Morse,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!",You're the Top [From Anything Goes]
Robert Mosci,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me
Robert Mosci,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Robert Mosci,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again
Robert Mosci,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top",Straighten up and Fly Right
Robert Mosci,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map

And then you wonder how it all came about
It's too late now there's no gettin' out
You fell in love, and love is the tender trap",(Love Is) The Tender Trap
Robert Mosci,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You
Robert Mosci,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",Summer Wind

Robert Mosci,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

From a whisper in the wind
To a loud scream
The message came
That I'd lost you
To the warmth of another man

I've seen more tears fall from your eyes
Than all the showers of April
I took kindness for granted
As if it came with the wallpaper

So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason, I just thought you had to be there
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love

I simply must have been crazy
Or I must have been out of my mind
For me to overlook the need in you
Tell me, how could I have been so blind

Never giving thoughts to your wants and needs
Now I'm begging you please
Oh my love
Oh my love

So inconsiderate of how much you cared
For some stupid reason, I just thought you had to be there

I know I'd never fool you in a million years
A horn section you resemble and your figure makes me tremble

I could not resist you and I won't if I can
You're so unexpected and whatever you injected made me feel how I felt when I sang

Hey, hey Julia you're acting so peculiar

Robs me of my sleep and I've forgotten the date

And she does a dance so rhythmically
She's a crying and a singing

But don't that cocaine tree look fine

But you gotta put on your sailin shoes
Put on your sailin shoes
Everyone will start to cheer
When you put on your sailin shoes

Doctor, doctor, I feel so bad
This is the worst day I ever had
Have you this misery a very long time?
Well if you if, Ill lay it on the line

Is a precious thing

And so hard to give in to

It's a path to be taken
Even sleep can turn cruel
When your heart's confused
Whether we spend our lives together
Or we never see each other again

The times that we both knew
Baby your love is here
Is mine with you?

In the deep of our eyes
We just wait to be taken
Sometime's we've been mistreated
By the love we gave
Honey we're not pretenders

The tables turn on us
All those sweet lies, tear away the covers

And now we know not to underestimate
What hearts can do
You keep an eye on me
I?ll keep an eye on you

We tell sweet lies, fooling one another
We gain a fake upper hand
We get outsmarted when we rediscover
We underplay

You took me in, I never minded
You broke the rules, I saw through you then

What a surprise when we turn into lovers
We never guessed it could be
All those sweet lies, tear away the covers
The tables turn

We tell sweet lies, fooling one another
We gain a fake upper hand
We get outsmarted when we rediscover
We underplay

Robert Palmer,"Say you'll write your story
Pictures, dreams and letters
Get your past existence off your mind
Life is such a miracle
Every day brings changes into your life

You could easily
Tell her you know the melody
You could get over her
You keep consoling her
Like in a black and white movie

If you miss your aeroplane
And you've got nowhere else to call
Just hearing your romantic schemes
Can set my heart to thundering
I long to see your bright and smiling eyes

Babe, the stars are sparkling in your tears
You'd better take my handkerchief
And dry your eyes
Love is such a miracle
Every day brings brand new life

Why hesitate?
Why compromise?
You're a friend of mine

Suddenly, I am here with you
I won't get over you
I want control of you
You'll have to make your own move

Once I get hold of you
I won't let go of you
I'll miss my aeroplane too

I'll miss my aeroplane too

You know that I love you
And what love endures

Think it over - what's to lose? 
All the odds are in your favour
Play your cards right - no excuse
You know life is what you make it 

Scared to move case you get shortchanged
But nothing venture, baby - nothing gained 
Take a gamble with your heart 
Take a chance on happiness 

Toss a coin or turn a card 
Time to give those blues a rest
Play for keeps - bet your life
I see loving in your future 

You'll never know if you don't try 
Missionary or kama sutra? 
If there's room for you to improve
There's only one thing left for you to do

Take the plunge - leap in the dark

I think they'd best wait in line

I'm in the eye of a hurricane
I wait for mountains to fall

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Force of will or force of nature

They don't make them like you no more
Bye, bye for now, I'll check you later
See you in a week or two

I can't get enough of you
I won't settle for less than you, girl
Because only the best will do, girl

O.K., so you ain't no saint, but I think you're heavenly
And I appreciate the rumours came from choreography
Last night when you came through the door
I swear I saw the wings you wore
And even though your halo slipped
I thank my lucky stars for you

And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap

She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap

I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?

When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me

Tell me now, I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or go

For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Woo woo woo 
Woo woo woo
 
Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy, I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just can't let you say goodbye

Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo

Consumed by fire in your eyes

Robert Plant,"My love is in league with the freeway
It's passion will rise as the cities fly by
And the tail lights dissolve in the coming of night
And the questions and thousands take flight

My love is miles in awaiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
In the secret that burns and the pain that won't stop
And it's fueled with the years

Leading me on (leading me on)
Leading me down the road
Driving me on (driving me on)
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding and women
Red eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing and my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while and decide

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror still expecting their prey
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back
No
There is no turning back

On the run

My love is in league
With the freeway
Oh with the freeway
And the coming of the night time
My love
My love
Is in league with the freeway",Big Log

In the fireworks, away from the heat
Behind closed doors, away from the street
No-one is listening, at least that's what you think
Cause a slow fuse burns, much faster than you think

Like the new look, all that matters
Through the last one, back in the shadows
Purple each one (leaf swam?), yellow
Silver his wound, and don't touch gold
Dance through the colored razzamatazz

Spin alone desert affairs

Now watch her ways (Watch out, reckless)

Will wear your mind out (The way you wind up)

Robert Plant,"Had a dream last night Didn't come as a surprise
When I woke up wet with the moon in my eyes
Just the same old dream Like the one before
But this time I thought you were there for sure
I've been caught red-handed, I don't know what I'm gonna do

So when I wake, every night it's the same
Just lying there staring and confused yet again
And it's when I do that I fumble in the dark
For the line or the light from the tear in my heart
Here it comes again, oh, looking for you

And here it comes again And here it comes again
Now I've carried the torch I've uncovered the flame
But the friend I'd meet, it must have known me
Had a dream last night didn't come as a surprise
When I woke up wet with the moon in my eyes

Here I am, here I am again, looking for you oh oh oh
Here it comes again and here it comes again

Pat Boone might come along and take Daddy's blues away
Ma might take Daddy's head into her hands

I shivered and shook, Lord I stood just waiting to chase the fall
I wondered how my time would be when spring comes round once more

I face the wind, I have no choice, but you must guard the heart
And cast adrift from those I love, alone I drag my heart

It's only love, in the colors of the shade

Laughing swirling high above the ground
People stop and check and watch her coming
Crazy little mama going round and round
Last time I touched her she was burning
Through a heat of ever lasting light
Drifting through her fires my ceaseless yearning
Flaming little mama will you burn all night
Hey, will you burn all night
Hey will you burn all night

The first time I kissed her I surrendered
Hands reached for the sky no disgrace
Safe inside my love so warm and tender

One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below.

And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade.
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food.

One more cup of coffee 'fore I go

Like your mama and yourself.

And your pleasure knows no limits

Mysterious and dark.

I had of you
Would you care?
And would you now come through?

Take me far away
My wiles and mind can't beat a dream of death today
Hard to get by
When what greets my eye takes my breath away

In my dream you are around the stars
I watched your walls all fall away
You were bare of thoughts; we were to part
And we stayed that way

Some try to hide
Because they lied
They were not true
And they were afraid

They refuse to see
Or be free, be one to gods, they prayed
Cryin', save me, save me!
Save me, save me, save me!
I'll save you; can I spend you?

And now this naked dream
I had of you

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks,
Touch me not, touch me not,
come back tomorrow,
Oh my heart, oh my heart
shies from the sorrow

I am troubled at the tide,
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with Death my bride?

Robert Plant,"The day was old, the light was dim, as I stepped through the door
And all my friends were gathering that day that I recall
I shivered and shook, Lord I stood just waiting to chase the fall
I wondered how my time would be when spring comes round once more

I face the wind, I have no choice, but you must guard the heart
And cast adrift from those I love, alone I drag my heart
Against the cry of ""why?"" I turn my back to go
But out beyond the tears somewhere, someone I need to know

It's only love, in the colors of the shade
It's only love, in the colors of the shade

Old photographs were fading dim - my seed will tell it all
And by the fathers' fathers' hands such pain on all was raw
They read the signs without surprise of how they knew it well
And in the mirror still I see the man, who came from hell

It's only love and the colors of the shade
It's only love, in the colors of the shade
It's only love, in the colors of the shade",Colours of a Shade [*]

Robert Plant,"The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers 
Inside a rain-drenched forest
But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel
The way I felt before 
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more 
The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground she walked upon
Those were good days
The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn, spring and summer 
And winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon
That's where she is
But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel 
The way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away 
That I might bleed some more
The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight 
And she walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves
Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten",Last Time I Saw Her [Remix][*]

Robert Plant,"Once in Persia reigned a king
Who upon his regal ring
Etched a caption true and wise,
Which, if held before his eyes,
Gave him counsel at a glance
Fit for every change and chance.
Solemn words, and these are they,
""Even this shall pass away.""

Trains of camels through the sand
Brought him gems from Samarcand,
Fleets of galleys through the seas
Brought him pearls to rival these,
But he counted not his gain
Treasures of the mine or main,
""What is wealth?"" the king would say,
""Even this shall pass away.""

In the revels of his court,
At the zenith of his sport,
When the palms of all his guests
Burned with clapping at his jests,
Amid his figs and wine,
He cried, ""O loving friends of mine,
Pleasures come, but not to stay,
Even this shall pass away.""

Towering up above the square,
Way up high into the air,
Rose his statue, carved in stone.
All disguised, all unknown,
Gazing at his sculptured name,
Asked to himself, ""What is fame?
Fame is but a slow decay,
And even this shall pass away.""

Sick and tired and fading,
Thinish, beat and old,
Stood a mile outside the Gates of Gold,
Speaking with his dying breath,
""Life is done, so what is Death?""
Then, in answer to the king,
Fell a sunbeam on his ring,
Blinding light through fading grey
""'Cause even this shall pass away.
Even this shall pass away.
Even this shall pass. 
Even this shall pass away.""

I set myself to find
I swore to my love I would
Bring her there

The promises so easily made
Unbearable, yet binding

She does as she please
If ever she leaves
I'll strangle upon my sorrow

Oh me, oh my
Who's gonna mark my time
Oh me, oh my
Who's gonna mark my time

The road is past, tomorrow the sky
Between sometimes is blinding
Someday soon when I turn to cloud
I will fly on her wings somehow
Wrapped in the road and filled with above
The ground seems to fade away
Hold to the earth like a newborn child
Pray she returns someday

Once I was set up upon by thieves
You know they stole my heart away
I finally found it in your arms

And run naked in the fray
And if I bare my soul in asking
One day she'd care for me

And I was cast out on the ocean
Adrift to count the seven seas
So all alone, so high and lonesome

THE PAINT IS CHIPPED AND CRACKED A LOT
SOME PEOPLE THINK SHE'S SHOT

Sittin' in the jail house
Hoping there'll be no break of day
Prison warden do I get that pardon
I'm  betting my life for a stay
I see through your bars the hangman and his guards
The preacher man all coming my way
  
Trouble started when a woman
Began making eyes at me
Round sexy hips silky hair and ruby lips
And she was wild and she was bad
All in a flash I was in a clash
Another man died by my hand

Hey bitty ya ya hey bitty ya ya day
Hey bitty ya ya hey bitty ya ya day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Chase tomorrow's hope for peace
Chase your needs, fragile leaves
Chase nothing â??till its seen
It's black and white, it hides, free

Keep it in your faith, never chase the blame
Keep it in your soul, never lose your cool
Keep it in your name, and from those afraid to chase....Dreams

But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back 
To bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.",Heart Attack

Robert Stanton,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

There's a brand new day in sight
At that time: round about midnight

Life's game of chance
And you're one of the minor players
Look for what you lost
For days to come, harbour some
Let your spirit start the fight
At that time: round about midnight

Every day's going to bring some sad times
Every day's going to bring some glad times
So take what you can of the glad times
Don't measure your pleasure
In nickels and dimes

Look back on today and you'll know
When you have been unhappy
Tears done, chased away
What might at night have their day
Let your eyes put out their light
At that time: round about midnight
Round about midnight",Round Midnight

Knowing neon nights, and missing all the stars

Drinking up the night, trying not to drown

All the sad young men, singing in the cold
Trying to forget, that they're growing old

All the sad young men, choking on their youth
Trying to be brave, running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold, slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old, that's the cruellest part

Someone they can hold, for just a little while

Tired little girl, does the best she can

To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
To fight for the right, without question or pause
To be willing to march into Hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm

You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her

Maybe this time it well work out alright
Maybe this we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again

Warm sleepy morning working up next to you
Feeling you close by side
Nothing on earth has ever felt better
Then the feelings I've felt deep inside
Sometimes it seems that I never lost you
And that your not really gone
Cause I had this dream

Walked like you do, I thought it was you
And as he turned the corner I called out your name
I felt so ashamed, it wasn't you, wasn't you

You are everything, everything is you
You are everything, everything is you, you
You are everything, everything is you

How can I forget when each face that I see
Brings back memories of being with you?
I just can't go on living life as I do, comparing each girl to you
They just won't do, they're not you

And you are everything, everything is you
You are everything, everything is you
You are everything, everything is you
You are everything

And something happens to me
When it's you that I see
When it's you that I feel
Everything is so real, so real

Say that you need me all the time

In an empty painted room
In a window box for two
I spend the lonely days
Hoping you'll come back to stay

And thought the cloudy haze of smoke and romance
Hope got in my eyes
Love had played me
Left and made me into nothing at all

'Cause I got all caught up in love
I sold my heart all because
Thought I never wanted too
Love convinced me to change my attitude
And I'm living only to say I'm lonely all because of you

This feeling is never ending
Wanting for you, knowing it's no use
My broken heart won't be mending
Long as you stay so far away
I'll still be the same 'cause

Actors have their lines

Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

He sang  as if  he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words

Roberta Flack,"Here close to our feelings we touch again
We love again
Remember when we thought
Our hearts would never mend
And we're all the better for each other

There's more to love, I know
Than making love

Here no more confusion, we see our lives
We live our lives
Remember when we thought
We never would survive
But now neither one of us is breaking

There's more to love, I know
Than making love

Some things never change
Some things sometimes do

And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in
And now neither one of us is breaking
Now we know there's more to love
Than making love
And I'll remember you and making love
And I'll remember you

And I'll remember you
And I'll remember you
And I'll remember you",Making Love
Roberta Flack,"Just when I thought my life was over
And that I was through with love
You came along
I found in you something beautiful 
And I'll never give it up
You're the reason I go on

You are a dream and I'm dreamer 
But I just can't get enough
Cause a dream takes so long 
If we should ever use this magic 
Where we need it just for love
And what we have made us thought 

When we will long
And i see that look in your eyes
I'll realize that you're something wonderful
I can't believe you are so alive
And it seems that love was made just for us

You mean so much to me
More than everything
I never wanted go
And now I'd give the world to you 
If i could put it on a street for you
Yes, I would
This is what i mean before
You are everything and more

More than everything to me",More Than Everything
Roberta Flack,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

And I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

Things are hot here now they say,
There's a new gal in town.
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt.

Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say;

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown. 

All you gals will get the blues, 
All you pals will surely lose.
And, there's but one excuse.
Now I've told you who she was, 
And I've told you what she does,
Still, give this gal her dues.

Comin' closer, dark and rainy skies disappearing

Roberta Flack,"Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Unhappy faces behind a painted smile
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style
Unhappy people living in sin and shame
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game
And we're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Young girls who'll soon become
Streetwalkers in the night
Young boys, the restless breed
Looking for a fight
Children both rich and poor
They're searching for the truth
And if they don't find it
God help tomorrow's youth
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me
While all around me what do I see
Hatred and jealousy
Brotherhood is dying
Love is the answer
Nobody's buying
Good people turning bad
Some don't but they are few
The winds are blowing
The choice is all up to you
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Yes we're caught up in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time
And we are riding on the trade winds
The trade wind of our time

We're caught up
Caught up in the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

We are riding
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

We're caught up
Caught up on the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

And we're riding
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

We are riding, yes we're riding
Trade wings of our time

We're caught up
Caught up in the trade winds, trade winds of our time

Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Roberta Gambarini,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide

I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire

And every time your lips meet mine

That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you

Day in and day out

I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

Molhando a poeira que estava no chão
Você foi chegando e se apossando do meu coração
Entrou pelas veias e encharcou meu corpo de tantas maneiras
Que eu fiquei ilhada e molhada de amor pela noite inteira

Feito a enxurrada
Levando a folhagem que cai pela rua
Foi me arrastando até ter certeza que eu era sua

Quando amanheceu você era saudade
Não continuou naquela tempestade

I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Roberto Blanco,"Ich fuhr hin und her und kreuz und quer
Die sieben Meere lang
Schon manchesmal war ich sogar
Vor Einsamkeit so krank
Ab und zu gab's einen Hafen
Unser Schiff
Das drehte bei
Und wir legten an
So kam ich dann
So kam ich auch nach SAN BERNADINO.
Ich ging hin und her und kreuz und quer
Die Insel anzuseh'n.
Der Morgen war
Der Abend war
Noch nie so wunderschön.
Blaues Wasser
Gold'ne Sonne
Und der Palmen dunkles Grün
Ja
So lang ich kann
Denk' ich daran
Ich denke nur an SAN BERNADINO.
Oh
I love you so
SAN BERNADINO!
Oh
I love you so
SAN BERNADINO!
Und am zehnten Tag
Als ich da lag
Da kam der Kapitän
Ja
Es wäre heut' zum Aufbruch Zeit
Die Fahrt muß weitergeh'n.
Unser Schiff ist noch voll Whisky
Und viel tausend Tonnen Öl
Auf der Rückfahrt dann geht's schnell voran
Und keiner denkt an SAN BERNADINO.
Unser Käpt'n
Der mag was versteh'n von
Luv und Lee und Wind
Doch leider hat er nicht geseh'n
Mein schönes braunes Kind.
Aber ich traf sie I'm Mondschein
Auch die Sterne war'n dabei
Beim letzten Kuß sprach ich zu ihr:
Ich komm' zurück nach SAN BERNADINO!
Oh
I love you so ...

Thrown by three hopeful lovers
Which on will the fountain bless

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for its home
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome

Through the ripples how they shine
Just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Roberto Carlos,"Se você esta achando isso muito ruim, 
Sinto até que o nosso amor está chegando ao fim
Fica triste, de repente, faz pensar assim que você, 
Meu bem, já não gosta tanto de mim!

Alguém, quando gosta de alguém vê tudo bem, 
No bem do amor esquece que o mal existe, 
A tristeza é triste, não pensa na dor
Se você está achando isso muito ruim, sim, 
Porque você também precisa entender que a gente, 
Quando sente alguma coisa diz, 
É preciso ser assim, pra se sentir feliz",E Preciso Ser Assim

Roberto Carlos,"Essa é uma das muitas histórias
Que acontecem comigo
Primeiro foi Suzi, quando eu tinha lambreta
Depois comprei um carro, parei na contramão
Tudo isso sem contar o tremendo tapa que eu levei
Com a história do splish splash
Mas essa história também é interessante

Mandei meu Cadillac pro mecânico outro dia
Pois há muito tempo um conserto ela pedia
E como vou viver sem um carango pra correr
Meu Cadillac bip bip
Quero consertar meu Cadillac
Bip dubi indupi dubi

Com muita paciência o rapaz me ofereceu
Um carro todo velho que por lá apareceu
Enquanto o Cadillac consertava eu usava
O Calhambeque bip bip
Quero buzinar o Calhambeque
Bip dubi indupi dubi

Saí da oficina um pouquinho desolado
Confesso que estava até um pouco envergonhado
Olhando para o lado com a cara de malvado
O Calhambeque bip bip
Buzinei assim o Calhambeque
Bip dubi indupi dubi

E logo uma garota fez sinal para eu parar
E no meu Calhambeque fez questão de passear
Não sei o que pensei mas eu não acreditei
Que o Calhambeque bip bip,
O broto quis andar no Calhambeque
Bip dubi indupi dubi

E muitos outros brotos que encontrei pelo caminho
Falavam que estouro, que beleza de carrinho
E eu fui me acostumando e do carango fui gostando
O Calhambeque bip bip
Quero conservar o Calhambeque
Bip dubi indupi dubi

Mas o Cadillac finalmente ficou pronto
Lavado, consertado, bem pintado, um encanto
Mas o meu coração na hora exata de trocar
O Calhambeque bip bip
Meu coração ficou com o Calhambeque
Bip dubi indupi dubi

Bem, vocês me desculpem mas agora eu vou-me embora
Existem mil garotas querendo passear comigo
Mas é por causa desse Calhambeque, sabe?

Bye, bye, bye",O Calhambeque
Roberto Carlos,"Louco não estou mais
Malena eu esqueci
Susi aquela ingrata nunca mais eu vi
Vivo chorando e ninguém chora por mim
Meu beijo já não faz, não faz splish splash
Nunca mais chamei ninguém de baby meu bem
Vivo chorando
E ninguém chora por mim
Até Mr. Sandman me aconselhou
Roberto tome jeito, arranje um amor
Brotinho sem juízo deixe de ser
Senão em sua vida você vai sofrer
Linda foi namoro que pouco durou
Triste e abandonado atualmente eu estou
Vivo chorando
E ninguém chora por mim.

Puxa, mas como fala
A Candinha vive a falar de mim em tudo
Diz que eu sou louco, esquisito e cabeludo

Acho que a Candinha gosta mesmo de falar
Ela diz que eu sou maluco
E que o hospício é meu lugar
Mas a Candinha quer falar

A Candinha quer fazer da minha vida um inferno
Já está falando do modelo do meu terno
E que a minha calça é justa

E também a bota que ela acha extravagante
Ela diz que eu falo gíria
E que é preciso maneirar

A Candinha gosta de falar de toda gente
Mas as garotas gostam de me ver bem diferente
A Candinha fala mas no fundo me quer bem

Porém ela no fundo sabe que eu sou bom rapaz
E sabe bem que esta onda é uma coisa natural

Não é possivel que no fundo do seu peito
Seu coração não tenha lágrimas guardadas
Pra derramar sobre o vermelho derramado
No azul das águas que voce deixou manchadas

Seus netos vão te perguntar em poucos anos
Pelas baleias que cruzavam oceanos
Que eles viram em velhos livros
Ou nos filmes dos arquivos
Dos programas vespertinos de televisão

O gosto amargo do silêncio em sua boca
Vai te levar de volta ao mar e à fúria louca
De uma cauda exposta aos ventos
Em seus últimos momentos
Relembrada num troféu em forma de arpão

Como é possível que voce tenha coragem
De não deixar nascer a vida que se faz
Em outra vida que sem ter lugar seguro
Te pede a chance de existência no futuro

Vai te fazer um verdadeiro vencedor

Esperando un bebe

Tus deseos seran todos satisfechos
Importante es que tu sepas esperar
Tu voz ensalla la cancion que un dia
Muchas veces con ternura cantarás

Y tu vives pensando
Que nombre tendrá
El amor que detuvo
Tu amor para hacer
Y ese amor que en tus brazos tendrás

No se quien eres tú
Ni cual tu origen es
Tan sólo se que
Luces linda esperando un bebe
Esperando un bebe

Espero que haya
Sido con mucho amor
Quien sea que fue
El te vea tan bien que luces linda
Esperando un bebe

Voy a seguir, una luz en lo alto
Voy a oir,
una voz que me llama voy a subir
la montaña y estar aún mas cerca de Dios y rezar

Voy a gritar, y este mundo me oirá
y me seguirá
Todo este camino me ayudará,
a mostrar como es este grito de amor
y de fé

Voy a pedir, que las estrellas no paren de brillar
que los niños no dejen de sonreir
que los hombres jamás se olviden de agradecer

Por eso digo, Te agradezco Señor, un dia mas
Te agradezco Señor, que puedo ver
Que seria de mi sin la fé que yo tengo en tí

Por mas que sufra, Te agradezco Señor, también te lloro
Te agradezco Señor, por entender
que todo eso me enseñe el camino que lleva a tí

Una vez mas, Te agradezco Señor
por otro día
Te agradezco Señor que el sol nació
Te agradezco Señor, nuevamente agradezco Señor

Por eso digo, Te agradezco Señor por las estrellas
Te agradezco Señor, por la sonrisa
Te agradezco Señor, nuevamente agradezco Señor

Una vez mas, Te agradezco Señor,
por nuevo día
Te agradezco Señor, por la esperanza
Te agradezco Señor, nuevamente agradezco Señor

Por eso digo, Te agradezco Señor, por la sonrisa

Que yo era todo para usted

Surfa pelas ondas da canção

Folhas, flores, frutos se misturam
Nesse quadro amor e a perfeição
Quem é esse agricultor divino?
É o mesmo autor do quadro, então?

Como bom caminhoneiro
Peguei chuva e cerração
Quando chove o limpador desliza
Vai e vem no pára-brisa
Bate igual meu coração

Doido pelo doce do seu beijo
Olho cheio de desejo
O seu retrato no painel
É no acostamento dos seus braços
Que eu desligo meu cansaço
E me abasteço desse mel

E essas rugas marcadas pelo tempo

Siempre hay esperanza,
Si el amor te alcanza, deja penetrar su luz.

O ponteiro marca 120
O tempo diminui
As árvores passam como vultos
A vida passa, o tempo passa
Estou a 130
As imagens se confundem
Estou fugindo de mim mesmo
Fugindo do passado, do meu mundo assombrado
De tristeza, de incerteza
Estou a 140
Fugindo de você

Eu vou voando pela vida sem querer chegar
Nada vai mudar meu rumo nem me fazer voltar
Vivo, fugindo, sem destino algum
Sigo caminhos que me levam a lugar nenhum

O ponteiro marca 150
Tudo passa ainda mais depressa
O amor, a felicidade
O vento afasta uma lágrima
Que começa a rolar no meu rosto
Estou a 160
Vou acender os faróis, já é noite
Agora são as luzes que passam por mim
Sinto um vazio imenso
Estou só na escuridão
A 180
Estou fugindo de você

Eu vou, sem saber pra onde nem quando vou parar
Não, não deixo marcas no caminho pra não saber voltar
Às vezes sinto que o mundo se esqueceu de mim
Não, não sei por quanto tempo ainda eu vou viver assim

Por um momento tive a sensação
De ter você a meu lado
O banco está vazio
Estou só, a 200 por hora
Vou parar de pensar em você
Pra prestar atenção na estrada

Vou sem saber pra onde, nem quando vou parar

Roberto Carlos,"Quiero ser tu canción desde principio a fin
Quiero rozarme en tus labios y ser tu carmín
Ser el jabón que te suaviza, el baño que te baña
La toalla que deslizas por tu piel mojada

Yo quiero ser tu almohada, tu edredón de seda
Besarte mientras sueñas y verte dormir
Yo quiero ser el sol que entra y da sobre tu cama
Despertarte poco a poco, hacerte sonreír

Quiero estar en el más suave toque de tus dedos
Entrar en lo más íntimo de tus secretos
Quiero ser la cosa buena, liberada o prohibida
Ser todo en tu vida

Todo lo que me quieras dar quiero que me lo des
Yo te doy todo lo que un hombre entrega a una mujer
Ir más allá de ese cariño que siempre me das
Me imagino tantas cosas, quiero siempre más

Tú eres mi dulce desayuno, mi pastel perfecto
Mi bebida preferida el plato predilecto
Yo como y bebo de lo bueno y no tengo hora fija
De mañana, tarde o noche no hago dieta

Y este amor que alimenta a mi fantasía
Es mi sueño, es mi fiesta, es mi alegría
La comida más sabrosa, mi perfume, mi bebida
Es todo en mi vida

Todo hombre que sabe querer
Sabe dar y pedir a la mujer
Lo mejor y hacer de este amor
Lo que come, que bebe, que da, que recibe

El hombre que sabe querer
Y se apasiona por una mujer
Convierte su amor en su vida
Su comida y bebida, en la justa medida

Espantar la soledad

No vayas a decir mi nombre sin querer

Desesperada intentar llegar al fin 
Y hasta en ese momento tu iras a acordarte de mi

Hace tanto tiempo que en verdad lo merecía 
Y como necesito tanto el carro lo llevé a revisar bi, bi 
Quiero reparar mi cadilak, yu, bi, du, bi, du, bi, du, du, bi

Prestarme aquel cacharro que en el fondo apareció 
Y cuando el cadilak reparaban yo usaba aquel perol bi, bi

La rueda era ovalada y el arranque era de mano 
El freno frenaba un poco retrasado 
Temblaba como un loco atacado de sambito si señor bi,bi

Monté mi cacharrito y a una gran velocidad 
De diez millas por hora recorrí por la ciudad 
En cuanto yo paré una morena a mi lado se montó bi,bi 
La chica se prendió de mi perol

Y muchas otras chicas que encontré por el camino 
Estaban encantadas de montar en mi carrito 
Conforme pasa el tiempo yo me estoy encariñando más y más bi,bi 
Este cacharrito me gustó

Pero el cadilak ya está listo en el taller 
Lavado, preparado y pintado de verdad 
Pero mi corazón a la hora de cambiar me palpitó, bi, bi 
Mi corazón quedó en el perol

Existen mil muchachas que quieren salir conmigo
Pero todo es por causa de mi cacharro, saben
Voy, bye, tchau”",Mi Cacharrito [Road Hog]
Roberto Carlos,"Si, la vida entera has esperado un gran amor 
Y si es que has llorado sin esperanzas 
de encontrar alguien 
Debes saberlo mi amor que yo también anduve solo 
Y sin tener a quien pudiera yo entregarle mi cariño 
Y si en tu calle no crecen flores 
todo es tristeza al fin 
Y si cada día buscas amor y quieres ser feliz 
Debo decirte que mi corazón desea ser feliz 
Mi ojos rojos cansados de llorar quieren reir

Ah, por eso fue que decidí 
Que no estaré un minuto mas aqui, yo voy 
Voy a buscar mi amor, buscar mi amor

Yo nunca tuve amor, amor, amor, ahora tengo aqui 
Aquien mi corazón y nunca más voy a quedar tan solo 
Y nunca más voy a quedar tan solo amor 
Y nunca mas te dejaré tan solo amor",Nunca Mas Te Dejare Triste Amor [Eu Nao Vou Maix DeXar Voce Tao So]

Esta espera me canso 
Por eso llamo, reclamo
Sufrí así no tiene más sentido

Llorando, siempre por la vida llorando

Preciso oírla antes que yo siga amando

La busque y sin embargo
Tan solo aun estoy

Todo todo se olvida

El dia que me quieras
La rosa que engalana
Se vestira de fiesta
Con su mejor color

Y al viento las campanas
Diran que ya eres mia
Y locas las fontanas
Se juraran su amor

Bajo el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar

Y un rayo misterioso
Hara nido en tu pelo

Que vera

Durante muito, muito tempo em sua vida
Eu vou viver.
Detalhes tão pequenos de nós dois
São coisas muito grandes pra esquecer
E a toda hora vão estar presentes
Você vai ver

Se um outro cabeludo aparecer
Na sua rua
E isto lhe trouxer saudades minhas
A culpa é sua

O ronco barulhento do seu carro
A velha calça, desbotada ou coisa assim
Imediatamente você vai lembrar de mim

Eu sei que um outro deve estar falando
Ao seu ouvido
Palavras de amor como eu falei
Mas eu duvido

Duvido que ele tenha tanto amor
E até o erros do meu português ruim
E nessa hora você vai, lembrar de mim

E à noite, envolvida no silêncio do seu quarto
Antes de dormir você procura o meu retrato
Mas da moldura não sou eu quem lhe sorri
Mas você vê o meu sorriso mesmo assim
E tudo isto vai fazer você lembrar de mim

Se alguém tocar seu corpo como eu
Não diga nada
Não vá dizer seu nome, sem querer
À pessoa errada
Pensando ter amor nesse momento
Desesperada você tenta até o fim
E até nesse momento, você vai
Lembrar de mim

Eu sei que esses detalhes vão sumir
Na longa estrada
Do tempo que transforma todo amor
Em quase nada
Mas quase também é mais um detalhe
Um grande amor não vai morrer assim

Por isso é que de vez em quando você vai
Lembrar de mim",Detalhes

No need for greed or hunger

Nós nos amarmos
Nos entregarmos

Te dar meu corpo

E além de tudo
Depois de tudo
Te dar a minha paz

Você cansada
Te dar meu braço
No meu abraço
Fazer você dormir

Roberto Carlos,"Quando eu quero falar com Deus eu apenas falo
Quando eu quero falar com Deus às vezes me calo
E elevo o meu pensamento
Peço ajuda no meu sofrimento
Ele é Pai, Ele escuta o que pede o meu coração

Quantas vezes eu falando com Deus desabafo e choro
E alívio pro meu coração eu a Ele imploro
E então sinto a sua presença
Seu amor, sua luz tão intensa
Que ilumina o meu rosto e me alegra em minha oração

Quanta paz, quanta luz
Deus nos ouve, nos mostra o caminho que a Ele conduz
Deus é pai, Deus é luz
Deus nos fala que a ele se chega seguindo Jesus
É tão lindo falar com Deus em qualquer momento

Deus que vê uma folha que cai e é levada ao vento
Não existe onde ele não esteja
Ele pode escutar nossa voz
Deus no céu, Deus na Terra, aonde seja, está dentro de nós
Quanta paz, quanta luz
Deus nos ouve, nos mostra o caminho que a Ele conduz
Deus é pai, Deus é luz
Deus nos fala que a ele se chega seguindo Jesus",Quando Eu Quero Falar Com Deus

Da minha vida do meu destino
Do meu caminho
Cuida de mim
Sempre que o meu pranto rolar
Ponha sobre mim suas mãos
Aumenta minha fé e acalma o meu coração
Grande é a procissão a pedir
A misericórdia o perdão
A cura do corpo e pra alma a salvação

Tão necessitados de vós
Santa Mãe de Deus tem piedade de nós
De joelhos aos vossos pés
Estendei a nós vossas mãos
Rogai por todos nós vossos filhos meus irmãos
Nossa Senhora me de a mão
Cuida do meu coração
Da minha vida do Meu destino
Do meu caminho
Cuida de mim
Cubra-me com seu manto de amor
Guarda-me na paz desse olhar
Cura-me as feridas e a dor me faz suportar
Que as pedras do meu caminho
Meus pés suportem pisar
Mesmo ferido de espinhos me ajude a passar
Se ficaram mágoas em mim
Mãe tira do meu coração
E aqueles que eu fiz sofrer peço perdão
Se eu curvar meu corpo na dor
Me alivia o peso da cruz
Interceda por mim minha mãe junto a Jesus
Nossa Senhora me de a mão

Da minha vida do meu destino
Nossa Senhora me dê a mão

Eu posso lhe dizer
Entre no meu carro na estrada de Santos

Só ando sozinho e no meu caminho
O tempo é cada vez menor

Se acaso numa curva
Eu me lembro do meu mundo
Eu piso mais fundo, corrijo num segundo
Não posso parar

Eu prefiro as curvas da estrada de Santos
Onde eu tento esquecer
Um amor que eu tive e vi pelo espelho
Na distância se perder

Mas se o amor que eu perdi
Eu novamente encontrar, oh
As curvas se acabam e na estrada de Santos
Não vou mais passar
Não, não vou mais passar, oh

Roberto Carlos,"Além do horizonte deve ter
Algum lugar bonito pra viver em paz
Onde eu possa encontrar a natureza
Alegria e felicidade com certeza
Lá nesse lugar o amanhecer é lindo
Com flores festejando mais um dia que vem vindo
Onde a gente pode se deitar no campo
Se amar na relva escutando o canto dos pássaros

Aproveitar a tarde sem pensar na vida
Andar despreocupado sem saber a hora de voltar
Bronzear o corpo todo sem censura
Gozar a liberdade de uma vida sem frescura

Se você não vem comigo nada disso tem valor
De que vale o paraíso sem o amor
Se você não vem comigo tudo isso vai ficar
No horizonte esperando por nós dois

Além do horizonte existe um lugar
Bonito e tranqüilo
Pra gente se amar

Quero ao menos lhe falar
A distância não vai impedir
Meu amor de lhe encontrar

Cartas já não adiantam mais
Quero ouvir a sua voz
Vou telefonar dizendo
Que eu estou quase morrendo
De saudades de você

Eu te amo, eu te amo, eu te amo
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Eu não sei por quanto tempo eu
Tenho ainda que esperar
Quantas vezes eu até chorei
Pois não pude suportar

Para mim não adianta
Tanta coisa sem voce
E então me desespero
Por favor meu bem eu quero
Sem demora lhe falar

Eu quero contar
O quanto sofri por todo este tempo
Que eu quis lhe falar","Eu Te Amo, Te Amo, Te Amo"
Roberto Carlos,"Desde o começo do mundo
Que o homem sonha com a paz
Ela está dentro dele mesmo
Ele tem a paz e não sabe
É só fechar os olhos e olhar pra dentro de si mesmo

Que a verdade não mudou
Quando a paz foi ensinada
Pouca gente escutou
Meu Amigo volte logo
Venha ensinar meu povo
O amor é importante
Vem dizer tudo de novo

Outro dia, um cabeludo falou
""Não importam os motivos da guerra
A paz ainda é mais importante que eles""
Esta frase vive nos cabelos encaracolados
Das cucas maravilhosas
Mas se perdeu no labirinto
Dos pensamentos poluídos pela falta de amor
Muita gente não ouviu porque não quis ouvir
Eles estão surdos!

Tanta gente se esqueceu
Que o amor só traz o bem
Que a covardia é surda
E só ouve o que convém
Mas meu Amigo volte logo
Vem olhar pelo meu povo
O amor é importante
Vem dizer tudo de novo

Um dia o ar se encheu de amor
E em todo o seu esplendor as vozes cantaram
Seu canto ecoou pelos campos
Subiu as montanhas e chegou ao universo
E uma estrela brilhou mostrando o caminho
""Glória a Deus nas alturas
E paz na Terra aos homens de boa vontade""

Tanta gente se afastou
Do caminho que é de luz
Pouca gente se lembrou
Da mensagem que há na cruz
Meu Amigo volte logo
Venha ensinar meu povo
Que o amor é importante
Vem dizer tudo de novo",Todos Estão Surdos

Porquê me dou tanto assim
E porque não peço em troca

Por coisas que eu nunca fiz
Porque é que eu rolo na cama

E meio confusa desabotoava
Iam, pouco a pouco, me deixando ver

Travesseiros soltos, roupas pelo chão 
Braços que se abraçam 
Bocas que murmuram

Chovia lá fora e a capa pendurada 
Assistia a tudo e não dizia nada 
E aquela blusa que você usava
Num canto qualquer tranquila esperava",Os Seus Botões

Mas o meu silêncio foi maior
E na distância morro todo dia sem você saber

O que restou do nosso amor ficou
No tempo esquecido por você
Vivendo do que fomos ainda estou
Tanta coisa já mudou, só eu não te esqueci

Quantas vezes eu pensei voltar
E dizer que o meu amor nada mudou
Mas o meu silêncio foi maior

Tentei deixar de amar não consegui
Se alguma vez você pensar em mim

Entre el tuyo y mi pecho

Nuestras formas entallan

Es locura que trae
Éste sueño de paz
Bonito por demás
Y cuando nos besamos
Al amar olvidamos

Tiene forma ideal

pues tu belleza no ha cambiado

triste momentos yo pase
cuando a tu lado me acerqué
por que al estar acompañada
se cruzaron tres miradas
diciendo no puede ser
tú sonreiste yo tambien
trataba de disimular
por que senti que no eras mia
que otra vez te perderia
qu e te irias a marchar

Consertava eu usava
O Calhambeque, bi-bi
Quero buzinar o calhambeque
Bi bidhu! Bidhubidhu bidubi!

Saí da oficina
Um pouquinho desolado
Confesso que estava
Até um pouco envergonhado
Olhando para o lado
Com a cara de malvado
O Calhambeque, bi-bi
Buzinei assim o calhambeque
Bi bidhu! Bidhubidhu bidubi!

E logo uma garota
Fez sinal para eu parar
E no meu Calhambeque
Fez questão de passear
Não sei o que pensei
Mas eu não acreditei
Que o Calhambeque, bi-bi
O broto quis andar
No Calhambeque
Bi Bidhu! Bidhubidhu bidubi!

E muitos outros brotos
Que encontrei pelo caminho
Falavam ""que estouro
Que beleza de carrinho""
E fui me acostumando
E do carango fui gostando
E o Calhambeque, bi-bi
Quero conservar o calhambeque
Bi Bidhu! Bidhubidhu bidubi!

Mas o Cadillac
Finalmente ficou pronto
Lavado, consertado
Bem pintado, um encanto
Mas o meu coração
Na hora exata de trocar
Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
O calhambeque, bi-bi
Meu coração ficou com
O Calhambeque
Bi Bidhu! Bidhubidhu bidubi!

Bem, vocês me desculpem
Mas agora eu vou-me embora
Existem mil garotas
Querendo passear comigo
Mas é por causa
Desse calhambeque
Sabe!
Bye!
Bye!",O Calhambeque (Road Hog) [DVD]
Roberto Carlos,"Vou cavalgar por toda a noite
Por uma estrada colorida
Usar meus beijos como açoite
E a minha mão mais atrevida
Vou me agarrar aos seus cabelos
Pra não cair do seu galope
Vou atender aos meus apelos
Antes que o dia nos sufoque

Vou me perder de madrugada
Pra te encontrar no meu abraço
Depois de toda cavalgada
Vou me deitar no seu cansaço

Sem me importar se nesse instante
Sou dominado ou se domino
Vou me sentir como um gigante
Ou nada mais do que um menino

Estrelas mudam de lugar
Chegam mais perto só pra ver
E ainda brilham de manhã
Depois do nosso adormecer

E na grandeza desse instante
O amor cavalga sem saber
Que na beleza dessa hora
O sol espera pra nascer

Estrelas mudam de lugar
Chegam mais perto só pra ver
E ainda brilham na manhã
Depois do nosso adormecer",Cavalgada [DVD]
Roberto Carlos,"Tú eres mi hermano del alma realmente el amigo, 
Que en todo camino y jornada está siempre conmigo
Aunque eres un hombre aún tienes alma de niño,
Aquel que me da su amistad, su respeto y cariño
Recuerdo que juntos pasamos muyduros momentos, 
Y tú no cambiaste por fuertes que fueran los vientos
Es tu corazón una casa de puertas abiertas, 
Tú eres realmente el más cierto en horas inciertas

En ciertos momentos difíciles que hay en la vida, 
Buscamos a quién nos ayude a encontrar la salida
Y aquella palabra de fuerza y de fé que me has dado, 
Me da la certeza que siempre estuviste a mi lado
Tú eres mi amigo del alma en toda jornada, 
Sonrisa y abrazo festivo a cada llegada
Me dices verdades tan grandes con frases abiertas, 
Tú eres realmente el más cierto de horas inciertas

Pero es bueno así sentir que eres tú mi gran amigo

Adivinha onde ela anda?
Deve estar dentro do peito
Ou caminha pelo are

Pode estar aqui do lado
Bem mais perto que pensamos
A folha da juventude
É o nome certo desse amor

Já podaram seus momentos
Desviaram seu destino
Seu sorriso de menino
Quantas vezes se escondeu

Mas renova-se a esperança 
Nova aurora a cada dia
E há que se cuidar do broto
Pra que a vida nos dê flor e fruto

Coração de estudante
E há que se cuidar da vida
E há que se cuidar do mundo

Roberto Carlos,"Eu nunca sonhei com você 
Nunca fui ao cinema

Não vou a Ipanema 
Não gosto de chuva 
Nem gosto de sol 
E quando eu lhe telefonei 
Desliguei, foi engano 
O seu nome eu não sei 
Esqueci no piano
As bobagens de amor 
Que eu iria dizer 
Não, Ligia, Ligia 

Eu nunca quis tê-la ao meu lado 
Num fim de semana 
Um chope gelado 
Em Copacabana
Andar pela praia até o Leblon 
E quando eu me apaixonei 
Não passou de ilusão 
O seu nome rasguei 
Fiz um samba-canção
Das mentiras de amor 
Que aprendi com você

E quando você me envolver 
Nos seus braços serenos 
Eu vou me render 
Mas seus olhos morenos 
Me metem mais medo

Vou levar as minhas mágoas, pras águas fundas do mar
Hoje a noite namorar, sem ter medo da saudade
E sem vontade de casar

Calça nova de riscado, paletó de linho branco
Que ate o mês passado, lá no campo ainda era flor
Sob o meu chapéu quebrado, um sorriso ingênuo e franco
De um rapaz, novo e encantado, com vinte anos de amor

Aquela estrela é dela
Vida, vento, vela, leva-me daqui ...",Mucuripe

Talvez perdesse os sonhos
Dentro de mim
E vivesse na escuridão

Se eu não te amasse tanto assim
Talvez não visse flores
Por onde eu vim
Dentro do meu coração

E que tudo mais vá pro inferno

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Caem do meu queixo e secam sem tocar o chão

Roberto Goyeneche,"¡Decí, por Dios, que me has da'o
Que estoy tan cambiao!
¡No sé más quién soy!
El malevaje extrañao
Me mira sin comprender
Me ve perdiendo el cartel
De guapo que ayer
Brillaba en la acción
No ven que estoy embretao
Vencido y maniao
En tu corazón

Te vi pasar tangueando, altanera
Con un compás tan hondo y sensual
Que no fue más que verte y perder
La fe, el coraje, el ansia'e guapear
No me has dejado ni el pucho en la oreja
De aquel pasao malevo y feroz
Ya no me falta pa completar
Más que ir a misa e hincarme a rezar

Ayer, de miedo a matar
En vez de pelear
Me puse a correr
Me vi en la sombra o finao
Pensé en no verte y temblé
Si yo –que nunca aflojé
De noche angustiao
Me encierro a llorar
¡Decí por Dios que me has da'o
Que estoy tan cambiao
¡No sé más quien soy!",Malevaje
Roberto Goyeneche,"Era más blanda que el agua
que el agua blanda
Era más fresca que el río,
naranjo en flor
Y en esa calle de estío,
calle perdida,
dejó un pedazo de vida
y se marchó.

Primero hay que saber sufrir,
después amar, después partir
y al fin andar sin pensamiento.
Perfume de naranjo en flor,
promesas vanas de un amor
que se escaparon en el viento.

Después, qué importa del después
Toda mi vida es el ayer
que me detiene en el pasado
Eterna y vieja juventud
que me ha dejado acobardado
como un pájaro sin luz.

Que le habrán hecho mis manos?
Que le habrán hecho,
para dejarme en el pecho
tanto dolor?
Dolor de vieja arboleda,
canción de esquina,
con un pedazo de vida,
naranjo en flor.",Naranjo en Flor

de angelito con bluyín
vende rosas en las mesas
del boliche de Bachín

Si la luna brilla
sobre la parilla
come luna y pan de hollín

Cada día en su tristeza
que no quiere amanecer
lo madruga un seis de enero
con la estrella del revés
y tres reyes gatos
roban sus zapatos
uno izquierdo y el otro ¡también!

con un pan y un tallarín
se fabrica un barrilete

Roberto Goyeneche,"Que el mundo fue y será una porquería
Ya lo sé, en el quinientos seis
Y en el dos mil también
Que siempre ha habido chorros
Maquiavelos y estafaos
Contentos y amargaos, varones y dublé

Pero que el siglo veinte
Es un despliegue de maldad insolente
Ya no hay quien lo niegue
Vivimos revolcaos en un merengue
Y en el mismo lodo
Todos manoseaos

Hoy resulta que es lo mismo
Ser derecho que traidor
Ignorante, sabio, chorro
Generoso o estafador

¡Todo es igual, nada es mejor!
¡Lo mismo un burro que un gran profesor!
No hay aplazaos ni escalafón
Los inmorales nos han igualao

Si uno vive en la impostura
Y otro roba en su ambición
Da lo mismo que sea cura
Colchonero, rey de bastos
Caradura o polizón

¡Qué falta de respeto qué atropello a la razón!
¡Cualquiera es un señor!
¡Cualquiera es un ladrón!
Mezclao con Stravinsky va Don Bosco
Y La Mignon, Don Chicho y Napoleón
Carnera y San Martín

Igual que en la vidriera irrespetuosa
De los cambalaches
Se ha mezclao la vida
Y herida por un sable sin remache
Ves llorarla Biblia contra un calefón

¡Siglo veinte cambalache!
¡Problemático y febril!
El que no llora no mama
Y el que no afana es un gil

¡Dale nomás, dale que va!
¡Que allá en el horno¡
!Nos vamos a encontrar!
No pienses más, sentate a un lao
Que a nadie importa si naciste honrao
Es lo mismo el que labura
Noche y día, como un buey
Que el que vive de los otros
Que el que mata, que el que cura
O está fuera de la ley",Cambalache [Tango]
Roberto Goyeneche,"Tantas veces me mataron, tantas veces me morí
Sin embargo estoy aquí resucitando
Gracias doy a la desgracia y a la mano con puñal
Porque me mató tan mal y seguí cantando
Cantando al sol como la cigarra
Después de un año bajo la tierra

Igual que sobreviviente
Que vuelve de la guerra
Tantas veces me borraron, tantas desaparecí
A mi propio entierro fui solo y llorando
Hice un nudo en el pañuelo pero me olvidé después
Que no era la única vez y seguí cantando

Cantando al sol
Tantas veces te mataron, tantas resucitarás
Cuántas noches pasarás desesperando
Y a la hora del naufragio y la de la oscuridad
Alguien te rescatará para ir cantando
Cantando al sol",Como La Cigarra [Milonga]
Roberto Goyeneche,"Me torturé sin ti y entonces te busqué
Por los caminos del recuerdo
Y en el pasado más lejano
Te agitabas por volver
Y por librarte de ese infierno

Y se arrastró hasta mi
Tu vida sin amor
Con su dolor y su silencio
Y disfrazamos un pasado
Que luchaba por querer volver

Y fuiste tu
La que alegró mi soledad
Quien transformó en locura
Mi pasión y mi ternura
Y en horror mis horas mansas

Tu, mi tango triste, fuiste tu
Y nadie existe más que tu en mi destino
Y hoy te haz hecho a un lado en mi camino
Y es muy tarde ya, para volver
Llorando atrás y contener la angustia
Que por mustia duele mucho más

Se desgarró la luz
Y enmudeció mi voz
Aquella noche sin palabras
Al ver que tu alma estaba ausente
Y a tu lado siempre yo
Como una cosa abandonada

Y se arrastró hasta ti
La sombra de otro amor
Y otra voz que te llamaba
Y me sumiste en un pasado
Que luchaba por querer volver",Mi Tango Triste
Roberto Goyeneche,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo

La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón

Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Roberto Inglez,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say

Roberto Ottaviano,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms

Roberto Perera,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco

Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

¿Qué te ganas con verme llorando?
Me arrancaste el alma en pedazos
Y ahora en sollozos me dejas morir

Sabes bien que mi vida es tu vida
Que la tienes prendida en tus brazos
Si me niegas tus besos mi cielo
Quítame la vida, no me hagas sufrir

No te vayas mi amor te lo ruego
Que te quiero bien lo sabe Dios
Si tus besos es que son ajenos
Que venga la muerte y nos lleve a los dos

Preferible estar seis pies abajo
Que saber que me estás engañando
Porque dentro del pecho yo siento
Que me estoy muriendo de tanto dolor

Es que nunca en la vida has sentido
Una flecha en el pecho clavada
Que las sientas que te esté matando
Poquito a poquito sin verla sangrar

No te vayas mi amor te lo ruego
Que te quiero bien lo sabe Dios
Si tus besos es que son ajenos
Que llegue la muerte y nos lleve a los dos

Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you

On the straight and narrow highway

Let it rain, rain, rain.

Her life was like a desert flower burning in the sun.
Until I found the way to love, it's harder said than done.

La playa de mi cariño la arrazó
En mi fué tan dolorosa que es mi vida
Llorar por aquella triste despedida

Marejada feliz, vuelve y pasa por mi
Aun yo digo que si, que todavía pienso en ti

El vertigo que mi alma provocó
Lo intimo sacudió en mi corazón

Quisiera la marejada la playa de mi cariño
Sin ella no estoy en nada sollozando como un niño

Sin ella no estoy en nada
Soy como un árbol que espera
Que una lluvia pasajera
Le devuelva su belleza

Su pelo color del sol
Y sus ojos azul del mar
Son dos cosas que en la vida
Yo nunca podré olvidar

Ahora mi vida es el mar
Vivo contando las olas
Y así me pasan las horas
Y vuelve a llegar la aurora

Todas las noches me voy

That when your love wears golden earrings,

I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all

Roberto Vecchioni,"E ti diranno parole rosse come il sangue
Nere come la notte 
Ma non è vero, ragazzo
Che la ragione sta sempre col più forte 
Io conosco poeti 
Che spostano i fiumi con il pensiero 
E naviganti infiniti 
Che sanno parlare con il cielo
Chiudi gli occhi, ragazzo
E credi solo a quel che vedi dentro 
Stringi i pugni, ragazzo
Non lasciargliela vinta neanche un momento 
Copri l'amore, ragazzo
Ma non nasconderlo sotto il mantello 
A volte passa qualcuno 
A volte c'è qualcuno che deve vederlo 

Sogna, ragazzo sogna 
Quando sale il vento 
Nelle vie del cuore 
Quando un uomo vive 
Per le sue parole 
O non vive più

Sogna, ragazzo sogna
Non lasciarlo solo contro questo mondo 
Non lasciarlo andare sogna fino in fondo 
Fallo pure tu

Sogna, ragazzo sogna 
Quando cade il vento ma non è finita 
Quando muore un uomo per la stessa vita 
Che sognavi tu 

Sogna, ragazzo sogna 
Non cambiare un verso della tua canzone 
Non lasciare un treno fermo alla stazione 
Non fermarti tu

Lasciali dire che al mondo 
Quelli come te perderanno sempre 
Perchè hai già vinto, lo giuro
E non ti possono fare più niente 
Passa ogni tanto la mano 
Su un viso di donna, passaci le dita 
Nessun regno è più grande 
Di questa piccola cosa che è la vita 

E la vita è così forte 
Che attraversa i muri per farsi vedere 
La vita è così vera 
Che sembra impossibile doverla lasciare 
La vita è così grande 
Che quando sarai sul punto di morire 
Pianterai un ulivo
Convinto ancora di vederlo fiorire 

Sogna, ragazzo sogna
Quando lei si volta
Quando lei non torna
Quando il solo passo 
Che fermava il cuore 
Non lo senti più 

Sogna, ragazzo, sogna 
Passeranno i giorni 
Passerrà l'amore
Passeran le notti 
Finirà il dolore
Sarai sempre tu

Sogna, ragazzo sogna 
Piccolo ragazzo 
Nella mia memoria
Tante volte tanti 
Dentro questa storia
Non vi conto più

Sulla scrivania
Manca solo un verso 
A quella poesia
Puoi finirla tu",Sogna Ragazzo Sogna

Vide che cercava lui e si spaventò

Bianche le torri che infine toccò, 
Ma c'era su la porta quella nera signora 
Stanco di fuggire la sua testa chinò: 
Eri fra la gente nella capitale, 
So che mi guardavi con malignità, 
Son scappato in mezzo ai grillie alle cicale, 
Son scappato via ma ti ritrovo qua! 

Sbagli, t'inganni, ti sbagli soldato 
Io non ti guardavo con malignità, 
Era solamente uno sguardo stupito, 
Cosa ci facevi l'altro ieri là? 
T'aspettavo qui per oggi a Samarcanda 
Eri lontanissimo due giorni fa, 
Ho temuto che per ascoltar la banda 
Non facessi in tempo ad arrivare qua 

Non è poi così lontana Samarcanda,

Ho cantato insieme a te tutta la notte 
Corri come il vento che ci arriverà

Roberto Vecchioni,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Robi Rosa,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

And got so far

Refugiarse desnudo en el discreto
Calor de Dios, y en su cerrado
Puño, crecer igual que un feto

Morir es encenderse bocabajo
Hacia el humo y el hueso y la caliza

Quiero vivir y volver a empezar
Morir y no olvidar
Morir y volver a epezar

To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger. ",Don't Let Me Come Home a Stranger

Can make, you feel bitter,

But summer's gone, baby, and the walking's done.
So, tell me gently, who'll be your lover?
Who'll be your lover after I am gone?
Will it be the moon that hears your sighing?
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome sigh?
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom?
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair?
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning?
Will the rose be in your arms when I find you waiting there?

Heading east before a sinking sun
The snow was melting though just barely
On the wind-blown and rain-soaked prairie
I wondered, would the journey once begun
Lead me back or to somewhere far away?

CHORUS:
I spoke to you in my mind
I tried the right words to find
Though the words were not for you to hear
They were meant but for my ear
They were thoughts that came to me out on the road
To put down in the letter that I wrote

I loved you as I've told you
When no one else had kindness to share
I gave you all I had to give
You were the reason I had to live
Still I wonder as I leave in deep despair
Were you someone that I never knew

CHORUS:

When at last I stopped to take my rest
I took pen and paper in my hand
I began to tell you every heartache
Every way I suffered for you sake
But the weariness I could not stand
I fell sleeping as the sun sank in the west

And I dreamed we were pebbles by the sea
On a blue world spinning through space

Where solitude is the curse
And sorrow speaks from every face
And the tides wash us to our destiny",Letter That I Wrote

His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal

Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito he was king of the street
She was his possession like a jewel in his crown
Johnny better run better run

Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Better say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire

He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start

Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun

Better hide your heart 'cause you're playing with fire

As time stood still
They couldn't hear him coming till he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill

A shot rang out like thunder
And the blood was on her hands
With nothing won when someone lies there dying

So many days I would hope and pray
she was mine, mine

In the face of incredible odds.

It's as easy as talking to you. 
All my life, having you there.

Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones.

Or have they given up and all gone home to bed,
Thinking those who once existed must be dead.

And now I toss and turn at night, afraid I'll never find

Même si des fois c'est vrai dans le café je l'aime

J'ai besoin de ma dose de moral, j'ai besoin de ma dose, c'est normal

Je voulais que tu viennes pour que l'on puisse enfin
Régler tous ces problèmes en te frottant les seins

Même si des fois c’est faux

Y’a pas grand-chose à faire 
Non pas grand-chose à faire

À tout ce qu’on s’était dit

au fond comme une terre sans eau

comme dans ces p’tites rues d'Amsterdam
Qui s'ennuient à trop faire la fête 
et s'endorment à sortir les rames

Mais le vent crie pas d'inquiétude

Si tu viens dans mon pays on pourra
Aller au sommet de la tour Magdala
Prendre ces routes qui n'en finissent jamais
Ranger nos doutes dans ces petits coins de forêt

Il serait temps de s'allonger sous les branches
Au milieu des pâtures, près d'un figuier qui s'épanche

Même si tu partais loin trop vite, à chaque fois

Tu m'attendais souvent
Même si je prenais mon temps

On se perdait sur le chemin de cette histoire trop forte
C’était la noyade assurée qui parfois réconforte
Mais ne fais rien ca n'sert à rien si je m'emporte
Tu sais l'amour parfois s'assèche comme la mer morte

Tu m'attendais souvent
Même si je prenais mon temps

J'me suis dit merde je ne sais pas si je suis aussi sûr
De vouloir partager pour toi, ces quatre murs
Mais ne dit rien ca n'sert rien d'être aussi dure

I don't know my elbow from my ear

And let your light shine in the darkness
And let your rain fall in the desert.

So you love this city and you love these streets.

Every baby laying on the bedroom floor.

Every dreamer dreaming in her dead-end job
Every driver driving through the rush hour mob
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones
You're going to send revival, bring them all back home

I can hear that thunder in the distance
Like a train on the edge of town
I can feel the brooding of Your Spirit
""Lay your burdens down, Lay your burdens down"".

From the Preacher preaching when the well is dry
To the lost soul reaching for a higher high
From the young man working through his hopes and fears
To the widow walking through the veil of tears

Every man and woman, every old and young
Every fathers daughter, every mothers son.
I feel it in my spirit, feel it in my bones

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
And each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
And in the winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, and a World that doesn't care

I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so special about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

Possibly
And I hope that you are
Having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy

My heroes had the heart
To live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little
