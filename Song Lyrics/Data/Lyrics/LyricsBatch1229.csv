The Low Anthem,"See me laying in the grass
Where my true love's bound to pass
And I don't have to try
It's a matter of time
A matter of time
A matter of time

We will roll beneath the sky
In the clover and dandelion
And I don't have to try
I know she'll be by
I know she'll be by
It's a matter of time

See me decorate my nest
See me puffing out my chest
I hate to be so vain
It's just part of the game
Just part of the game
A matter of time

Hear me howling at the moon
In her wake of sweet perfume
I don't have to fear
She'll pull me through the mirror
Pull me through the mirror
In a matter of time

In the grass I lay alone
See the sunset down below
I don't make a sound
It's always circling round
Always circling round
It's a matter of time",Matter of Time
The Low Anthem,"See the high wire man, there before the sun
He goes home at night, where he beats his son
The playwright in the attic, in his skylight of sun
As the cigarette on his lips

And his son beats down, on the smart smart flesh
It comes down from high, in its heavenly stand
Suggesting redemption, will be easily possessed
For less then any pound of flesh

It's terribly important, to every man of his state
To settle the score, write the record straight
So he may free his slaves, where on the death bed he lays
Such sweet and knowing flesh

Knowing in the end, you'll be alone
For lonely death does creep
So hire yourself, a chimney maid
And smoke yourself to sleep

Among the mannequin man, all dresses up and in dart
My manic depressive true love, she leaves me forlorn
The rooster crawls, and daybreak is upon
As the cigarette on his lips

Saying pretty girls, go and take your time
For God only knows how you have taken mine
And seize them clear, to the ends of time
To hold the smart smart flesh

Knowing in the end, you'll be alone
For lonely death does creep
So hire yourself, a chimney maid
And smoke yourself to sleep

Now the hateful playwright, it's time that he dies
Must visit the judge in a new disguise
Saying judge in your robes, oh judge so wise
There's something on your lip

In a man of his state, right before he dies
Must clear the black pages to tarnish the mind
In a bible in a bath, for mind to hide
He soak the smart smart flesh

Saying in the end, you'll be alone
For lonely death does creep
So hire yourself, a chimney maid
And smoke yourself to sleep

The unknowing tumor, is fixing his home
In a damp bed of the catacomb
As a raging war, on the high wire unfolds
She buries her teeth in the flesh

Now the world's a machine, do you know that it's true?
For the sole lover's eye laid just outside the room
He loves itself widely but what can it do
The cigarette on his lip",Smart Flesh
The LOX,"What's the deally yo? 
I gotta squeeze the juice outta the headphones 

Yeah (I like that) 
Squeeze the juice outta the headphones 
Yo, yo yo 

When you think of me you think of a problem 
Who? What? When? and how you gonna solve em 
Automatic or revolving 
The K I double S and, Here's the lesson 
Most beams is infrared, but mine's is fluorescent 
No matter where you go, I'ma spot you 
No matter how many people you put me in front of, I'ma rock you 
And if you try to be the hard top, I'ma drop you 
I got to, treat you like the clutch, and pop you 
Creep threw, in the 4-20 with your honey 
'Cause you ain't nothin' but a playboy that turned bunny 
And the only the thing left to discuss is more money 
In these ? games these chickens, try to run me 
y'all know y'all can't touch us, I flow lushes 
It's so real I make her hop out, and get the dutches 
I'm sittin on a thousand birds, and I hide from the cameras (why?) 
'Cause a picture's, worth a thousand words 
Ain't y'all heard? y'all get what y'all deserved 
y'all do the catering, while we just get served 
And you got some nerve, for P-Hing 
Jason, do you have any idea who you facing? 
Just something about my shit, you'll never figure out 
It's hot it's burning my mouth, that's why I spit it out 
It must be, real hard for y'all to listen 
And it's sad, niggas is to broke to pay attention 

[Chorus: x2] 
Chilling, sittin' on about half a million 
And all my niggas, all my guns, all my women 
Next two years I should see about a billion 
All for the love of drug dealing 

Hey yo, niggas know the line of work, Bullet proof designer shirt 
Rolling with a China Doll, She'll be reminding y'all 
Don of the underworld, every block minded it of course 
Jadakiss and L-O-X boss 
A pro cause I grow off the shit that I absorb 
You just another so and so, trying to flow, going broke 
You trying to buy property, set it up for growing coke 
Niggas making a movie, so I came to edit 
Wiping everybody out, right before the credits 
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with 
When shit be going right, I flip into the wrong shit 
The prime artist, expect me to rhyme hardest 
Slash con artist, gonna get mine regardless 
I ain't even big and I size niggas up 
'Cause they eyes give em up, look at em and see they butt 
I'm 22 with 10 ends so there that go 
You hear that flow, and drove the underground wacko 
Every since 12 I've been spitting like tobacco 
Relax though, Pop the tape CD and the wax though 
They wonder how, but the thing about ours 
We open up 24 hours 
Niggas don't sleep with eat so when they speak it mean power 
So you should keep quiet, you a coward 
About to be laid out flat, and pushing up flowers 

[Chorus]",All for the Love
The LOX,"[Jadakiss]
Hey yo, I woke up in a daze wit' the slight headache.
You know the usual, the studio gettin' red late.
Serious jet lag when I get to bed late.
That why I fuck, 'cause I be weak when I get head late.
Today I got a session wit' Ronnie, I mean Veronica. 
Met her last year, about a week before Hanukkah.
Sounds foolish, I mean, honey wasn't Jewish,
But she had a lot of dough and she was nice on computers.
She told me she was born and raised in Bermuda,
And came here to get a job as a tutor.
I pursued, make a long story short, screwed her.
She moved, and she came back, still on the same track.
Same wit' same chips, ass, it was still fat. 
I ain't really think she was a freak, 
But she did ask a lot of questions 'bout Stylez and Sheik.
She called me and said she was in town fo' a week,
The Westside, Manhattan, the Suite and the Marquise.
How I felt about gettin' up fo' old times sake.
I'm a bring Stylez and Sheik wit' me, datta be great. 
Jus' have two friends, we gon' bring the truck and the new Benz. 
Desert in the, stashin' the Sony cam, zoom lens.
All have ourselves one big hell of a weekend.
Eat at Puff's joint, an' catch a show at the beacon.
Twist a dutch blaze from Y-O to the Hudson.
Pass the tall one, two-five, we still puffin.
We got the heat on a cold night 'n the winter. 
Stylez you remember, Sheik you remember.

[Sheek]
Oh yeah, I remember them hos that night.
We was at the beacon, right?
Chris Tucker performing.
All of us was in der, outside it was stormin',
Cats and Dogs. 
hey yo, dese hos wuz tough.
Besides the air condition on high, we wuz icy enough.
From my neck to the belt buckle, to our shoes, shall I go on? 
Wit' five of us up front, he needed shades to perform.
Mose from the flow, up we inside, toe up.
I drink, they smoke, no coke.
Besides the shit he said on stage, the cash we had on us wuz no joke.
I slid fo' seats down, she sittin' there, smilin'. 
Lookin' like she from an island, not them chicks that be out wilin'. 
Told me that her name wuz Cindy,
Favorite show Mork and Mindy,
Favorite color, green, no kids, but plan to have plenty. 
We chit den chat, 'bout dis 'n dat.
From what kind of whip she push,
To what bar she be at,
She played hard to get,
But we made it from the movie to the jacuzzi, 
From the jacuzzi to the bed,
We fucked until we both got woozy.
Woke up, breath stinkin', 
Yawnin' and shit.
I smelt breakfast in the kitchen, but where was the bitch?
I walked in there, it was cheese, eggs, and grits on the table,
Wit' beef sausages and orange juice, next to the cable.
Wit' a note saying sorry, I had to rob you, baby, but 
I need cash like you, I ain't your ordinary slut,
Or dick teaser, please, I need food in my freezer.
And by the time you read dis note, I done been spent yo' Visa.

[Stylez]
I remember Beatrice, but niggas like me call her B,	 
'Cause she like to fuck doggy style, plus hold the D. 
But now I got to handle dis 'cause they skandalous. 
Cindy robbed Shiek and moved to Los Angeles,
Like I won't kill a friends. 
Went to bounce, stole a Benz.
Note in the garage:
Tu y'all entourage.
Y'all three rugged niggas, but y'all gotta get robbed.
Don't take it personal, we didn't finish the job. 
MÃ©nage Ã  trois.
We kill niggas wit' they dick hard.
They got me lookin' at the letta stuff. 
Why the fuck they left the truck? 
Three bitches in my house,
Probably try to wet me up.
Crept to the kitchen,
Seen Ronnie by the cabinet.
Tried the gun holster with the forty fo' Magnum,
Shot her in the heart.
Den caught the earchess fabanet.
Den I seen Cindy,
The bitch tried to end me,
Running out the living room,
Bustin' off Kissimee.
The bitch couldn't aim,
So I blew her out the frame.
Turned around to Beatrice,
Why you look speachless?
We could have lived it up and jus' fucked on the beaches, 
And now you gotta die,
And the stupid bitch is reaching.
Be'fo I cocked it back
I heard tires screeching,
Saw Shiek and James,
Started motherfucking squeezin.",Bitches from Eastwick

[Stlyes]
Can't stop, won't stop
Everything drop like panties, hot like Miami
Move like little black kid stealing candy
Barely seen, honnies call me barely cream
Real generals never fail eighteen
Would you believe, I know what's up your sleeve
If you said in your last time, ?
And thought he saw the devil, Jay kissed his feet
You think not, as if
Sheek won't bring it to you, give you asthma's
Is he rocking cashmere? Y'all
know we don't pass there
Matter fact, I scoped out there last year
Hit him on the head said there ain't no cash there
Stay home, Styles about to hit Tony Rhomes
Puff out his own with this chick from Rome
? funny how I'm greedy, used to be needy
But now the Sean-Don keep the ?

[Chorus: x2 Puff Daddy]
Too many people worried about what we got
Everything we drop will be hot
Puff Daddy and the Goodfellas don't stop
Can't stop, won't stop

[Sheek]
Hey, yo it's crazy we here now
every chick want my baby
My career clear while your shit look hazy
Bang with us? I don't think so, we platinum plus
With no airplay so ain't shit for us to discuss
But when we hit, you can't understand how we did it
At home practicing trying to learn how we spit it
Fourty-eight hours of old tea like Nick Nolte
Young but O-G's at this rap shit nigga please
One hit for all of us to start eating
And wild stack on three weeks
on bowell leather beats
Our parents are sharp like cactus's
And you can tell by chips, we sleep on mattresses
Dimes flooded out in the hideous
Shit you see in magazines, cut
out we freak them hoes
Drop them clothes, double expose you in the lens
Now relax as we videotape you in the bed

[Chorus: x2]

[Jay]
If we talk about dollars, only thing
I turn down is my collar
Pull out turn them around, if he
reach make him holler
Who running the town? The Goodfellas
Puff is the godfather, dog, so why bother?
With the third-person, you might catch me surfing
Money I be jerkin, my newborn be burping
Can't stop, won't stop, I want respect
And I only bum heads with checks
In the suite with this honey from Bangladesh
Pop a snapple, I ? lay on my chest
All I had to do was get it there, she doing the rest
Take a L to the head, then we listen to flex
Yes, the black hood, and I mack good
With hydro and chocolate mixed in backwood
Ask yourself, do you rap good or act good?
Baby we ain't gon' stop, but you should

[Chorus]","Can't Stop, Won't Stop"
The LOX,"[Sheek]
Uh, yo, yo
Hey Yo it's fucked up, in the right hand
Flash his badge with his left hand
On some Donnie Brascoe shit, forget about it
Made men, should hang with made men
Not the wife and children, that's when rats come in
It be your girl in the palor, talking like shit rich
And next to her, getting her nails done is your enemy's bitch
Now you stuck, 'cause she in there, leeking, speaking
Not knowing, she being, followed, on the decan
Niggas talk to feds like, it's a sport
Lord forbid the head nigga get caught
And watch the whole family tree break down, faster than you thought
I watch the nigga with my own eyes get knocked, no doubt
Next week he outside front, how he get out?
Now that's guapo nigga? his family talk?
Mexico for safety you get twist for that sammy shit
Thinking you threw with the feds and all that
That's when they got you, just like that kid from Strapped
I stay, clear to mubblers who mubble to the cops
Brick fumblers who just want a nigga popped
But the only thing I pop is my burners in the dark

[Chorus: x2]
Yo it's like that y'all (that y'all) Time to stack ya'll (stack ya'll)
Nowadays everybody want to rat y'all (wanna rat y'all)
And it don't even matter where you at y'all (where you at y'all)
When the feds come and get you that's that y'all (that's that y'all)

[Styles]
Fake lieuteno, on a sing, make a demo
Switch up ya ammo, fill out the memo
Now you got the dogs locked up in the kennel
Rat, talking to the cops like that
On a 3-4 P you can't cop like that
You ain't have a chance, fly from Japan
Talk to the judge, get you out the can
My man had the same case (that's my word)
Spent three years in the same place, He still there
Came down for a pill, it was still real there
Money came between us, know you seen us
Move like the teamsters in the beamers
Get blacked down and hit the cleaners
The feds know everything, who bled and everything
Before we got red, honeys giving us head
Herion and guns is on the files of Styles
But they came in the crib, lifting the towel
Heard the sergent scream out ""start stripping the child""
And they blew down the door ? snitching involved
Wonder who? A boss, or a nigga under you
Probably figure it out, when you sit for one or two
Six months in bail, is how you catch a snail
Moving real slow, trying to steal dough

[Chorus: x2]

[Jadakiss]
Lies to the story, mines yours and the truth
What you talk for? They ain't even had no proof
But you play this street business, all in the street
To visit him now, you gotta drive for a week
What you expect? Messing with the guard so tough
Fuck calling his bluff, they made him put his cards up
Your hands, wrists, and neck was rocked up
Now 23 hours a day you locked up
Your girl, she out in the world, knocked up
By some cat you supposed that shot up
Man enough to eat steak wit em, get cake em
But you scared to go upstate wit em
Where you going, you won't get good sleep no more
See the street no more, or skeet no more
Ride around in the P, with the heat no more
From top to not even on your feet no more
'Fore they gave ya any time, you spoke your mind
Since they giving out jerseys, get on line
For your football numbers, want to take us all under
What happened to shorty? They gave him tall numbers
I don't think so, I don't think so either
But he told em every thing he knew and made em hit the ?

[Chorus]",Everybody Wanna Rat
The LOX,"Why they always talking about money?
Cause we like money bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah
L-O-X and we won't stop
Bad Boy, I'm a show you how we get this money

You can't take this
Players hate this
Rainbow glow
European bracelet
Made his mouth drop, now he need a face lift
Mommies run up on me and ask me to taste it
Hand on my crotch
Got to be the sales or the band on my watch
Damn I'm so hot!
They call me arrogent
While you slide with seven mommies in a Caravan
You start traveling
I'll make you a believer
Hotter in the club getting brain from a diva
Leave with a beezer
Black Cadillac riding with an old geezer
With ten different hustles so every foe sees us
No reason
We just peas in a pod
trying to get the paper
We the g's in the lot
Long as the water boil we bound to keep it hot
It's gon' be turmoil if you thinking that it's not

I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)

Three fly cats that get money with go gimmicks
Y'all just so timid
My soldiers be no limit
What you know about renting a yacht with twenty jet-skis
And riding out till the Coast Guard come and get me
Beat that!
Me, Stylez, and Sheek be like 4, 5, 6 so no matter what you roll you
can't beat that
Who you know could take an old record and flip like Puff?
From small clubs to arenas
Who flip like us?
Everytime they pull up
Whips be plush
Chicks be tough
Bad Boy, Hits R Us
Back it's me, West Indies
Slimmy
Me and Kimmy
And I taught her how to say, ""May I have a steady gimme""
I ain't bustin cause we picked up them joints you tossed
Y'all was hot until The Lox came and cooled y'all off
It's the Kiss
Are you hearing me?
I think I'm blessed lyrically
Mad rappers with three LP's sill fearing me

I'm a show you how you get this money (Make it hot)
I'm a show you how you get this money (Don't stop)
I'm a show you how you get this money (I fucks wit you)

I'm a show you how you get this money (Get money)

You see, we bounce on tracks like bas-ketball
And bust down songs till our throat need Halls
L-O-X-pedition
I spend all day fishing
And won't catch one
Just me and mommy out in the sun
Just sailing, chain so icy if I threw it up
You think it was hailing
Don't even ask me what the price be
To go to a show, no clubs just arenas
Headliner Stevie Wonder, no small cat between us
After parties be goin like Venus
My chick gots be the meanest
Before I come
That night
If she ain't she ain't partying right
That's how we like to play in Bad Boys with all the fly shit
And that's how we do the chips kid
Multiplying
Beef, don't apply it
Please don't try it cause we ain't with that
But if so you gon' need a plastic bag where your shit at
Lox and we got that cash you want to get at

The LOX,"I think it's time I start feeling bitchy
I've been too nice, too motherfucking long
Yeah, it's definitely time I get nasty
(Goin' be some shit)

[Sheek]
Yeah, yo, well if I can't talk less squall finish streets like the westerns
Ten paces, turn around and squeeze at unfamiliar faces
First y'all industry niggas shut the fuck up
Swear you know a nigga's shit by readin the Vibe
Well some faggit-ass reporter don, wrote in your life
I stop the presses, don't let this be your last interview you do
I say it straight, print it straight to avoid this bullet wound boo
And y'all niggas kill me with that Windy Williams shit
Well see a player ?, swear a nigga Puff jerkin niggas money
Something ain't right, them niggas ain't got no whips
Where they rolley's at, but fuck y'all we got more chips
Shit y'all doing nothing, I can buy a ? for a bitch
Now let me see what else, oh yeah these hoes act like we married
We ain't engaged, don't be mad if I don't take you backstage
Yo, if I hit that I hit that, why don't you leave it at that
Instead you try to star sixty-nine my bitches on jacks
That's why you get smacked, cause y'all hoes ain't never gon' learn
That's why many of these younger brothers don't go on that turn
As for y'all MC's, whoever write your rhymes
Might as well hold your microphone, that's how I feel if it ain't your own
But we spit as individually writ, why you paid sixteen stars to write your
Sixteen balls
Bought like sixteen cars and ain't like none of them yours
y'all niggas lucked up and made it through these doors, shut the fuck up

[Chorus:]
Shut the fuck up
(Hot damn)
(Going be some shit)

[Sheek]
Yo, yo, yo, hey yo I pump up, get big walk through the party jig
Hat back, tattoos that's straight to the bar, kid
No weed, healthy as an ox the big man from Lox
You see solo in some spots, no crew just blocks
The freaky one, mom said I was soon to be done
Because I sexed more, and my career's yet to begun
But I can't help that, you bless me with they looks and pops with the yanks
So now the dimes gimme brain, and spot me faster in his hand
Sheek baby, my style been rough until Puff showed me the better things in life
And how to live phat like Biggie, so I present my shit like that
Half rough half jiggy, this part time college nigga, part time job
Had to taste the cake one time and decided to rob, and buy drugs
Caught slipping almost got Sheek plugged, Jack Daniel, dog
Shorty rushed the building with the pump out, he spit around I'm like, whoa!
I guess it was God that pushed my head down, cause I ain't know, word yo
And since then neither religious or christian, but I keep the faith in Him
Plus the desert eagle clan, so if niggas click they know by now they better
? wha

[Chrous]

[Sheek]
Yo, hey yo, my whole click been ConAir, every time we fly but we don't jack shit
We play it cool when in doubt no cash, plastic, gats plastic
Now that's sweet, undetected, so when I walk through the scanners it don't beep
I hear fuck Sheek, fuck the Lox, Styles, and Jay, so what they signed to Bad Boy
Puff jerkin them anyway, but the difference is if I'm gettin jerked I'm still
Seeing noise
Push the big boy toys that fly by like zooms
So I sit and ? like a bitch, Lox in Cancun
Up in daddios fucking wild hoes, the groupy chicas
So fuck y'all, we paid y'all ?, we train hard continuously, cause we
Smart
I rock you ran up them stairs, we run up charts and won't stop til one of us
Depart
With one through the heart, but even then that won't stop us
Cause or spirit gon' guide us, till we rich and old, hand worn down from
Arthritis
In the hall of fame, we killed this game in your website like spiders
Old and gray we're still the same Lox you can't divide us, wha

[Chorus]",Goin' Be Some Shit
The LOX,"[Styles]
Catch me in the dirt ?
In the ? porche burning out
Head across seas, bout to turn it out
Coming back home to a furnish house
We three deep, What?, and we ain't get no sleep
We on the next flight, 25 a night, damn right
Plan is to keep the fam tight
Copping the Vipe and I ain't stopping at the light
Can't see the dice, ice to bright
Heard he with a pretty chick, you a idiot
Get a record deal and not take it serious
Plan to make hits for a long period
Hell of a living, shit being on television
Ball I'ma score every time there's an inning
I once had had a mill and it's just the beginning
Everybody want a pool, I need an ocean to swim in

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Your fault, So right (so right)
It makes me want more (it makes me want more)
Your fault, So tight (so tight)
You need an encore (give me an encore)

[Sheek]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what up, yo, hey yo, hey yo

Hey yo before I rock a show I pray to God in a huddle
Sheek laid back, you know I'm bout to bubble
All y'all hate that, trying to keep me in trouble
We take things serious, y'all do it for fun
Cause when we hit we stick like noodles when then done
International despite thee, West coast beef
I blew it down on Keenen Ivory
Wayan's, got the all with a grain for the pain
So if we conflict you get all in yo brain
You gonna play this like little kids play hoolahoop
From day til it's dark with the fat man scoop
Now you spook, you heard Lox about to drop
Pop the top, we got this in a can like Pringle
Heard one song, now you changing up your single
While I mingle, Sheek the black man gingle
In a club with two mommies, that's bilangual

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, what, what, yo yo yo yo

Now what y'all think we here for? aight then
Get this money, keep it tightened, right when
All y'all thought y'all was coming to get us
Cause we lost B.I.G., but he still wit us
Fooled y'all ass, y'all tools don't blast
All we do is make hot songs and use y'all cash
I hang my plaques in the bathroom
Cause I'm sill thinking bout making a hit
While I'm taking a shit
Player Haters be scraping the 6
For no reason, that don't even make no sense
I'm happy they made them with bullet prof glass tints
If you want beef, see you at the Bad Boy cook out
Get a new look out, pull your black book out
Who you know pal for enough to distribute
2.5 and that's just the tribute
Anything envolved with Benji's we with that
With the good comes the bad never forget that

[Chorus]","The Heist, Pt. 1"
The LOX,"[Jadakiss]
Yo, you can't fake it 
Life's only what you make it 
Front, be a snake, mess around, get your weight it 
Ex-school boy who want to go and try to take shit 
Found his body, in the projects, naked 
I ain't gonna lie, If I wasn't doing this now 
I'd probably'd be tied down, in a small town 
With my eyes on a couple of guys 
With their eyes on a couple of pies 
Cause I will survive 
Brains, is the key to the game 
If you ain't got none, what good is a shotgun? 
If you ain't got guns, then you better cop some 
'Cause the New World Order's around the block, dun 
Streets be where Lox get their props from 
Check us on the Internet, L-O-X dot com (lox.com) 
A worldwide message, I try to express it 
The best I could, for ya'll to cherish, till I perish 

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
I want to thank you, heavenly Father 
For shining your light on me 
It's been a long time 
Since I had someone to love me 
I owe my thanks to thee 

[Styles]
They never expressed, that life's a part of death 
They never go there, but you can blow here 
The 25 to life and greens from below 
Where, outta nowhere, you in the bus, hands is cuffed 
Can't call your Mom, dog, you know times is rough 
You was out yesterday, stressing a better way 
Funny thing, they always seem to lock down Kings 
And the thugs on the street just love to say, ""It's all foul."" 
Watch the honeys check your style 
Worthless, when they worship, what you purchase 
They only see ice, not me, under the surface 
What's the purpose? I just, go my way 
Know my way, 'till bullets blow my way 
Which they might, 'cause any night can change your life 
Keep your state of mind tight and remain alright 
It's plain to fight, but different to shoot 
And might do it 
If you ain't 10 different ways to get loot. 

[Chorus]

[Sheek]
Hey, yo, we handle rap like we do the street 
Holding heat 
It's them same crooked niggas 
Watching dough, ain't nothing sweet, word 
Buying beats is like copping grams 
Niggas got too many scams 
To give you garbage, slide the butters to their mans 
That's aiight, though 
'Cause even ready rock gets sold on our block 
Watch us turn nothing into nitro 
And we don't mingle 
'Cause none of us don't really know you 
From the heart, we never talk to strangers 
So why start? 
Anyway, we're rapping for this luxury shit 
I watch wild niggas blow 
See how plush shit can get 
But we ain't trying to kiss ass to blow up fast 
We gonna take our time and rely strictly on the rhyme 
If I, wasn't that cat, Sheek Lucian, that rap 
Would you still be my man 
And pass your bottle to my hand 
Would I be in the rain 
While you pass me in the Land 
Oh, you think by now that I don't already know your plan 
To get next to me and possibly sex me 
Then slip Ecstasy inside a nigga's Pepsi 
Money'll never amount to respect, be	 
And you don't want to test me 
'Cause God blessed me. 

[Chorus]

And I know 
I know that it could not happen without you 
I know it could not happen without you",I Wanna Thank You
The LOX,"[Chorus:]
If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we could do whatever
But you can't get no doe

Yo, since the Mona video you been trackin' me down
Tryin' to figure out how I look impersonal, Baby
Forget rooks tell me can you roll with crooks
The three hot niggas rising in the Billboards, nigga
We look to change from the big lands, big bitches
Big Benz tryin' to make D-O-E and,
The thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas
Crystal niggas, y'all finesse the rich style niggas
You didn't love me when my name was Sean
Now you should see how bitches act when the Benjamins come on
But I ain't hatin' em, you gotta scream the way females play
Quick schemes and Negligie to make a clean get-away
Fly thug where the Willies stay, and she pay nothing
Stash what you heard, gifts are frontin'
I stashin' mad chips gettin' drunk up with the China
Club, while you gettin' schemed 'cause you did a minor

I know she wit it, I better pray I could hit it
Black tire fair I gotta fresh pair of British
Ice Berg shirts along with Ice with it
Turquoise, 9-11 fortune in pent
The honey got a lot of Jags, You gotta fill it
Honey gotta a lot of bags, then she went inside to find her 
Lil'Kim when she set up her choice, like my voice
My thug style made her category
That's the realist shit I heard, that's my word
? I'm the nigga she deserves
I put em on the hole in ? rockin' furs
Liftin' weights and speak without using words
If she ain't proper I still gotta drop her
Sheik don't like her, had a dream that I shot her
I can't buy you ? you get nada
I'm the bounce with the chick that be lookin' a little hotter

[Chorus]

They was never mine for me to dump em
And just like checkers, after they make a move I'm a jump em
It's like this girlfriend I'm a keep it real,
Every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm cased up with whips
Guess what, I got more nuts than chips
And they gonna melt right in your mouth
Not in your hand, You know you ain't my girl
And I'm not your man
But do you still want to lick me?
Or is because I'm a ? Niggee, and I lone Biggie
And I don't mess with no fat ladies
But if you pay like you weigh then you can stay baby
We straight slide, gimme more like that
With this honey named ?, 'cause she blow like that
And when we finish don't look at me like I owe nothin'
'Cause if you really dig then let me know something

[Chorus; x2]",If You Think I'm Jiggy
The LOX,"(Puff) 
See, I want to get back to the love.
Let's start love over, come on.

[Chorus: Carl Thomas)
Let's start love over,
Back to the way things were. 
Forget about them,
'Cause all we got is us.
We can make it
Sad if we try.
I want to start love over.
Let's make it, do or die 

[Styles]
When I was nine years old,
I realized there was a road.
At the end, I would win lots of pots of gold.
Days, when I used to have my play clothes on,
I would make up my rhymes the middle of Voltron,
But you've learned what the herbs do.
Breaking curfew,
Hit the park when it's dark, make it stand like a podium.
Niggas had a box and a strip of linoleum.
Some break a boogie, but those that don't 
Was usually a fighter.
Rollin' easy riders,
Sending people to the store for a soda and a lighter.
A real cool cat that would let you keep a dollar,
But now things change, and it's the days of tomorrow.
Little kids is big now,
They'll push your wig now.
Can't send them to the store,
But you can send them for roll
And put them on my vine,
And give them one big push for all mankind.

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss] 
People still taking rapping for a joke,
A passing hope,
Or a phrase with a rope.
What ever happened to the caddies, white walls, and spokes? 
Crates of records, turn tables, plenty of folks,
Remember playing in the streets, touch football.
Look, y'all,
Somebody get mad and bounce with they football.
Twenty four hour block parties,
Everybody on the block pissing, you a dark hardy.
Adults used to think I was scheming,
But I was dreaming to one day make a hot album and have 'em all fiendin'.
Now, every time, that I rhyme I can tell that you like it,
Be nursing the tunes like the mind of a psychic.
Your mind is weary, floating like a dove,
Sweating and things, like you were making love.
Control the crowd so they can accept it.
Total concentration is the perfect method.

[Bridge:]
Where's the love? 
Somebody tell me,
Where's the love? 
Because we want to know.

(Puff) 
I remember everybody I loved, everybody.
It wasn't always player hating,
There wasn't jealousy and all this envy,
It was the love.

[Sheek]
Hey yo, hip hop 
Set out in the park.
What? 
We used to do it out in the dark
All night long till the cops made us go,
Or till somebody's moms pulled the extension cord from the window.
Lees on, thinking you fresh,
Trying to impress
Shorty, with the baby hair pushed down on her forehead.
Ponytail swaying, she hot,
Standing like she bowl-legged, but she not.
You remember the days? 
That's when crack was affecting blacks like that.
Just drink some Valentine Ale, little reefer,
Friday night go check out Star Child at the theater.
That's all corrupt.
Over rap you might get bust.
Say the wrong thing:
End up in a permanent sling.
Went from shell tops to hollow tops.
Used to rock the bus stop.
Now we electric slide from the cops.
Want some veterans in this,
That ain't keeping it real.
Now, with God, we chill over a record deal.
Always the good ones to go,
Never your enemies die.
Till this day, I wonder why they took my man B.I.
No time to yell rhymes in the microphone.
Take this more serious than just a poem.
Rock party to party
While you're out the door.
But tear it up, yo, let's start love over.

[Chorus]

[Bridge: x2]",Let's Start Rap Over
The LOX,"Yeah, the game of life
In this game it's not whether you win or lose
But how you played the game
Come on

Everything involves The Lox
Ask the niggas with the money in the safe
And the cats on cell blocks
Car parked in the lot
Door is locked
And the only time the phone is blocked is when home is hot
I announce the bounce
Smooth like an ounce
Blow more ways than one
Y'all niggas count
One Mississippi - you can't get with me
Two Mississippi - you never gon' hit me
Three Mississippi - can't no bitch trick me
Four Mississippi - won't no dog sick me
Five Mississippi - we in Mississippi
Twenty deep in the block
Real niggas rock with me
Blazing, reving in the black 9-11
Lox out of sight like Michael Knight and Kevin
Living dead
Hoes giving head to the Feds
Catch him with the calico
Light him up in bed

Livin' the life, either you rise or fall
It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball
It's a two-way street be rich or poor
Livin' the life, either you rise or fall
It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball
It's a two-way street be rich or poor

My niggas order parts for cars like motherfuckin' pizza
For years
While you get all yours from Sears
What!? Nigga even my guns be Ger-man
Links, Cu-ban
Rugs, Persian
Now we can take this another level Pa-Pa
And simply bust your pinata you hot-sa
Lox take blocks
Turn 'em into Fort Knox
Cake wasn't blowin' here
Till we started going there
What!? I ain't hateing you cause you's a little richer
But you old and I'm young, so that mean I think quicker
When bitch drunk
I'm bent up
I bounce with the land blow
(?) Pump the missile
Black berry molassi
Flossin' with the bad mama sita
My chi-ca
Be ten cent
Job with the government
Tap the Fed line
So when they raid I'll be lovin' it

Livin' the life, either you rise or fall
It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball
It's a two-way street be rich or poor
Livin' the life, either you rise or fall
It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball
It's a two-way street be rich or poor

I swear under oath no bullshit will any Lock take
Cause we stop drama like anti-lock brakes
High stakes
Politic, pies and cakes
Real niggas do dirt, tell lies, then skate
What up son?
What you bullshittin' bout now huh?
Where we from?
Don't matter cause we gettin' it done
Land Rover, double sun roof
Bulletproof
Tangaray and grapefruit
Got me hurlin' on my boots
Man please
Spit it out, twist the trees
5-40 I fly when I'm dissin' the d's
Deep Dish P.
Sip Dom  P. with ease
First two words I ever learn, cock and squeeze
Ain't about that
Trying to do without that
Makin' niggas fuck up their budget
Time to get their paper route back
L-O-X three letter word, black mall
With every last member of the team on the job
Whether ir be controllin' the street
Holdin' the heat
Really don't matter to me
Long as we eat

Livin' the life, either you rise or fall
It's a two-way street be large or small
Livin' the life, either you die or ball
It's a two-way street be rich or poor
Livin' the life, either you rise or fall

Another small town cat with a million dollar fetish 
Learned my first lesson in jail from a peasant 
Always seem pleasant 
Happy to be present 
Said he past due, shouldn't have been in the essence 
Streets is like your girl, treat it like your wife 
You can flirt around with drugs, but don't hit the pipe 
You can mess around with guns but death ain't right 
Hold your breath, next step, cause life ain't right 
If you with the wrong cats then your cyph ain't tight 
Styles hit the darkside, show them the light 
Life ended to the ice that freezes m.c.'s 
Friend of the flame, burn 'em in one game 
Tell oxygen he ain't hopping in 
He a little time nigga, I ain't thinking of stopping him 
Catch up first, you stretch up worse than them 
Been experts and done less work than them 
With no album, we net worth more than them 
These cats didn't think that the Lox could do it 
Got a hundred different styles that will guide you through it 
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid 
Never crack sidewalks or ride the sewers 
You got some fly shit, but my shit 
Is like the whole city fallin out the sky bitch 
Loud tracks 
I'm the quiet loud ass 
Quick to set it off on your fucking foul ass 
Make six digits eight and cop a palace 
Make every rapper sick and call me malace 
Y'all niggas never know what the Stylez have 
Some shit in the stash that would crack a cow's back 
In a hundred pieces in they ass, and how's that? 
Never answer back, I'm the cancer on the track 
Just think, I could blink, and make the Pink Panther black 

[Chorus: x2]
Who's not to be fucked with? 
That's me 
Who's to be fucked with? 
That's them 
Why don't you watch my back while I go ask them? 
And if they want beef later on I splash them 
And if they want to flow, right now I thrash them 
Should I give it to them new style or old fashion 

[Stylez]
Do I have to break down the walls 
Stay off the floor 
I'm the general dog, I start the war 
Make every m.c. never spit again 
When I leave 'em empty 
No guts, no chest, no brain, no game 
Stylez go broke, I'm a rob the folk train 
I feel no pain 
Steal cocaine 
Fuck black thugs that run through whole gangs 
Anytime that I want it nigga, better listen 
Blunt is the magic wand, I'm the magician 
Stylez is the virus, ain't no physician 
With an anecdote that can stop my collision 
Before you start asking, I'm a start splashing 
When I come through, it's like ten planes crashing 
Twenty ships, full of thugs, all of them is bastards 
Mashed up, looking through binocs, about to crash in 
What's the next issue? 
Sheek did official 
Called Spielberg, cops get tissue 
So you can rock in the sky when feds come and get you 
Next question is where nasa at? 
We need a hundred G's, can fly, when traffic bad 
When we down on the craps 
We plasmic gats 
Telling you now you can't fuck with dinero 
Got a lot of space when it seem real narrow 
Sagittarius style, spitting out arrows 
Hundred at a time, killing a hundred heroes

We on the next flight, 25 a night, damn right
Plan is to keep the fam tight
Copping the Vipe and I ain't stopping at the light
Can't see the dice, ice to bright
Heard he with a pretty chick, you a idiot
Get a record deal and not take it serious
Plan to make hits for a long period
Hell of a living, shit being on television
Ball i'ma score everytime there's an inning
I once had had a mill and it's just the beginning
Everybody want a pool, I need an ocean to swim in

All ya'll hate that, tryin to keep me in trouble
We take things serious, ya'll do it for fun
Cuz when we hit we stick like noodles when then done

Pop the top, we got this in a can like Pringle
Heard one song, now you changing up your single
While I mingle, Sheek the black man gingle
In a club with two mommies, that's bilangual

Now what ya'll think we here for? aight then
Get this money, keep it tightened, right when
All ya'll thought ya'll was coming to get us
Cuz we lost B.I.G., but he still wit us
Fooled ya'll ass, ya'll tools don't blast
All we do is make hot songs and use ya'll cash

Cuz I'm sill thinking bout making a hit
While I'm taking a shit
Playa Haters be scraping the 6
For no reason, that don't even make no sense
I'm happy they made them with bullet prrof glass tints

Who really the best rapper since B.I.G. ain't here?
Y'all know the answer to that when Kiss ain't here
When you see me, don't ask me nothin' about us
And don't definitely ask me nothin' about
Fuck it
You owe me one, I owe you two
I would of smacked you wit' the burner
But I know you'd sue, and I ain't talkin' to him
I'm talkin' to you
Matter of fact, I'm talkin' to y'all
Life is like walkin' a yard
Nigga'll stab you wit' a fork in the heart
And The Source got muthafuckas thinkin' they hot
Like my dope
Got fiends thinkin' they shot
When you thinkin' of the best, nigga
Think of The Lox
I'll cut ya fuckin' hand off if ya pinky ring's hot
Then come through ya block in a sticky green drop
Hop out
Let off fifty-three shots
Wouldn't care if I hit fifty-three cops
Giuliani might as well be merkin' niggas
'Cause the time that he givin' out is hurtin' niggas
And all these record labels jerkin' niggas
And you never was a thug
You's a workin' nigga
And you heard that shit right there?
I started that
Don't make me put somethin' up in ya Starter hat
No matter who you are, or where you from
Screw all of that
I'm not tryin' to hear that, son

[Chorus x 2]
Now, who the fuck y'all want? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck y'all need? (Jadakiss!)
And who the fuck gon' bleed?
All y'all hataz 'cause none of y'all niggas (Can't fuck wit' Jada!)

[Jadakiss]
Don't you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip
That's gon' get the second half of the clip
And all I'm sayin': it'll be the other nigga in the front of the the whip
Runnin' his lip, wit' a gun on his hip
Feel me, dog?
Everybody walk the walk till they run into Kiss
Then they get stabbed, or hung, or stung wit' the fifth
How you think ya man hard when son on my dick?
'Cause I can get his ass, body, plus front him a brick
Got a chick named Super-head
She give super head
Just moved in the buildin', even gave the super head
I cop big guns that spit super lead
So, play Superman, end up super dead
Call me Kiss, or the kid from The Lox
That'll twist ya moms out and do a bid wit' ya pops
We was in jail
You probably won't get no mail
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales
When ya CEO know you can't fuck wit' I
I make a million by June
I'm sayin' fuck July
And I beg you to try me while I'm holdin' the Tommy
I'm a have ya body all over the lobby
I already helped y'all
I'm about to melt y'all
Tell the truth, dog
I ain't never felt y'all

Felt dumb when I was young 
I used to wish I was on 
I'm a stay blunted and red with one in the head 
Niggas thinkin' they the don
Till their shit get bombed 
I put four in your shootin' arm 
Two in your legs 
Like ten in your chest 
The last one in your head 
I give you the whole clip
Like you cheated and stole shit 
Knocked off the pack
Flossed and no chips 
You know the business 
Empty rap kill your co-defendant

One pair of clothes, two hos and buggy with that 
Want to beef me?
Y'all niggas is borrowin' heat 
Callin' all across town to borrow a full pound 
Meanwhile this nigga got his guns to your noggin'
While your man with the heat is with some bitch up in the project 
He clappin' at you, you duckin', makin' you dance 
You should have spent it on some guns 
Instead of Iceberg pants 
What, L.O.X. off top
Pullin' our triggers 
With our guns on our lap
We ride around like Cali niggas  (West side!) 
Target motherfuckers
Cold hearted motherfuckers 
'Stead of young dumb your moms, and whoever she got with her 
There's a new-born in the house
Then I'm killin' the babysitter 
Y'all niggas all clowns in Sheek eyes 
Your moms would wear glasses
With the nose disguise around me 
Talkin' greasy 
Y'all like watermelons

I never been a brother to front 
I be in L.A. wearin' any colors I want 
Rock guns like shirts
Block under the punk 
And I put somethin' hot
Anyone of you chumps 
And I know a few of you want to get my watch 
But it be a funeral if you get my watch 
It ain't nothing y'all can do to stop the Lox' wealth 
Run up in a gun store; cop the top shelf 
The crack-game is dead
All they want is weed now 
Chicks that I went to school with, a seed now 
You know Kiss, stocky, bald head, light brown 
Ice down, in my Roll look like night-town 
To all y'all, lil' Jada's for the thousandth time 
I recall hittin' your moms or writin' your rhymes 
And just because you might have seen me

Knowing the work that these real thugs put in
We too legit
Let me hear you rap something 'bout us
I'm a break the hands of the man who wrote your shit
We take minks off backs
Them grimy niggas in clubs that make niggas walk
With them bodyguard cats
I'm glad I'm free
I feel like Harriet Tubman came and got me
From the white man property
It's all glitz and glitter, but no cash you getting
You hear the difference in that shit that I'm spittin'

That's street shit, and that's the way it has to be
Myself, Sheek Louch, and I'm still MTV
I can talk about guns
Go out, smack some nuns
Then flip and do a song with country music and shit
Don't ever play LOX for no fucking retard
'Cause your dough ain't that long that you can't see God
Plus these rap niggas out here respect the god
They know we spit that shit, so they respect our sound
They know how hard a motherfucker is and water that's down
Here, that's that shit right there
I swear from Yonkers, motherfucker
We'll bust in the air
Ain't nobody killin' clouds over here
Respect us

We bust how you bust

Hey, yo, this here is for them cats that wild nonstop
Can't dance, just play the club and bop
No respect for the law
Fuck security, son
'Cause you big; that ain't stopping me from bustin' my gun
It's a fact that fire burns and shit stink
It's also a fact that your vest only protectin' your chest
You ain't think about your head when you was talkin' that mess
Or this knife
Across your face; scar you for life
Now do you really want to rock that ice?
Heh heh
Do your security really love your life
Or do they just want their check?
You think they gon' take one in the neck
For a nigga with no respect
For his crew
Man, we don't wear half on Chinese food
Slept in the same bed
Same chick gave us head
Brothers, and we ain't gon' stop till we all dead
Ain't shit gon' change
Just the dough gon' change
Fuck a Bentley
I'm good with a rubber-band-colored Range
I empty a clip at you 
You send nothing in exchange
Y'all niggas mad soft 
No heart, all brains
But what's smart when a dumb-dumb burst your heart?
I'm done now, but first hold up, hold your applause
I got one question to ask y'all: do y'all niggas want war?

[Chorus: x6]",Bring It On
The LOX,"Yeah, yeah Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to, something epic y'all know?
Well we hustle out of a sense of, hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we 'come addicted
Sorta like the fiends we accustomed to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right
What do you bring to the table?

While I'm watching every nigga watching me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked then clap from closed feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see, from selling 'caine
Til brains was fried to a fricassee, can't lie
At the time it never bothered me, at the bar
Getting my thug on properly, my squad and me
Lack of respect for authority, laughing hard
Happy to be escaping poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation
For dips, four percent pertation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more, Big Willie my game has grown prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, grateful dim the light
Channel 7 news, round seven jewels, hand getting the mic
Forgetting all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure
Lock my body can't trap my mind, easily
Explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speaking in codes since I sense you peeking
The INXS rental, don't be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog, what you trying to get into?
Viva, Las Vegas, see ya, later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no fraud Willie's present gambling they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sipping margaritas
Yeah, can I live?
Can I live?

My mind is infested, with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity, my crew and me
Commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it in tangible goods
Platinum Rolexed it, we don't lease
We buy the whole care, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation, EXPLODE
On detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it balls to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it, even righteous minds go through this
True this, history school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and, watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous, dreams of
Getting cream let's do this, against T-D-S
So I keep one eye open like, C-B-S, ya see me
Stressed right?  Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

'Cause' them niggas that you went to school with 
Will catch you while you in your new whip 
And turn your brains into Cool Whip 
Niggas that you running round getting ass with 
Ain't gon' help you do nothing but carry your casket 
Got the nerve to ask Kiss why I smoke so much 
And how I'm such a young nigga that seem to know so much 
While you was running round pumping for niggas 
I was listening 
And you still pumping for niggas 
I'm coming through visiting 
You heard, L-O-X came through in a yellow Lex 
And hop out with the Air Force One's with yellow checks 
And you liable to see me Dolo, icing the Rolo 
Burner under the Polo, a lot of y'all is homos 
Funny style niggas never down with me 
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee 
I'll empty your house, back of your cribs, smacking your kids 
Bullets going through your leather, cracking your ribs 
Don't even hit me on my hip if I ain't give you a call

Now I'm getting bigger checks, conference calls with bigger 'xecs 
Bigger bracelets with bigger begets,

Learn the ropes, stone rip if you soft, you pissing me off 
Call me S.P., and I spit on your boss 
You can die cause this shit might happen to me 
But I'mma still happen to be, packin' the three
Fuck with bitches that be wrappin' the keys 
And the niggas that bug over drug money, clappin' the D 
Shoot in the breeze, nine in the boot, full of trees 
One in the morning, catch me with a gun on the corner 
Let you know it's all real and you can front if you want to 
I understand, fuck it dog, die in the can 
I say you pussy, you won't die for your right-hand man 
As well as your left, niggas trip, fell into death 
They touch you, only thing else to say is fuck you 
 
A-yo, y'all niggas ain't hardcore, all my niggas is homicide 
What you know about getting shot, letting the drip dry 
Letting the spit fly, seeing sparks whiz by 
Putting a MASH on niggas like Klinger and Horgi 
So soft you smushy, I blast 'til your shit is gushy 
Should be the head Cat in the Broadway play, you pussy 
Fuck with Sheek, Ouija board spell ""Death"" 
You can talk that beef shit, I hope that deep shit 
Be as deep as you inside the fucking cement 
Or you can deep sea dive, with no scuba gear 
I'll drown you with your snorkel on, bitch, breathe out of there 
Whole team rich, never seen a summer like this 
Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand 
When it comes to coke, I can make a snowman, shit 
Play in this shit make a angel with it 
And I don't give a fuck about that 380 that y'all share 
Between the 10 y'all with the same 8 bullets from last year 
When I bust I use snubs, denim flee in the spot 
The hand I write with need a oven glove, my shit so hot 
I want the most, Roley only work when it's next to my post 
Fuck a present gimme a yacht master, regular bezzy 
Then I'm good when I'm in the hood and I'm on the block 
You got a gut feeling about shit, nigga, that means you shot, what 

If you hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you 
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you 
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you 
Only my man's blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you

But I'll put six in your stomach nigga 
Lace your food 
Scream ""Fuck Every Rapper"" that hate that I'm rude 
But that's that SP shit, you can take it or move 
We can let the bullets spill, till we all get killed 
There's only six nice rappers

Niggas die everyday from talking that dumb shit 
That where they're from shit 
All that mean to me is you can get your gun quick 
Just another dumb bitch 
Go to church to get the holy ghost 
I did my dirt and got the holy ghost 
Look at the world through a niggas eyes 
Don't be a bitch, you gonna live and die 
Rivin' in the sky, but no love when you slither by 
I pray to god that we make it to heaven 
But the only thing we makin' is channel eleven 
You know four, five and seven, hot as fuck 
And every rapper be dead, if they were hotter than us 
But since niggas still alive they should be telling you somethin'

Don't you be that clown nigga in the back of the whip 
That's gon' get the second half of the clip 
And all I'm saying, it'll be the other nigga in the front of the the whip 
Running his lip, wit a gun on his hip 
Feel me dog? 
Everybody walk the walk 'til they run into Kiss 
Then, they get stabbed, or hung, or stung wit the fifth 
How you think ya man hard when son on my dick? 
'cause I can get his ass body, plus front him a brick 
Got a chick named Super-head 
She give super-head 
Just moved in the building, even gave the super head 
I cop big guns that spit super lead 
So, play Superman, end up super dead 
Call ne Kiss, or the kid from The Lox 
That'll twist ya moms out and do a bid wit ya pops 
We was in jail, you probably won't get no mail 
And if you pumped on my block, you won't get no sales 
When ya CEO know you can't fuck wit I 
I make a million by June 
I'm saying fuck July 
And I beg you to try me while I'm holding the Tommy 
I'ma have ya body all over the lobby 
I already helped y'all 
I'm about to melt y'all 
Tell the truth, dog 
I ain't never felt y'all

The nigga with the hot flow and a cold wrist
Can flow always, sit on 4 K's
Then wait for a drought and flood 'em with all 'dres
Ride or die chick, hand do a B.I.
Give a nigga up north some ass on a V.I.
And she blackout when she in the mall
Got the brand new spring Prada shit in the fall
Don't matter what size panties, fitting her small
And she don't got no problem hittin' us all
And she said she got a man, but he in the fed
And she miss him so much that she pee in the bed
So you know I had to lighten her raw, fighting the dog
Pushing the seat back gettin' right in the fall
Make her use a fake credit card twice in a store
Might make you do it tomorrow you triflin' whore

[Styles Paniro]
I need a chick that ryde or die, pullin' the 5
Gettin' high with the Coogi frames over her eyes
Sweet to the tail, still won't fuck in a Benz
'cause she bought me a Polo coat and a couple of Timbs'
Doobie was rap, both in the movie with gats
Gave me head 'cause the movie was wack, word
Toasted her crib, blow in the fridge, she needed to work
I died and that bitch gon' put weed in my hearse
Gamed her to death, tattooed my name on her neck
You don't want to see me bangin' the left, hittin' the gas
That bitch out the window poppin' heat in yo' ass
You could catch holiday in to Holiday Inn
With a bad bitch swallowin' gin, word
And if it got to do with money count Holiday in
With my ride or die bitch that'll body your man
You don't like me as a artist, she gon' body your fam'

Uh, uh, yo
Yo, when you see Sheek, don't look at me as Sheek from The L.O.X.
Look at me as that cat that know how to box
Know about glocks, know about slingin' them rocks
Know about runnin' from cops and switchin' up spots
How to get rich, know about thuggin' a bitch
Fuck 'em in the park, fuck a sweet as the Ritz
They like that shit, and I ain't gotta spend no checks
Fuck diamonds, all they really want is rough ass sex
And they name, shout it out when I'm up at Flex
I get drunk with bitches that don't get drunk
Don't get high, have 'em doing drive-by's
Shit they never did, forgetting about they kids
Moms babysitting, ain't seen her in a week
I'm a bad influence to parents that hate Sheek
I need a ride or die bitch that'll take this coke
Out of town, and come back and breakdown when I'm broke, what","Ryde or Die, B****"

Fly in his truck

Mami on my side she weeded I'm henneseyed up 
Wet like flipper 
Dick on my zipper 
Kind of soft 
Waiting for this bitch to finish her weed to suck me off 
I'm done now 
Step out my truck then peep out my style 
Place a hundred in this bum cup in front of Mr. Child 
Glock 19 
Laser beam 
Fuck it no vest today 
No stress today , that's how I'm feeling today 
But if y'all shoot you think I won't put this bitch in my way 
I got love for my niggas that's deeper than lava 
Hotter than lava 
You point him out I'll pop the revolver 
Two years in jail and I don't need no package or nothing 
Sheek Louch true to this shit 
Y'all niggas is fronting 
We some evil motherfuckers you can tell when we smirk 
Comes to money we ain't got no patience like doctors who don't work 
We drink till it don't hurt 
And the pain go away 
Now who you know out there who's fucking with Sheek, Styles, and J 
C'mon 

[Styles] 
What comes around goes around and I'm waiting to die 
I smoke weed in a cloud make my face in the sky 
I get blasted off the liquor, sell drugs, carry a 5th 
Fuck with my dogs 
Till they put me in a morgue 
And even when I'm alone it's me and my toast 
Me and my ghost 
I wonder who get heated the most 
If you didn't live the life you probably couldn't relate 
I turn your face into pudding in the hood with an 8th 
Niggas beef over crack sales 
Scrap over hood rats 
Die over dice games 
You fucking with us 
And I'ma still pop shit riding up on a bus 
Like I'ma fuck a nigga up when I'm outta these cuffs 
And blow three niggas down 'cause only cowards'll bluff 
Play it sweet when it's sour as fuck 
Calicoed up 
Money and the jewels and the powder is up 
I'ma make a nigga leak like I hit him with dust 

[Jadakiss] 
Nowadays it cost money to breathe 
That's why I tote around three 
Ankle to waist and one in my sleeve 
Fuck security y'all can give that money to me 
'cause when the bullets go off they be under the tree 
I'm at your chick's house bagging up 
Groupies styled out 
The cool-Aid too sweet and the phone don't dial out 
You don't gotta like me 
I show up to your wedding 
Rocking a white tee 
Your wife like oh-wee 
And if I dance wit her 
Then I got a chance wit her 
But I ain't gonna do her 
I'ma wait till after the honeymoon to screw her 
And let niggas run through her 
For y'all that's behind that wall blocking the street 
Homemade do-rags off the top of the briefs 
Everybody get they turn to live 
You just gotta know when it's your turn don't burn your bridge 
And all the real niggas will die the worms'll live 
And that's real fucked up but that's how shit is 
Scream it

Now you can quote me on this
I bust my gun
Also quote me on this
I handle my biz
I knew it was my house when Run was sayin it was his
I ain't lying
Ain't no cords or no steam in this iron
But it is a permanent press
Have these 38 shells spray starch your chest
Leave you stiff
Coroners make ashes of you
In rap I'm like God nigga forever above you
If I don't do it all I just dial my phone
And you get sprayed through your clothes like you put on cologne
If it's not violence or drugs I have nothing to spit
I be lying if I talk some spiritual shit
Like Kirk Franklin and them
Y'all just ain't me
I can't tell you about God but I can tell you about a key
And what I'll do to God's children if they jerk me
Hurt me , never , that'll be a sin
I'ma put the Bible to your head and shoot through Matthew verse 10
What
C'mon niggas
What

[Chorus: x2]
You told me you would bust your guns for me
(Yeah bust your gun dog)
You said you'd always sling your pounds
(Sling the hydro green)
Now you're away and you're all that I need
(You're all that I need baby)
But L-O-X will hold it down
(You know the LOX gonna hold it)

[Jadakiss]
I'm back in the game
I still ride the back of the train
And sit right next to Jake with a package of Caine
Niggas say he realer than me you call him a liar
I got the Audi T T the same color as fire
You just getting a name
Putting shit in the game
Stop faking
I have your do-rag looking Jamaican
Holey as the water in the front of the church
Then find you with no back plus one in your earth
I can't wait for the day you get murked
Cause I'ma throw a free party at the Tunnel and give out work
I love myself , my family , and love my son
Love my niggas and love white Air Force Ones
And besides that I'm open off the dro and the guns
And the head you could get from a hoe in the slums
Niggas always act silly till you show em the milly
Then they got the nerve to ask you why you wanna kill me
Uhh

[Chorus: x2]

[Styles]
I know it ain't right
For me to swear to God
But I swear to God that I'll murder you dog
And I know it ain't right
For me to sell dope
Rob stores but I still gotta run from the law
Twenty niggas in the clique
How all of us pour
In a three room apartment and we all on the floor
I reflect to the days I thought of busting the whip
Now I come through the scene and niggas cuffing they bitch
Feel good to see Kiss spend a buck on his wrists
Or Sheek fronting on a jet ski with a Puerto Rican chick
I don't rock no jewels
But I pops my tools
And I work my coupe to do a buck 68
P hit you in the head like a dutch to the face
Or a cup full of liquor
Come and fuck with you nigga
Cause I make drug money
Gotta take blood from me
If you wanna prove a point pull a joint shoot dummies

Hey yo
Yo I'ma B-boy standing in my B-boy stance 
Glock on my hip is big is the dick in my pants 
You don't want nothing wit sheek you soft as fuck 
I leave a single shotgun shell on top of your truck 
Wit a horseshoe to let you know you pressin' ya luck 
You don't want nothing wit kiss, nothing wit styles 
You don't want to end up food for the crocodiles 
I'd take the gun off ya waste and smack ya  
And turn around and point it at ya mink and give you one 
I'm the reason why ya peeps not in ICU 
Cause believe me when you ain't watching I see you 
From the Hamptons to the place where you like to eat 
I put something in them mams you keep thinking is sweet 
I'm in the bushes all night calm wit' the Tommy 
Waiting for you to skinny dip wit' that mommy 
While she waiting for the night I'm waiting for her flight

Get it out ya head now

Show a little love now 
Pump it in the club now

Yo if you should die tonight 
It's cause I said peel his cap 
We on Ruffryders now 
How real is that 
It's the kiss of death everybody know J- face 
Us gettin off similar to OJ's case 
Just better rhymes and better beats involved 
Less politics more of the streets involved 
Things always go smooth when the heats involved 
Sign today or get beat tomorrow 
First one talking that family shit 
And get a lot of doe and don't give the family shit 
I don't care how many ? you wrote 
I just want to see how you gonna dance when your neck get broke 
If y'all do fall down I'ma scoop the ? 
No shiny suits 
Everybody boots and jeans 
The industry is one thing being real is another 
That means I'll steal your mother 

[Chorus: x2]
 
[Styles]
Yo if you left the peak balling I don't feel yo ass 
I wish duke was still alive and they killed yo ass 
You can keep an industry but don't you come to the hood 
I got a thousand niggas like me and they feel like suge 
If you think I'm beefing for nothing then rob me dog 
I'm from the hood 
And I ain't bee robbed before 
Tell you screw all the paper work 
You can lie in dirt 
Walk through the valley nigga tell me if the iron hurt 
Ruff rider now cause that's where the bombs at 
And I tell niggas fuck that car jack 
Take the roley out the air put the don back 
Can't wear shiney suits on combat 
Guess I got personal beef 
You worse then a thief 
Probably be your man that'll work you to sleep 
We goin put the guns down and we ain't bringing a crew 
You got friends that hate yo ass more than we do nigga

Next to koochie freak those 
Tickets keep those 
And you can mail to my postbox down in Melrose

Posted on cop walls 
I'm that eighteen and up 
Mamis on my balls

But that legendary nigga my pops 
I bust shots like bums at a bar but far

Everything about this cat be plush 
And I'm quick to do dirt since I'm through your shirt 
Like nothing 
Lift a arm I hit those under your wing 
Yo why you following this cat 
Hey he about to get pushed back 
You could poke your chest out in the street 
That's cool 
But in a bing this fool 
Was like Louis Rich meat 
We don't run from y'all 
We scatter for guns on y'all 
What you know about two 380's inside a basketball 
And when it's beef 
Store on his side with burners on Coronas 
We the best that ever did it 
If you need us telephone us 
What the fuck nigga

'cause I take the kids shopping and send em on bus trips 
Hoppin out a rough six 
With sweats and scuffed kicks 
I supply all the dealers and tell em to stuff nix 
I done signed every autograph and took every flick 
I'm quite sure that I coulda hit 
Every chick 
But I didn't ones that I did gave em heavy dick 
All day 
The LOX flow hotter than broadway 
Election time tryin na cop blow in the hallway 
And their ain't enough plates for y'all to eat with me 
Stingy nigga but I share my slugs equally 
I put half where your waist at 
And half where your face at 
Yo we in from a new spot let somebody taste that 
From your street rappin's only one of my plans 
I got dirty south niggas payin a hundred a gram 
And I could care less how much you shift the scan 
However you get it you supposed to hit your man 
But we don't hold the grudges 
We control the budgets 
And do whatever the fuck we want to do nigga fuck it

Or catch one early

What type of shit you on? 
You better throw your boots on, and your un-flameable suits on

Every day I show another how I love a slaughter (what) 
Plug your daughter 
With more holes than swiss cheese (come on) 
Attack the bitch and stop for the leach (come on) 
With these, I shoot the breeze 
And its thought, enough keys from the cubans to build a fucking fort (what) 
I'm caught up in something that I can't control 
Trying to get a hold of a bank role and stroll 
Catch bodies like a cold. And stay sick (uh) 
So face it, make me chase it, I take your life and erase it (what) 
Waste it, in the fucking streets 
'Cause It ain't worth shit(come on) 
The undertaker take your ass under the earth (come on) 
Quicker, I love money, but the scam is hot (uh) 
So I snatch up my man and hit the gambling spot (uh) 
20 grand is got, one shot and you got less 
What use to his chest, is a mess under his fucking vest.","Ryde or Die, Bitch"

The Lucksmiths,"If it's not raining you can see right down the hill from my friend's window 
To the church at the foot of the council flats that I pass when I walk home 
And here I am with time on my hands and newsprint on my elbows 
And she's all heart 
But I'm all thumbs 
And we're both just skin and bones 
My life is changing 
Sometimes it feels as though it changes with the weather 
It was winter for a while but now the sun is shining through 
She laughs at that old saying ‘let a smile be your umbrella' 
I tell her ‘the next time that it's raining I will hold it over you' 
I like the way that she looks at me 
I like every little bit of this 
When she's here I'm always happy 
And when she's not I'm happyish 
Today it's raining 
There is nowhere I would rather be than this room 
Let's close the doors until the air hangs heavy with wet wool 
I'm feeling reckless: let's have breakfast in the middle of the afternoon 
She's all smiles 
And I'm also 
And we're always wonderful",Shine on Me

But it's all up in the air
I made some sandwiches
And I got myself a garden chair
And forty-five balloons
One sunny afternoon

I suppose it's not surprising
I'm three thousand feet high and rising

Miles above your backyard
San Pedro's just a postcard
Don't call me a nincompoop
Just call me the coast guard

The Lucksmiths,"For five months he was dry
Feb til July
But he found a little song
Wrapped up in a dream
Gave some thought to the rhymes
Put a little work into the chorus line
But it was really just a dream
Just a solid, good night's sleep

And all those times in the back of the bus
That helped you get through high school
Rockin' in the back of the bus
Rockin' in the back of the bus
All those north coast girls were laughing at you
Back in high school",Beach Boys Medley

This is where the song begins
Pinch a hair from the tip of your tongue
Close your eyes and fill your lungs
Here is where her neck begins
Feel the blood inside your skin
It's moving

Blink the day from the side of your eyes
Here is where the road meets sky
The turning tyres on the tar
And the shapely shadow of your car
I'm moving through the air that's moving too
That little darkness follows you
Back to where her neck begins
And back to fingers on the strings
That are moving

Moving so fast it goes past
You don't notice it move
Moving so slow that you don't even know that it's moving

She left a trail of happiness and misery

She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her

The Lullaby Orchestra,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
The Lullaby Orchestra,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
