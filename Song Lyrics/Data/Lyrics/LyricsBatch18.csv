Chrisette Michele,"Boy, you're so sexy, you think you got it made
You smile when you lie, get away from me
You're talking out two sides of your face
I'm supposed to go along, not OK

I'm so guarded, I've been hurt, see
I'm so cold, now someone burned me
Yeah I like you, yeah you like me
But I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see, oh
You got me guarded like an army grenade
Don't hurt me, I don't have what it takes
If you wonder why I'm throwing you shade, your charades

I like models, athletes, I like rappers
I like different kinds of shapes, different swaggers
Oh, oh, but I can see beyond a face and a kiss
Oh, if something's deeper I'm so hard I won't miss

I'm so guarded, I've been hurt, see
I'm so cold, now someone burned me
Yeah I like you, yeah you like me
But I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see, I can see
You got me guarded like an army grenade
Don't hurt me, I don't have what it takes
If you wonder why I'm throwing you shade
I see, your charades

Crossing the line is something I would never do
Me and your brother
We’ve been cool since back in middle school
And now I’m thinking pitiful
Two crosses on the spiritual
I am counting dead presidents off in the living room
Feeling you masseuse, yeah they call me Deuce
That's short for seducing, introduce you to my coupe
Coupe, this is baby! Baby, this is Coupe
Those that acting shady, I put them in the caboose
The end to the end, I’m talking me and you
Who? Ain’t no I, I hit it for like an hour
Hit it like ow, she gon' need a towel
And she like I!
I can see, your charades

Don't play me, I'm not a show
I know you did it before
I'm not that girl
No, I'm not that broad
Let's get along
Respect me or get gone
I ain't about that life dot com period
I ain't about that life dot com period

I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see, your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see your charades
You got me guarded like an army grenade
Don't hurt me, I don't have what it takes
If you wonder why I'm throwing you shade,
It's your charades",Charades
Chrisette Michele,"Let tonight
Be this lonely
Hold on tight
To one girl only
The memories, of how you hold me

Morning won't be like the nighttime
I can’t wait 'til sunrise
I can’t wait 'til my eyes open again
And I know I’ll smile in the daytime
Waiting for the sunlight
Everything will be alright
I know it will
Just gotta get through the night

Favorite songs
I’d lean on my pillow
If love is lost is lost is lost
I cried tears of sorrow
I will find true love tomorrow

Morning won't be like the nighttime
I can’t wait 'til sunrise
I can’t wait 'til my eyes open again
And I know I’ll smile in the daytime
Waiting for the sunlight
Everything will be alright
I know it will
Just gotta get through tonight

Just give me one night to fix all the problems
Tonight, I miss the crying until the morning
Tonight, when I finally realized our mistake
Torn, I’m torn, baby I

Morning won't be like the nighttime
I can’t wait 'til sunrise
I can’t wait 'til my eyes open again
And I know I’ll smile in the daytime
Waiting for the sunlight
Everything will be just fine
I know it will
Just gotta get through the night",Get Through the Night
Chrisette Michele,"I have these big windows in  my place.
Half of my bedroom is just glass, so
Every morning when I wake up
I wake up to the beautiful sun and the sky in my face.
Bad part is I'm afraid of the dark.
So night time isn't always sweet.

My favourite part of a relationship,
Is holding each other through the night.
Safety you know.
So the hardest part of breaking up for me
Is sleeping alone.
I wanna hear you breathe,
That quiet time is quality time to me.
When I left my last love,
I cried myself to sleep in the beginning
Finally
I told myself the morning won't be like the night time.
So if I can't do anything else,
I just gotta get through the night.",Interlude (In My Bed - Sleeping Alone)
Chrisette Michele,"I just wanna be here for you.
I know it's just I've been hurt so bad.
I can understand that, but I'm not that dude.
I'm into you, I just
Listen, can you hear that?
Yeah
You know what that is?
Yes, your heartbeat
That's you beating. You're my heartbeat",Interlude (In My Heart - Convo with Boyfriend)
Chrisette Michele,"I think I need a lifeline
It's like I'm in a crazy game
And I don't have the words to say
The wind is but a fiction
I might need a lifetime
I'll never know the perfect play
Hitting this day by day
But I've got good intentions
Look me in the eye
Do you think I'm fly
I can tell you into me
So why you acting shy?
Lay down all your cards
I won't make it hard
Let me be the winner of your heart, whoa

This game is like a gamble
Here's my heart to handle
Need you to be gentle
You should let me win
I'm not your heart of playing
Don't know what to say
I'm tryna catch a break
You should let me win, oh, oh, oh
You should let me win, oh, oh, oh
Uh, whoa

I never been a loser, and I don't wanna be one now
I always give away somehow,
Why should this be different?
I felt it when I kissed you
Drove me just a little bit wild
I always knew I liked your style
I never thought I would be with ya
Look me in the eye,
Do you think I'm fly
I can tell you into me
So why you acting shy?
Lay down all your cards
I won't make it hard
Let me be the winner of your heart, whoa

This game is like a gamble
Here's my heart to handle
Need you to be gentle
You should let me win
I'm not your heart of playing
Don't know what to say
I'm tryna catch a break
You should let me win, oh, oh, oh
You should let me win, oh, oh, oh
Uh, whoa

Baby don’t be mean, I mean it with my heart
If you don’t like the game
I might be torn apart
Get real and start, I’m runnin to my phone
Until I fall in love
Until I win your heart

This game is like a gamble
It's my heart you handle
Need you to be gentle
You should let me win
Not your heart I’m playing
Don't know what to say
I'm tryina catch a break
Boy you should let me win, oh, oh, oh
You should let me win, oh, oh, oh",Let Me Win
Chrisette Michele,"Here I go with my heart wide open
I’m all frustrated again
Yeah lock the door, throw away the key
Said I’ll never let no one in
I was gullible
I was wrapped up in the web you caught me in
So vulnerable
True love lost its meaning

And after self-evaluation
I found I lost me in translation
See the girl with the broken heart
See the girl with the ugly scars
It’s not a girl with the brand new scarf, oh yeah

Now I know how to love somebody
I know love is out there for me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Love won’t leave me out
I know how to love somebody
I know love will come back to me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Love won’t leave me out

It’s amazing to know how far
You could go on hope with no doubt
It’s the way love goes
It’ll take you through and it always brings you out
It won’t leave you stranded
Though you may feel abandoned
My experience is my evidence

And with a little evaluation
I found I got a whole lot of patience
Am I the girl with the broken heart?
And the girl with the ugly scars
It’s not a girl with the brand new scarf

Now I know how to love somebody
I know love is out there for me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Love won’t leave me out
I know how to love somebody
I know love will come back to me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Love won’t leave me out

I can feel my heart again
This time I’m not afraid
I can open up my ear
Hear what true love’s got to say
This time I want it all
No matter run or fall
I won’t back at all when love goes

Now I know how to love somebody
I know love is out there for me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Now I know how to love somebody
I know love will come back to me
I know there’s no way that love forgot
Love won’t leave me out

No, no, no
It’s not gonna leave me out no, no
I’ve come too far
I’ve come so far for love to leave me out like this, oh yea
Oh it didn’t forget about me
Love won’t leave me out",Love Won't Leave Me Out
Chrisette Michele,"Hey! Williamsburg Brooklyn, stand up
I see you, red lipstick
Uh huh skinny jeans and it's beanie season
Coffee cups, bottom's up
Let's change the world people, hands in the air
Leggo, that's what they say in Paris

Spend a lot of money at the tattoo shop on weekends
Spend a lot of dividends on indie concert tickets
And I might just fly to Amsterdam
To hang with a friend of mine
Ray-ban shades hide the party
I had at my spot last night
At 4:30 make it to Grace Jones day I feel so fly
Oho, a coffee run I'm so tired
Starbucks please I'm so wired
Tryina change the world, aye

I'm a rich hipster
I hang with thirty thousandaires, yeah
A really, really rich hipster
The richness lives in here

What you go on? (Uniform, yet not the norm)
(Homemade T-shirt, tattoos, Converse, uniform)
You look nice (Yet not the norm)

We all try to be different but we're all alike
Sharing art and love we all bleed red tonight
When I hit the club, promise to show me love
No matter who you are, y'all can get along
Meet a new stranger, make a new friend
Never know maybe a friend to the end
American to London and back again
Wave your love when you wave your flag
That's right, I said wave your love
When you wave your flag, be rich

I'm a rich hipster
I hang with thirty thousandaires, yeah
I'm a rich hipster, my richness lives in here

She so ahead of the curb
PETA get on her nerves
A thrift store for furs
And I’m hoping that miss knows her worth
my loafer she deserve of this that's and mores
Williamsburg with the riff raff of course
Bills gonna fall behind
For the ills and the fashion forward
OK, OK smile for the photo
Cafe Havana tryna find a couple Soho's
Approximately, my street, just watch me
The cops do, but cabs don’t I’m dark skin
Chris Dior, Margiela, Givenchy
Cool people in costumes is how I see it
Greene Street, I’m just playing some Nasir
If I ruled the world build a ghetto with non fear
And Complex will cover Obama and Romney
And the only lucrative beef
Is to fucking rely on me

I'm a rich hipster
I hang with thirty thousandaires, come one aha
I'm a rich hipster, my richness lives in here

Chrisette Michele,"I want to be your all but
I have to be a soldier
I want so bad to focus
Throw my feet right from under me
But a change that no one ever once made for me
Not that I'm scared to love you
I'm tryin to protect you

I'm not the one you should be running to
I'm not the one you want to get close to
Tried to be warm,
Something went wrong
Trying to warn you

My temperature's like snow
So cold
Let me melt here
Into your arms like snow

Can't stay outside forever
Not in this type of weather
You should be somewhere nicer
With someone so much kinder
Please, believe me
When I say you should be somewhere
With someone special

Chrisette Michele,"Just because I love you
Doesn’t mean I don’t get mad
It just means I won’t stay mad for long

Sometimes I wanna be alone

Doesn’t mean I'm a robot
I am a human being with feelings

Oh, let me get this straight
You got an attitude
'Cause I don’t wanna do things your way

Sup so so supa
Sup so so supa
Sup so so, sup so so, sup so so supa

Just because I’m your lady
Don’t mean you can’t treat me like a baby
Sometimes rock me to sleep in your arms
You call me a woman
But every now and then
I wanna feel like a little girl
Don’t I make your world better?
Don’t I make you feel better?
Oh baby ain’t my love the best you ever had?
So why you gotta do me like that that

It's ironic coming first place
I'm still the plug, champagne, making love
On a beach waking up, all your friends says luck
I just really think it's us, and we're never breaking up
Oh, that [?] cold game, but I see swan
Let it shine to the least born
Had to take you shopping at the each mall
So I told her how to move, no forever 21

Took off your clothers, held a pose
Drawing youour arms, your hands and vens and fingers and your lips
Broken nose
On your eyes, so just stare into the distance

Christ's Hospital Choir,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.","O Little Town of Bethlehem, carol (arr. from English traditional, ""Fore"
Christa Dulude,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love
Christa Dulude,"No regrets altho' our love affair has gone astray
No regrets I know I'll always care though you're away
Somehow our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine

No regrets sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger when the other love forgets 
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine",No Regrets

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Christa Grix,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Deprived of the love of a father

You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I've never done
It's been one hill after another
And I've climbed them all one by one

Oh but this time Lord you gave me a mountain,
A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife

She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Say it again 
There's got to be a better way-yeah 
What is it good for? (war)

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me
War, it ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War, friend only to the undertaker, war

No more castles in the sky
No more building on rocks
Do you hear the whispers flowing by?
Almost feel like angels in the sky
Talking about angels: last night 
I felt an angel by my side
And when he spoke?
He told me I would be the one for you
I knew that was the truth ?cause 
An angel never lies ? angels never lie

Ah ha aha aha (aha ha)
Ah ha aha aha ? aha aha

Chorus:

I?ll fly away with you today
I?ll fly away with you today
Take my hand lets be bold and find eternity 2x

Verse Two:

The preacher came and we signed our love
And they know we are meant to be (oh oh eah yeah)
They say our eyes speaks a love so true
And I see it too; oh I feel it strong (oh oh eah, yeah)
I know I can trust this heart of mine
I see true love in your eyes
Thanks to you I know the true meaning of love

You made me believe that there's nothing in this world I can't be

Be the second that you touch your lips to mine

And broken melody of love and life

Fill the heart with the joy once we knew

The burns on my feet,
White and unsoiled sheets

He reached for all desire, kept his hands far from me
How my mind built high could rectify such pain and deceit
How the sorrow plunged, concrete and ashen weeps
The porous bed it reeks with unresolved peeks

Touch the beating, heart of my heart

Soul of my soul, do you feel me?
Touch the beating, heart of my heart

Footsteps tied 'till believing

And he cracks, now we are safer

(Still) bite through, break the ice
(Still) soon words will be forgotten
(Still) though, cruel scenes linger on

We hide from cold still-lives on empty floors
We hide our bent husbands behind slamming doors

Walking on water in a sea of incest

embedded on my chest
I can't leave home without my
bullet proof vest

fighting with scorpions tied around my neck

on slaughter avenue

Time is digging graves for the chosen few
Children dig graves for me and you

start your two day life
on a two day vacation
I've got a spiritual cramp going for my ribs
Those gangsters toting guns
are shooting spikes through my wrist
children using their fingers instead of words
Fingers bury children under the boards
I can die a thousand times
But I will always be here
with the power skull secrets
of forgotten years

with bloodstains of tears
my hands are the killer that confirms
my tears

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

And she was lovin' on his rough neck
and she was talking about running away
And he was puffin' on a cigarette

and you don't need to mess with

Then he said, ain't you been listening?

And it'll only break your heart
If you don't

I ain't nothin' but a drifter
You could do a lot better
Then leaned over and he kissed her
He said you got another year of college
And a good momma and a daddy
And me, I got $93 in this old '82 Chevy

So let me go
You don't need me baby
Stop holding on the way you are
Don't you know I'm no good for you
And it'll only break your heart
If you don't

But you can't hide behind those shades there on your face
Ya see I don't think you're all that tough
I just think you're scared of love
And I think I won't take up that much space

(So)Let me go
Take me with you baby
It's so cold outside your arms/I belong where you are (DEPENDING ON SONG VERSION)

Christian Kane,"Mmm Well our love story reads like a book of lies-
Good intentions, better alibis
No happy endings, no straight lines, no movin' on,
But no goodbyes.
This bittersweet revelry will be the death of me.

We go round and round, tryin' to work it out
And all I get is hell bent and bound
Never far from right where we are.
And you'd think we'd get enough
And know we're gonna fuck it up,
We're holdin' on, sinkin' down,
Here we go around and around
Making circles
Making circles

We both need to lead while we dance along
One more graceful spin on who's right or wrong
The same old words, the same old song
Baby, we're right where we belong.
And it can't get much better and it sure can't get worse
Well either way you turn, it's gonna hurt.

We go round and round, trying to work it out
And all I get is hell bent and bound
Never far from right where we are.
And you'd think that we would get enough
And know we're gonna fuck it up,
We're holding on, sinking down,
Here we go around and around
Making circles
Making circles

You'd think we'd had enough
Be sick and tired of fuckin' up,
Holdin' on, sinkin' down
Here we go around and around.",Making Circles
Christian Kane,"I was down in Whiskey River
Stopped in for a drink
Minding my own business
Trying not to think
Bartender came over with a shot of his best
Said this ones from the lady in the long black dress
She came waltzing 'round the corner
Anybody sitting here
Started taking off her glasses and letting down her hair
I said thank you for the drink ma'am
How'd you know my brand?
She said there's certain things a woman can tell about a man
I said

[Chorus]
Do you like the hard kick of old Kentucky Bourbon?
Or the slow burn of Tennessee rye
Just when I thought I lost her
Pathetic conversation
She said slide over and kiss me
I got more than whiskey in mind

Oh man my heart was jump
Shaking on the stool
I moved a little closer
And I tried to play it cool
The band started rockin'
It was kinda hard to hear
I order us a double
And chased it with a beer
How

[Chorus]

Ooh
I started getting dizzy from the liquor on her lips
No eighty proof has ever got me buzzing like this
I love the
Man I love the
Hard kick of old Kentucky bourbon
And the slow burn of Tennessee rye
At this point in the night no need for conversation
I got more than whiskey
Slide over and kiss me
I got more than whiskey in mind
Yeah",Whiskey in Mind
Christian Kane,"Had a rag-top Cadillac 
Rode it on Sunset Boulevard 
And I had a hold on a centerfold 
And a Tony Montana cigar 
I had the top down, rock 'n roll sound, and palms blowin' in the breeze

I'm callin' all country women 
I've sure missed you all since I've been gone 
Yeah well I'm callin' all country women, yeah 
Well them uptown girls, they just ain't down home (down home) 

Yeah I was in New York after midnight down at the Bungalow eight 
Through the supermodels and Cristal bottles she started walkin' my way 
She had a gin and tonic and Manalo Blahniks and that Dolce and Gabana suit 
I said, ""Damn, you're fine, but have you ever tried jeans and cowboy boots?""

Christian Kane,"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout boy
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs

I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

I remember we were driving driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

Christian Kane,"So he's gone and left you all alone?
You think the better of your years
Were spent with him.
The little girl who used to dance
On fire and brimstone
Is all but dead.
Where's the girl I knew that held

A lighter up to the radio,
She'd do anything she wants
Because she can?
We were seventeen and wild
And we were jumpin' on the Devil's bed
I didn't raise you like that.

I taught you lessons about freedom
Strapped to the bucket of a 455.
I lit your hair on fire
Racing ten mile flats
Where American heavy metal cries.
Oh we were waitin' and wishin'
On pink slips and kisses at the end of the line.
When you rat-a-tat tatted on the glass
And you screamed on high,
I'm alive.

You can say that cat is long gone
I bet you look real hard
You can find that girl within
She's probably waitin' in the wings
For you to come along.
To let her out again
You need a quarter mile, a bunch of horses,
And some gasoline.

Got a zero in the bank
On my account
It's been a week since she's been home
That's seven days of on my own
That's my number baby,
Gonna lay my money down

My destination is dependin' on the right turn
The right field of dreams
Well I'm rollin'down the highway
Passin' on the hallway
Burnin' gasoline...

I'm seein' signs up ahead in lights
Vegas city limit lines
Tonight I'm gonna let it ride away
Well I'm puttin' down everything I own
On the mercy of these bones
Come on man, God bless these seven days!

Yeah well I sold my Chevy for a couple hundred bucks
I'm bettin' it all
And I'm countin' on Lady Luck,
Me and destiny have made a deal,
You can't shake these nerves of steel
So come on, fate, let's see where we end up

My temptation's already left me with a hand,
I can't even see
But I'm gonna play 'em, I'm gonna hold 'em

Christian Kane,"Faded dreams and blue jeans
A Rangers cap with sweat rings
There's a hole in the sole of my favorite boots
Well I've been at it a long time
Working on that bottom line
And every shirt I've worn,
The collar's been blue.

One of these days I'm gonna jump right off that shelf
And hit the ground runnin'
At least that's what I keep telling myself.

[Chorus: x3]
I've been sittin' on the fence for way too long
Warming that bench as chance moves on
And believe me, that ain't no way to live.
And this barely gettin' by is really gettin' old
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
But someday something's gotta give.

Busted hands and broken land
And black gold turned to sand
And the whiskey's the only well that's running deep
Yeah the dust devils dancin' on the mesa again
At the mercy of that west Texas wind
And the tumbleweeds, they seem to know more than me.

Oh they always find their way right out of town
They never turn back,
They keep on rolling and they don't slow down.

Must come to some kinda of ending
We were so damn good, I guess we never stood a chance

When a new moon shines through your window
Or you hear a sad song on the radio
Then you don't know why you but just start to cry
Or your driving round on a sunny day
And outta nowhere comes the pouring rain
Then a memory hits you right out of the blue
That's just me
Thinking of you

I'm not gonna try to stop you
Don't mean that I don't want too
If I know you, you've already made up your mind
To go on and go with your re-believing
But a million miles between us
But you still feel me like I'm right there at your side

Then you don't know why but you just start to cry
Or your driving round on a sunny day
And outta nowhere comes the pouring rain
Then a memory hits you right out of the blue
That's just me
Thinking of you

And I'm thinkin' about the road your on
I'm thinkin' about you coming home
I'm wondering if you got your radio on

And feelin' hits you right out of the blue

Christian Kjellvander,"A recurring vision of her out on the lawn
The early haze of the seventies sun kept the fevers gone
Curious, placid, green
Now she's a well faring maiden, a brunette of the dream
But those where the days, so much like today
And that was the difference indifference makes

Allelujah.
Summers past all feel as one but dismaled by a move
For reasons I did not understand, but for a new school
And if ever you have fought to hold tears infesting eyes
As you realize a friend is not
But those where the days, so much like today
You say drugs and woman but game is still game

Allelujah.
The old house repainted now but still stuck on that street
Children melt in topaz light of faded memory
No matter how it ends cherish these moments
Of solace found in friends
For these are your days continue your play
For you know not the next time you will meet
Someone who knows you best to date and who loves you all the same

Allelujah.",Allelujah
Christian Kjellvander,"Damned but flowing by the shiver
Up the spine and down the river
And I hope I can wither
And return in the wake of winter
Built to keep when all is calm
But to plague when wayward is longed
And I hope I can forgive him
And I hope they can forgive me
So long so long so long
Since we where young
So long so long so long

Where friendship's found friendship is often lost
With valiant wishes of becoming ends

To be where my water meets my stones
I'm going home, going home

So many thoughts should not have left your bed

Almost where ocean meets the sky

But the road looks prettier tonight

That's where my cross lay pathed with catalyst madamsÂ´
Amidst lulu and bird cherry
She reminded me of people I have known
But friends turn out so differently

Only but one score ago we ran across the floor
Screaming â??we want to be older!â??
So harnessed her, oh to be floating there
A wisdom that somebody told her

Relocation just to figure if I am
Because of or despite
If only these wires could echoe once again
There's more to hear than meets the eye

Only one stones throw away is were we used to play
when somebody stole her
And now we are here only five miles from there
And she falls asleep on my shoulder

Then the rain came rolling in
She said where she'd been oh where she's been",Words in the Wires

There in your silent night
joy of a song's delight

I ain't going to hand around, I'm going home
I'm going home, going home

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game
But using people just ain't my thing
And I don't dangle from any string
To please some fool that don't care about
They turned me inside out, I'm going home

Con gusto escuchare

Supo llenarte mas que yo

Claro que se perder

Y sin embargo esperaba
Que te quedaras pero

Mientras yo me tragaba palabras
Que no pude decir
Y si el viento hoy sopla a tu favor
Yo no te guardare rencor

Y tu asiendo el café llenas de alegría toda la casa hoy

And then we strolled that golden sand

And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by

Beneath the blue

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to

And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days

To nights that never end?

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

Dear, when in your arms I creep,

Schon so lange in mein Leben
Immer wenn ich von dir träume und mir deine Liebe fehlt
Ich bin so tief getroffen und steh am Rand der Welt
Wenn Nachts der rote Regen fällt
Der rote Regen fällt

Ich hab geträumt mit dir von einem Haus am Meer
Davon träumst du jetzt bestimmt mit ihr, das Leben ist nicht fair
Ich sah schweigend zu wie über mir die Sonne unterging
Wie ich dich verlor als du sie trafst und dein Herz Feuer fing

Und jetzt fällt der rote Regen
Schon so lange in mein Leben
Immer wenn ich von dir träume und mir deine Liebe fehlt
Ich bin so tief getroffen und steh am Rand der Welt
Wenn Nachts der rote Regen fällt

Wird die Sonne nie mehr scheinen
Wird der Himmel dunkel bleiben
Muss ich weiter von dir träumen, weil mir deine Liebe fehlt
Ich bin so tief getroffen und steh am Rand der Welt
Wenn Nachts der rote Regen fällt
Der rote Regen fällt",Roter Regen
Christin Stark,"Bist du noch zu retten? 
Sage ich zu mir das ich die Kontrolle über mich schon wieder verlier', bei dir 
Worauf um Himmels Willen lass ich mich hier ein 
In welches Abenteuer flieg ich jetzt mit dir wieder rein? 
Doch es muss sein 
Widerstand ist zwecklos 
Sinnlos mich zu wehren
Die Sprache der Vernunft will mein Herz nicht hören
Was mit dir hier abgeht ist von einem anderen Stern

Sieber Himmel oder Hölle
Was geschieht hier mit uns zwei´n
Ist der Wahnsinn noch zu bremsen?-Meine Antwort lautet nein!
Siebter Himmel oder Hölle
Sind wir beide in Gefahr?
Die Gefühle hart am Limit-Meine Antwort lautet JA!
Siebter Himmel
Siebter Himmel
Die Gefühle hart am Limit-Meine Antwort lautet JA!

Das hier mit uns beiden hat mich überrollt
Ist kaum zu ertragen doch genau so hab ich´s gewollt 
Zehn-Millionen Volt
Kann nicht mehr entkommen was immer ich auch tu
Retten und erlösen kannst mich nur noch du
Denn den Gurt vom Schleudersitz krieg ich schon längst nicht mehr zu

Siebter Himmel oder Hölle
Sind wir beide in Gefahr?
Die Gefühle hart am Limit-Meine Antwort lautet JA!

Lass dich mit mir fallen jetzt wird geliebt
Bis die ganze Welt sich rückwärts dreht
Alles ist erlaubt-alles kann passier´n heute Nacht mit dir

Christina,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Christina Aguilera,"I am done, smoking gun
We've lost it all, the love is gone
She has won, now it's no fun
We've lost it all, the love is gone

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me

And we tried, oh how we cried
We lost ourselves, the love has died
And though we tried you can't deny
We're left as shells, we lost the fight

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me

Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet
But you chose lust when you deceived me
And you'll regret it, but it's too late
How can I ever trust you again?

Christina Aguilera,"When I think  how life used to be, Always walking in the shadows.
Then I look  at what you've given me, I feel like dancing on my tip toes.

I must say everyday I pray
When realize you're by my side,
I know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

There are times  that I test your faith, 'til you think you might surrender.
Baby I'm, I'm not ashamed to say, that my hopes will grow in splendor

You walked by in the nick of time
looking like an answered prayer
You know I'm truly

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
Blessed to make sure you never go.

Blessed with love and understanding,
Blessed when I hear you call my name,
Do my best with faith that's never-ending,
Blessed to make sure you feel the same.

Deep inside you fill me with your tender touch

Blessed for everything you've given me,
Blessed for all the tenderness you show,
Do my best with every breath that's in me,
To see you never go",Blessed

Cause your love inspires me. And when I need a friend you're always on my side,

I'll be the rain in your summer
The chill in your fall

A love for all time
I'll be the fire in your winter
The sun in your spring

Through the storm
I'll guide you
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky

Making you wait for my love
Never lie love

I'll read your each and every feeling
When you need me to
So now I gotta let you know

Baby you don't have to dream
Cause what I've got inside for you

Long as we can stand together

Gonna make a new tomorrow 
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow 
Better listen when I say 
Love will find a way

doesn't last forever 
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams 
After all is said and done 
We're still here together 
Never listen to the lies and jealousy

Christina Aguilera,"Can you hear it in my voice
Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know
Isn't it obvious?

I'm the one who's in control
Now I'm acting like a fool
Do my feelings show?
Is my face aglow?
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Do you see my hands  they tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes
Every glance, every smile
Must give me away
And I feel so much I can't hide

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?",Obvious
Christina Aguilera,"It's either black or white that's right
We're making love or in a fight
Sometimes you make me so blue

But then it feels so good  I knew it would
You know the way to make me crazy
I want to give it to you

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

You take me high and low  you know
I'm never sure which way you're gonna go
You're such a mystery to me

But baby hot or cold, you got a hold
Of my imagination
I think you know what i mean

You make me feel so emotional
I can't let go I'm so emotional
I'm sinking deep into an ocean full of you
I'm so emotional

Rain is falling down on me
Suddenly the sun comes out
Sometimes north or south of love
But never out.",So Emotional

Hand in hand they pass me by 
Wish I was one of them 
Wish I had somebody

I want someone that I can hold 

Want someone wanting me 
want to feel how it feels to be

Somebody's somebody 
Somebody's someone 
Some sweet lover's lover 
I want to be that one 
Someone faithful to someone faithful 
Someone kind to someone kind to me 
Somebody to somebody who loves me 
Who loves me 

Spending all of my time 
Spending all my time on me 
Where is that someone who 
I can give my time to 

Searching for that lover 
With the love that will change my life 
I want two arms to hold me close 
I want the thing I need most 

Somebody needing me 
So I can feel how it feels to be

Is someone to love me more

And I've never seen most of the world
I don't know diving out of the sky
Or living like diamonds and pearls

See I haven't danced to a musical tune
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom
I haven't smiled when alone in my room very much
Then we touched

I just know when you put your hands on me
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold
I just know when you put your hands on me
I feel ready and I lose my self control

I don't know if a doll can unwind
Or how to make a person go
I don't know how to be what you like
And simply open up the depths of my soul

So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down
Ready for nothing but holding my ground
I haven't used a particular noun very much

I feel sexy and my body turns to gold
I just know when you put your hands on me

That's how you know it's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willin' to give me more than

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me, yeah, yeah

A girl needs somebody sensitive but tough
Somebody there when the goin' gets rough
Every night he'll be giving his love to just one girl
Somebody cool but real tender too
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for doin' exactly

What a girl wants
What a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for being there for me, yeah, yeah

Christina Aguilera,"Hay, en mi corazon una inquietud
Hoy te veo tan distante
Hay, algo que me aleja de tu amor
De repente tu cambiaste
Hoy insegura estoy
El estar sin ti, se que me hara sufrir

Anoche yo senti que me besaste diferente
Y me quede sin saber que hacer
Yo te conozco y se que algo no anda bien
Ven, dime la verdad, no quiero imaginar
Que fue el beso del final

No se por que ha cambiado tu atitud
Ojala que todo sea un error
No quiero comprobar que te perdi
Ni que nuestro amor se acabe
Oigo una voz que se hunde en mi
Que me vuelve a repetir
Lo que no quiero oir

Verse:
The world seems so cold,
when i face so much all alone.
A little scared to move on
and knowing how fast I have grown.
And i wander just where i fit in
oh the visions alive in my head

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain i will find my way
i will keep on traveling this road
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

verse 2:
i can't lt go now,
even when darkness surrounds.
but if i hold on, yer, i will show the world
all the things that you never expected to see from little old me,this pittsburgh girl.
and i wander just where my place is,
close my eyes and i remind my self this. oh yer

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain i will find my way
i will keep on traveling this road
'till i finally reach my dream till I'm living and I'm breathing my destiny

It comforts me, it keeps me
alive each day of my life.
Always guiding me, providing me
with the hope i desperateley need.
Well i gotta believe there's something out there meant for me.
o i get on my knees, praying i will receive,
the courage to grow and the faith to love.

i will be strong on my own
i will see through the rain, i will find my way

Christina Aguilera,"Don't look at me

Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone
Left the puzzle undone
Ain't that the way it is

You're beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
Oh no
You're beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring you down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do (no matter what we do)
No matter what we say (no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes

And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always, shine)
And tomorrow we might awake
On the other side

We're beautiful
No matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down
Oh no

Christina Aguilera,"So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard
So what do we do girls, shout out loud
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore
But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back

You're just a little boy
Think you so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk big to make up for smaller things

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth

As I'm driving
I'm captured by the view
So much beauty
The road becomes my muse
The heat is rising
And my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected
Is the child that lies within

Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me

You won't stop me

All this tension telling me just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us being some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I want to do right now is have your contact on me

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man
Understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you call, it ain't my fault
It can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact that
What we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin', hittin'
Underneath the sheets

Can you put your hands my waistline
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a please don't disturb sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine

Now listen
So, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty
All night a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right
Work me like a 9 to 5

We have a physical thing
We'll make love, but don't fall in love
Let me get mine, you get yours
You spend time
Just enough so you get yours, and I get mine

Christina Aguilera,"Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

It's not so easy to forget
All the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And every day I'm afraid to come home
In fear of what I might see there

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday

And I'm OK
I'm OK",I'm OK

It's impossible to love you
If you don't, let me know, what you're feeling

I just, I want to make it right
'Cause boy I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind

'Cause it's impossible
Oh, baby it's impossible
For me to love you, this way
It's impossible
Oh baby it's impossible

If you're always trying to make it so damn hard

If you're always, always putting up your guard
This is not a circus
Don't ya play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on going up and down

Hey, oh oh, hey

He comes from a foreign place
An island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Til' I'm breathless, I'm helpless
Can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance, to the rhythm of the band
I feel his finger tips, grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a rare bliss

Mama used to warn me
To beware of those Latin lovers
She said I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother
I said hey mama, you seem to forget
I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over
But I realized
Big brown eyes can hypnotize
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
(Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah)
It's pure infatuation

Hey

Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within
Feels so good it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started
I'm giving in
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me
Finds the words when I can not speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles (when he smiles)
I feel like a little child
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers te quiero, te quiero

Caught between my mama's words
And what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world
But a part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight
Ooh, hey

You adore me, never be lonely, oh

I am full blood boricua (boricua)

Christina Aguilera,"Oh, yeah, oh huh
I woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Nobody's gonna bring me down today
Been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
So I decided right here and now that my outlook's gotta change

That's why I'm gonna
Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried
For every time somebody hurt my pride
Feeling like they won't let me live life
Take the time to look at what is mine

I see every lesson completely
I thank God for what I got from above
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
Keep on singing my song

I never want to dwell on my pain again
There's no use in reliving how I hurt back then
Remembering all of the hell I felt when I was running out of faith
Every step I vowed to take was towards a better day

'Cause I'm about to
Say goodbye to every single lie
All the fears I've held too long inside
Every time I felt I could try
All the negativity I had inside

For too long I've been struggling. I couldn't go on
But now I've found I'm feeling strong and moving on
I believe they can take anything from me
But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace
They can say all they want to say about me

But I'm gonna carry on
I'm gonna keep on singing my song

Whoa, and every time I tried to be what they wanted from me
It never came naturally
So I ended up in misery, wasn't able to see
All the good around me
They wasted so much energy on what they thought of me
Simply just remembering to breathe

I'm human, I ain't able to please
Everyone at the same time, so now I find
My peace of mind living one day at a time

I'm human and I answer to one god
It comes down to one love
Until I get to heave above I've made the decision
Never to give up
Til the I day I die no matter what I'm gonna carry on & keep on singing my song

(They can't take anything from me)
I believe that they can do what they wanna
Say what they want to say

(They can say what they wanna)
But I'm gonna keep on
(Keep on )
I believe it
That they can take from me
But they can't take my inner peace

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Say what you want to say, but I'm gonna sing my song
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah",Keep on Singin' My Song

Christina Aguilera,"People ask if I'm in love with you
Because I'm sitting here with your picture
And smiling to myself
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say yes

What a feeling of vulnerability coming over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free
Free, make me be me
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

People ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by saying
You got my heart by just being who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter about the money I make
Or what I do, or that I'm a, huh, a star

Unconditionally you're there for me
Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, is incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel, so sweet
Makes me want to say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, believe me
Like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me for me
Is that you're loving me for me

Its so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny
Oh, heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet
This isn't ordinary, he's loving me for me

Stripped of all make up, no need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve, every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely, taking all of me in
He's real,he's honest, he's loving me for me

I try to hide can't make it alright, it's overkill
Now I'm ready to fight
(ready to fight)
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over
I just want to live simple and free

I just want to get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day

Feeling confined like I'm bin' force fed
My visions blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overloaded and I'm outta control
(outta control)
So sick and tired of bein' so misused
(so misused)
You're taking me down with all your mental abuse
And I said, I gotta get you outta my head
Everybody's always trying to look me over
I just want to live simple and free

I just want to get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

Leaving the house around quarter to five
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high, and I feel so alice
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin
Crossin' the border where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over
(Don't make me over)
I just want to live simple and free

I just want to get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

I just want to get away
Saving all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me

You want to break me down [Repeat: x3]",Make Over
Christina Aguilera,"Yo te contaré, una historia
De como, un puertoriqueño me robó el corazón
Nunca más he vuelto a amar de esa manera
Quizás jamás lo haré
Es la historia de mi primer amor
Era buen mozo con grandes why profundos ojos marrones
Un bailarí­n
Juntos nos perdimos en el ritmo del amor
Así­ es como comenzó
",Primer Amor [Interlude]
Christina Aguilera,"When they push when they pull
Tell me you can hold on
When they say you should change
Can you lift your head high,
And stay strong
Will you give up, give in,
When your hearts crying out,
That it's wrong
Will you love you for you
At the end of it all

In life there's going to be times
When you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurity
Seems to take control
We start to look outside ourselves
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgettin' that
The one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
Its in your hands
The world is your
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

The boy who wonders
Is he good enough for them
Keeps tryin' to please em' all
But he just never seems to fit in
Then there's the girl who thinks
She'll never be good enough for him
Keeps tryin' to change
And that's a game she'll never win

Now In life there's going to be times
When you're feeling low
And in your mind insecurity
Seems to take control
We start to look outside ourselves
For acceptance and approval
We keep forgettin' that
The one thing we should know is

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
Its in your hands
The world is your
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

In the mirror
Is where she come face to face
With her fears
Her reflection-so foreign to her
After all these years
All of her life she has tried to be something
Besides herself
Now time has passed
And she's ended up someone else with regret

What is it in us that makes us feel the need
To keep pretending
Gotta let ourselves be

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
Its in your hands
The world is your
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for
Spread your wings and soar

Don't be scared to fly alone
Find a path that is your own
Love will open every door
Its in your hands
The world is your
Don't hold back and always know
All the answers will unfold
What are you waiting for

Christina Aguilera,"I remember when it all first began
We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)

I played hard to get but I couldn't help
I gave up my ironing
You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship

What happened to those days when
You used to be compassionate
Caring what I thought and said
So attentive gentleman
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set
Taking me for granted lately
Frankly, it's gotta quit

I feel under appreciated
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say
I'm feeling underappreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Back to the beginning, to the very beginning
When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do

I was feeling high on love tonight
Thought I never come back down
Now it seems that you and me
Have lost our solid ground

Half the time I realize
I seem to give more than I get
Funny how things seem to change
After a few years commitment

Used to talk for hours on end
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed
How I missed those days when you stayed awake
Now you roll over and snore instead

I feel under appreciated
Now girls help me out 
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say
I'm feeling under appreciated
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I miss those nice massages
The long for closeness
The way you talk
How it turned me on
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips

I needed those days back

I feel under appreciated
Now girls help me out

I'm feeling under appreciated

Christina Aguilera,"Young girl, don't cry
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
Ooh
Young girl, it's alright
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh

When you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within, oh

Young girl, don't hide
You'll never change if you just run away
Ooh, whoa yeah
Young girl, just hold tight
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, ooh

Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
When you look outside, look inside to your soul

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
If you will learn to begin to trust the voice within

Oh, ho, yea
Ooh, oh, yea (Ooh, ooh, ooh) oh, yea
Life is a journey (Ooh, ooh,ooh)
It can take you anywhere you choose to go (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
As long as you're learning (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll find all you'll ever need to know (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Be strong)
Break it (Hold on)
You'll make it (Be strong)
Just don't forsake it because (Hold on)
(No one can tell you what you can't do)
No one can stop you, you know that I'm talking to you

When there's no one else, look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend, just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength that will guide your way
You'll learn to begin to trust the voice within

Christina Aguilera,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Every time I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
Let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I

Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back

I say
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya

Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras

Put your fingers up in the air if your high

Waste Nigga's like toxic, wet like galoshes 
Can I handle my biz? Yes you can 
I 'cause chaos and bring a lot of def to jams 
Yes I can, now ask to get out 
Pop the trunk, clu-clunk and now give me a ba-bump ba-bump

Y'all faggot's stepped on my Huffman and Coo's 
Word to Dan, tan, pillow and cool be

To get inside the minds
Of every legend I've ever wanted to stand beside
It's like an endless ride
Feeling the lows and highs
Of every lyric and melody
Every single rhyme
So here I stand today
In tribute I do pay
To those before me who laid it down and paved the way
And so to God I pray that he will give me strength
To carry forward the gift of song in his good faith
In his good faith

I'm going back to basics
To where it all began
I'm ready now to face it
I wanna understand
What made the soul singers
And the blues figures
That inspired a higher generation
The jazz makers, and the ground breakers
They gave so much of themselves and dedication

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then, suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again

So, mother, I thank you
For all you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over
'You deserve much more than this.'

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life; she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (He'll never hurt us again)

Burying hurt and regret
But, mama, he'll never touch us again

Christina Aguilera,"So many years have gone by
Always strong, tried not to cry
Never felt like I needed any man
To comfort me in life
But I'm all made up today
A veil upon my face
But no father stands beside me
To give this bride away

Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Wearing my white dress
I have waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Here I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
I've finally found the right man

Thoughts racing fast through my mind
As I'm gazing down the aisle
That my future will mend the memories
Torn between father and child

My emotions overload
'Cause there is no hand to hold
There's no shoulder here to lean on
I'm walking all on my own

Here I go

Now I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking that chance
You've shown me there's a right man
'Cause I never knew the right man

Well, I'm standing in the chapel
Ready to confess
That I've waited for this moment
With tears of happiness
Now I leave behind my past
By taking the chance
Whoa

Well, I'm standing at four corners
To have and to hold
Now, my love, you stand beside me
To walk life's winding road
And I owe it all to you
For taking the chance

And one day, my little girl
Will reach out her hand
She'll know I found the right man",The Right Man

It gets so complicated
All the things you've gotta be
Everything's changin'

Everything I put you through

When I'm about to fall
Somehow you're always waitin'
With your open arms to catch me
You're gonna save me from myself
From myself, yes
You're gonna save me from myself

My love is tainted by your touch
'Cause some guys have shown me aces
But you've got that royal flush
I know it's crazy everyday
Well, tomorrow may be shaky
But you never turn away

Don't ask me why I'm cryin'
'Cause when I start to crumble
You know how to keep me smilin'
You always save me from myself
From myself, myself
You're gonna save me from myself

I know it's hard, it's hard
But you've broken all my walls
You've been my strength, so strong

Oh, oh, oh

If you see me walking down the street
Or in the pages of your magazine
Looking just a little differently
Showing off a softer side of me

They saying I'm looking like a lady
They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everything you see
Gotta let the naughty in me free

There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough
Trying to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later something's gonna erupt us

'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (still got it)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (oh yeah)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me

No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
And if you're still rolling with me, still got it
No matter what you thinking of me, still dirty
Still got that freak in me

Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without being called a million things?

They say I'm not the girl they used to know (used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (oh)
But don't be fooled: the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm letting loose, giving a private show (Don't you know?)

There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to past judgment, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing; so they better beware

'Cause I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (oh)
And if you want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me
I still got that nasty in me

'Cause I'll never play that game (no)
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I ain't never gonna change
And if you're talking about my life
You're only wasting your own time

If I want to wear lingerie outside of my clothes
If I want to be erotic in my own videos
If I want to be provocative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

I still got that nasty in me
Still got that dirty degree (in me)
And if you still want some more sexy
Still got that freak in me

Greatest show on earth
You've never seen before
Here, the fairytale unfolds

What's behind the smoke and glass?
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask
Are you selling them your soul?
Well, you'll be left out in the cold

Is it all blue skies
Fun and games until you fall?
Then you're left without anyone at all
You're riding on a shooting star
With a smile upon your face
But soon the shine fades

And you're left out all alone
Wondering where did they all go?
Oh

Been jaded, hated
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?
Been shut down, pushed out
Made to smile when I wanted to frown

Always working the crowd
Always making new grounds
Always playing the clown

Who'll be staying around

I couldn't breath without you here
What kind of world would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here

How on earth did I do something worth deserving you?

How I cherish through and through every part of you?

Loving you's made me whole; now I belong
I found my home
Promise me we'll always stay

What kind of world would I see without you?

He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again

So, mother, I thank you
For all you've done and still do

Together we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother

It was the day that he turned on his kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Saying over and over and over
'You deserve much more than this.'

She was so sick of believing the lies and trying to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life; she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (all of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back

Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again

I move, you chase, we magnetize
A time I was exploding with no warning sign

[Chorus]
Dynamite
Electrify me all night
Dynamite
Just give it to me, I won't bite
Dynamite
You make me feel, it's alright
Dynamite
Shine it on me

Caught up in this moment I was hypnotized
Shake this feeling got me paralyzed
I do, I don't, I think I might
My body was electric like a flashing light

[Chorus]

A change, a change is coming
A change, a change is coming

All around me that a change is bout to happen
The energy igniting has become my inspiration
If you take a deeper look you'll find the information
I'm only just a figment of controlled imagination

Wishing for this, hoping for all we know
Hearing you breathe, you leave and return
Oh, how we take, how we give we learn

Taking my time, seeing the signs
Letting you guide me home
Watching you grow, letting you know
You are my only

You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me

Tell you my fears, telling you everything
Telling the truth to you gives me wings
Free with my words, free as a bird
I am flying high looking at you

Everything new, you are my life
You bring me hope when I can't breathe
And you give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely

So happy to carry you inside me
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough

Step into the picture that I paint you to my brain game
I let her date you so I give you a migraine
Over and over, put it on me, later you're insane

Once you jump in, we're gonna get up on the lump and hold on
Just let it go, get it up, allow yourself to transform
Follow me, follow me to a place I know of no return

Everything not quite what it seems to be
Slipping and falling through the looking glass
Catching a glimpse at all that lies behind the masks

You disappear with the dawn
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey (prey, prey, prey)
When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed
The birds of prey

Taking the blue pill only made you cry
And all that the red pill did was make you forget why
There is no right, there's no wrong
You only see what you want

When you're out with the birds of prey

They watch and they feed
They take what they need
They bite as you bleed

'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me

If I was a ruler I'd set you straight
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

A rubber band was an analogy
You can even say it's a metaphor
The tension between you and me
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go

I can take a little bit and make it more
A little bit of hate can make it war
But a lot of love ain't enough
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together

If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer
You could say your piece, you could post it on a paper
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler

Your love is pulling like a rubber band
Your love is pulling like a rubber band

Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love
Elastic love, everlastic love
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

Neighbors calling to complain and rain on our parade
They told me to use my head and keep my focus straight
Shame on all of you for being stiff and so straight laced

Just became your worst mistake

So damn wrong
Feel the weight, of your hate
I still bleed, my heart aches
As you take
And You take

Words cut through my skin
Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within
But I'll take it all on
And get up when I fell
Till the last curtain call

But you'll never get the best of me, no more
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more
Aren't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me, no more

So you're cold, made of ice
Heart of stone, born to fight
But I cry
I still cry
Are you happy, you know
I'm unhappy, you know
Take your shot
I'm wide open

Words cut through my skin
Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within
But I'll take it all on

There's no place to hide

Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free
My stage is the greatest in the world
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out

Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede c'e
When shadows fill our day
Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe

Sognamo un mondo senza piu violenza
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace, di fraternita

La forza che ci da
We ask that life be kind
E il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro se
Another soul to love

Nowhere to go 'cause I've been there before
In my mind it is near
I escape all I fear
So by closing my eyes
I am anywhere but here

There's no need for anger
Religion or faith
One glade of grief
Will always remain
It's not on the paper
Or a story book
It's a place to reunite with all that was took
And open my, I open my heart
Seem like a nightingale opened my, opened my hands
When no one else understands

Where life is a eternal and ever green

In your perfect picture
Of the way it should be

So close and so far away
Oh what I'd give for you green jay

taking things in
And spitting them back up
Oh how I understand this
All too well

but id you nested in me
Oh how I'd keep you so safe
From all the ugly creatures

For all I ingest is you this way
Hey something good will come from me

Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter

Christina Crerar,"Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone

That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire

Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go

When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?

Christina Grimmie,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
Somebody that you used to know.

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though

Christina Lux,"Never mind all the things you heard about me
You're never gonna understand it
Every time that I've given you the truth
It's never made a bit of difference

Disappointment takes you
Then the doubt, it breaks you
It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Never mind what you think that you had seen
It all can change in just a moment
Here before you is all the proof you need
Why can't you ever just believe it?",Believe

In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes

All I ever will recall of my life

I couldn't let you see my crying eyes but I wanted so bad to run to you
How could you find someone in just so little time

We said we'd be friends maybe one day, give us one more try
I can't understand, it happened so fast, six months have passed
Now suddenly you've gotten over me

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

I'm trying so hard not to care but you're happy now and it's not fair
Just when I thought that I was getting strong, I see you with her
I was wrong

Now I can pretend that losing you, didn't mean a thing
And I can deny that this whole thing's not happening
To hold it inside, it's killing me, it's hurting me
If you could only see

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together, forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together, forever, it won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends, oh
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

It hurts when, ooh, ooh
It hurts when I see you, I see you with her
It hurts when my broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you

Verse 1

Hey girl I hear your havin' trouble with your boyfriend again
And why do you keep letting him get away with everything
By now you should know that he's not treatin' you the way you deserve
Yeah I could see that he's fine and we all now love makes you blind
If it doesn't really benefit you, you'll be better off alone
Then it wasn't really meant to be, just move on (oohh)

Chorus:
If you wanna give it all you got
You gotta be the one to call the shots
Tell him all the secrets in your heart
From now on
You need to be the one to take control
Even if it means to let him goooo
Let Go

Ya gotta gotta let go
Ya gotta gotta - gotta let it go
Gotta gotta - let go

Verse 2:
I'm not the type of girl to let somebody else run my life
You won't see me cryin' cause I couldn't get along with some guy
I've never been down with anybody that cannot treat me right
'cause I don't need nobody else to make this food up by myself
If it doesn't really benefit you you'll be better off alone
Then it wasn't really meant to be , just move on (oohh)

I love a fast car
and you got a fast ride 
so won't you take me for a spin out on ya' highway
'cause it's raining outside and
I know that a drive might sound a little crazy
but I feel that it's time

So speed it up, slow it down
Put it back, in reverse
My directions, pay attention to my every word
We can bump, we can swerve
But watch out for that curve
On ya' highway

Engines, roaring
Bodies, exploring
Hold on tight we're going all the way (all the way)
we can go 80 miles an hour
90 miles an hour
as long as you're driving then, it's ok
'cause I love it riding on your highway

[VERSE 2:]
Now, let's take it nice and slow and
I'll tell you where to go
I'll whisper to you softly when I see the signs
I look over to see you
and you're checking out the rear view
I'll control the stick you drive between the lines (whoooaa)

Friends is the phrase you used, to describe our relationship,it was the best for you, when the other girls would come around, you would have an out, to do the do, now I found in me, the strength to say the hell with you, and let it be, no more will I be sick and down, or thinking 'bout loving you

I can't deny I miss you (can't deny I do)
And I can't deny I wish you (wish you only knew)
How to treat a girl, who'd give her whole, world up to you, but I understand you now, you'll never appreciate somebody like me.

I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy
But I can't hide this hurt inside

A guy that's gonna change my life
And I tell you one day just wait and see

Feels like I'm trapped in a maze trying to find my way

And not a full moon of gloom that just cried?

We only met one night, yet he's all in my dreams
His thuggish style, his smile, fulfill my fantasy

'cause he has timbs with the fitted on
Can't wait to get it on, he's movin' like he's a Don
Doin' his thing, was shy when he caught my eye
Now, I'd be down to ride, wish I was by his side
Doin' our thing

Fulfill my fantasy, boy, I want you to put your hands on me
'cause you got what I need, look at the sweat all over my body
Tonight you won't forget and you really didn't say nothing yet
So if you like what you see, boy, I want you to put your hands on me

Boy, I've been feelin' you, yes I've been feelin' you, with all the things you do
You got me caught up in a fantasy and I'll do what you want me to do
Whenever you come my way, I wish that you would stay
'cause baby you're so fine, I wish that you were mine

'cause he has timbs with the fitted on
Can't wait to get it on, he's movin' like he's a Don
Doin' his thing, was shy when he caught my eye
Now I'd be down to ride, wish I was by his side
Doin' our thing

Fulfill my fantasy, boy, I want you to put your hands on me
'cause you got what I need, look at the sweat all over my body
Tonight you won't forget and you really didn't say nothing yet
So if you like what you see, boy, I want you to put your hands on me

Fulfill my fantasy, boy, I want you to put your hands on me
'cause you got what I need, look at the sweat all over my body
Tonight you won't forget and you really didn't say nothing yet

[Verse 1:]
You supposed to be that nigga,
You got a dime on ya side,
(So why you foollin? with me ?),
Listen I ain?t bein? reckless
I?m just tryin? to get this record straight,
(Look what ya doin? to me),
You got me contemplatin? thinkin? maybe,
I should come check you out in that suite,
Pop open some yellow bottles undress me like a model,
Then maybe we could wrinkle the sheets,

But then I know she?ll always be the one you,
Take out show around,
But you continue to hold on to me so,
(Why ?),
Would you think that I could settle for less it?s just
One night no I,
Don?t wanna wake up the next mornin? askin?,
(Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I need to know is,
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Verse 2:]
Now the media?s gossipin? pinnin? me in magazines,
Sayin? I was the one,
(No),
Comparin? us to that Brad, Jen and Angelina affair,
Look baby I ain?t the one,
What I?m sayin? is,
I ain?t tryin? to go for that,
(No),
Look I can?t go for that,
(No),
You need find out where your home is at,
And turn the key and range rove it back,

You didn?t want me then so tell me what made,
You changed ya mind
'cause ain?t a thing don?t changed about me,
Tell me (Why ?),
'cause when you say you love me it?s when I?m with
Someone else I can?t help,
You to continue foollin? me,
So tell me (Why ?),

[Chorus:]
So what I?m tryna? say is
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Bridge:]
I?m like
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

I don't want to say I still love you 
It hurts me everyday thinking who you were kissing, not me 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 
I'm going to speak the truth, I ain't gonna lie 
I let you go and for the tears I cry, thought we was going down 
Oh na na na na na na, oh na na na na na na 

Hook 
And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

Sitting up in my room I'm lighting candles 
Candle lit my handle thinking why 
Why did I let this situation get the best of me 
When I gave the best of me 
Its just crazy how in a minute we connect 
I was baby your lady 
Sweet city holding hands was your favorite 
Now I, I ain't got no sad song to sing 
Youse dead wrong to me 
Cuz I was thinking a minute but 
Since we separated I knew you would never find 
Find another chick like me that's why I stay up on your mind 
I know its hard for you to hear but I ain't got the time 
I moved on, I moved on, I don't want you now 

[Chorus]

And I'm gonna tell everybody 
Cuz you cheating (gonna tell everybody) 
That you mistreat me (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't leave me (gonna tell everybody) 
So you're leaving (gonna tell everybody) 
I don't need it (gonna tell everybody) 
Don't believe it (gonna tell everybody) 
You deceived me (gonna tell everybody) 

I ain't tripping I'm just saying look at what your missing out on now 
Yeah its going all out now, I'm going all out now 
And I ain't going to cry 
Grab my keys to that Bentley GT, call my girlfriends and ride 
You ain't got nothing on me (Christina's going out to party) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me 
Really this thing ain't nothing 
You ain't got nothing on me (run and go and tell everybody) 
You ain't got nothing on me 
You ain't got nothing on me 
Really this thing ain't nothing

When your ass got laid off work, I was there for ya
I should've listened to my ladies, when they told me
""Girl, he ain't nothing but a""

You ain't nothing but, a busta
Still I find it so hard to believe, that I touched ya
You should've spent more time doing me, but I loved ya

Actin' portrayin' be something you wanted to be ya whole life, but please

Look there goes another ho, seen her in a video

Cause I know if I'm falling, you won't let me hit the ground
If the boat is sinking, I know you won't let me drown

This is the only place for me

Nothing could come between us

If I'm holding you, you, you, you, you
And if it all end's; everybody in the world is gone
I'll be standing with you, baby
And if it's the last breath I take
I'll leave my kiss my with you
If there's a wall between us, baby
I know I'll break through

And I'm still on the mend

Nothing's coming easy
And all at once
I feel a little queasy
Oh but if you lost my remedy
Won't you please come and be with me

It's not like there's much better
But his grasp is as green as mine
I can't say that I'm satisfied
Three thousand miles from your kiss goodbye

I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from change
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from breaking
That chances are you're breaking open

Don't come following your fantasy,

Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

Too afraid, to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night
For the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me till I fall asleep

I'm a ghost of a girl
That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me
And the lonely

Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again",The Lonely
Christina Perri,"I'm scared today
More than I told you I was yesterday
Give me a moment to catch my breath
And hold me every second left

Proud of me
That's the only way I want you to be
Look at me and love
What you see

I won't make it alone
I need something to hold

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Don't count the miles,
Count the ""I love you's""

We made it out
And all the other people are asking how
This doesn't even sound like truth
To grow from a bruise

But one day we will realize
How hard it was, how hard we tried
And how our hearts made it out alive

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Don't count the miles,
Count the ""I love you's""

And these are words
I wish you said
But that's not how it went
'Cause you gave up on us in the end

And I won't make it alone
I need something to hold

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised to always come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Kiss me on my shoulder
Tell me it's not over
I promised I'd come home to you
Remind me that I'm older
To be brave smart, sweet and bolder
And don't give up on what we're trying to do

Gonna make it really long
So everyone can see
That I'm very unhappy

I wish I wasn't always wrong
I wish it wasn't always alone
The finger that you're pointing
Has knocked me on my knees
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry

It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.

I wonder what my mom and dad would say
If I told them that I cry each day
It's hard enough to live so far away

I wish I wasn't always cold
I wish I wasn't always alone
When the party is over how will I get home?
And all you need to know is I'm so sorry

It's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow.

If all the rules are meant to bend
And you swore you were my friend
Now I have to start all over again

'Cause no one's going to take your place
And I'm scared I'll never save
All the pieces of the love we made.

And I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that I can slip and fall

And you won't let me go just to let me know
That growing up goes slow.

And I'm so sorry, it's not like me
It's maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know that growing up goes slow",Sad Song

The meaning of a tragedy, ooh
You might be surprised to hear it's you and me
When it comes down to it
You never made the most of it, ooh
So I cried, cried, cried
And now, I say goodbye

And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love

When did you decide
I didn't have enough to buy?
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
For the fire and the sleepless nights

And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love
I don't call this love

In the sea of lovers without ships
And lovers without sign
You're the only way out of this
Sea of lovers losing time
And lovers losing hope
Will you let me follow you
Wherever you go
Bring me home

A certain type of wind has swept me up
But till it's found each bone
I, I'm overcome
There is an icy breath that escapes my lips
And I am lost again

In the sea of lovers without ships
And lovers without sign
You're the only way out of this
Sea of lovers losing time
And lovers losing hope
You're the only way out of this
Sea of lovers without ships
And lovers without sign
You're the only way out of this
Sea of lovers losing time
And lovers losing hope
Will you let me follow you
Wherever you go
Bring me home",Sea of Lovers

Changes, fast and growing
I knew better then
I knew better then

Words that hurt the ones you lovin'
Hatred for who you're becomin'
I knew better then yes
I knew better then

To trust myself
To trust someone else
To trust the lies that slip from my mouth
Trust the heart I'm so quick to sell

Yes I knew better then
I knew better then
To trust love again

Memories who won't stop stinging
Promises I could't believe in
I knew better then
I knew better then

To trust myself
To trust someone else
To trust the doubt in the back of my mind
Trust the trail of pain left behind
Yes, I knew better then
I knew better then to trust love again

And I'm so quick to lose
What was never mine to keep
And I cannot stand (oh) what's broken under me
I don't know how to forgive
Myself for everything that I missed
Learn trust

Christina Perri,"All of the lights land on you
The rest of the world fades from view
And all of the love I see
Please please say you feel it too
And all of the noise I hear inside
Restless and loud, unspoken and wild
And all that you need to say
To make it all go away
It's that you feel the same way too

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth

And all of the steps that led me to you
And all of the hell I had you walk through
But I wouldn't trade a day for the chance to say
My love, I'm in love with you

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth

I know that we're both afraid
We both made the same mistakes
An open heart is an open wound to you
And in the wind there's a heavy choice
Love has a quiet voice
Still you mind, now I'm yours to choose

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
Let my love be the light that guides you home

And I know
The scariest part is letting go
'Cause love is a ghost you can't control
I promise you the truth can't hurt us now
So let the words slip out of your mouth",The Words

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Alles entrückt

Gib mir den Sommer zurück
Jeden Tag, Stück für Stück
Gib mir den Sommer zurück

Du hast mir gefehlt, obwohl du bei mir warst
Es ist so still hier, weil du nichts sagst
Als wären wir gestrandet in diesen Moment
Was uns bleibt ist nur Sand
Der in den Fingern zerrinnt
In meinem Leben fehlt jetzt ein Stück
Die Trage war nur geliehen

Gib mir den Sommer zurück
Jedes Wort, jeden Schritt
Gib mir den Sommer zurück
Jeden Tag, Stück für Stück
Gib mir den Sommer zurück

Ich will, dass das Blatt sich wendet
Das es wieder weiter geht
Einen neuen Anfang
Der noch nicht geschrieben steht
In der Endlosschleife
Habe ich auf Stopp gedrückt
Und alles steht still
Ich will den Sommer zurück

Vollkommen verrückt

Hat wirklich gelebt

Stab you in the back and they just don't care
Doing the slide

Now slander is a loving tongue
They speak your name to everyone
Never is a curse left unsung
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Christine Collister,"The sun burned hot, it burned my eyes 
Burned so hot I thought I'd died 
Thought I'd died and gone to hell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 
I went to the river but the river was dry 
I fell to my knees an I looked to the sky 
I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell 
I saw the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

I was ready for love I was ready for the money 
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey 
Ready for the winnin', ready for the bell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 
I found some love and I found some money 
Found that blood would drip from the honey 
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

Well I did it for kicks and I did it for faith 
I did it for lust and I did it for hate 
I did it for need and I did it for love 
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove 
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night 
And the three of us were a terrible sight 
Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell 
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 

I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage 
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage 
I took my trouble down a deadend trail 
Reachin' out a hand for a holier grail 
Hey there mama did you carry that load 
Did you tell your baby 'bout the bend in the road 
'Bout the rebel yell 'bout the one that fell 
Lookin' for the water from a deeper well 

Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well 
Well...lookin for the water from a deeper well

Crowding round the door

Christine Collister,"I want to vanish
This is my fondest wish
To go where I cannot be captured
Laid on a decorated dish
Even in splendor this curious fate
Is more than I care to surrender
Now it's too late

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

If you should stumble upon my last remark
I'm crying in the wilderness
I'm trying my best to make it dark
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most
I'm certain as a lost dog
Pondering a sign post

When my restlessness is past
And I can lie down on my blanket
And release my fists at last

I am heading for a time of solitude
Of peace without illusions
When the perfect circle
Marries all beginnings and conclusions

And when they say
That you're not good enough
Well the answer is
You're not
But who are they
Or what is it
That eats at what you've got
With the hunger of ambition
For the change inside the purse
They are handcuffs on the soul, my friends
Handcuffs on the soul
And worse

Where the sage and sweet grass grow
By a lake of sacred water

Christine Dente,"These are my sidewalks
They wounds around the neighborhood
Always led me straight and safely home

But now they're uneven
'Cause roots move beneath them
And time won't leave well enough alone

And I had been trying to smooth these stones
Thought I could make my way alone

I tried the whimsical
Gauzy pink dresses
That spin in the wind when you twirl

But somehow the princess gown
Never did fit this girl
So I fled the garden for the tower

And I had been hiding behind these stones
Thought I'd be well enough alone

Then you came nearer
You held the mirror
I saw myself there in your eyes

And I had been running
Still you pursued
I watched you move each heavy stone

The thorns around me torn our skin
But you kept coming through
'Cause you won't leave well enough alone

I am becoming, your love becomes me",Becoming

To be a part of the conversation
Living in a bigger story
All this time was a history-in-the-making
I was headed for a destination
To take my place in the bigger story

So I listen in and I hear the song
From another country and I sing along
And I play my part as the story goes
And the difference that it will make
Is a tale yet to be told

How much did You give until I finally got a glimpse of what love can do?
How far, how much and just how long did You wait for me?

I will always stand in wonder
How Your love for me could be so strong
And I will never really understand the kind of love that lasts so long?

How much would I suffer for the sake of Your sweet name, I don't know
How far would I go and just how much would I give for you?

Could you see inside yourself
The things I saw in no one else
Put a little faith in me
Could you believe

Don't pull me in, don't pull me in,

Christine Fellows,"Wears his chin down very low. lower than I'll ever know. he's outside throwing his heart up in the snow. been a long time coming and I guess it had to go.

you see, he's just a cowboy. a spider in a jar. he should've been outside singing his song to the stars. yippeeo. 

do you think we could drive all night 'til the sun comes around. stick our fingers in our ears and fall to the ground. if nobody's been listening, well I don't understand.

Christine Fellows,"I was only seventeen. Hauling frantically
On the back of a matchbook.
I don't think that I could've looked in you in the eye.
So fearful of what I might ignite.
But I kind of hoped you'd stayed.

I was barely home a day, plotting my escape
With a dartboard and a blindfold.
But the dart she landed shy, nearly taking out your eye
As you walked passed the window, singing,

Baby please. Don't you go.
Bound to choices, bound to hopeless solutions
Holding terrors unaddressed.
Where's your sense of misdirection?
Left clinging to the shreds of self respect.

Would you do it all again, the same way as the first
Set of second chances.
A stronger one might still crumble underneath the weight of doubt
And still decide to run away.

Bound to choices, bound to hopeless solutions
Holding terrors unexpressed.
With our worn out resolutions we're caught up in the web of our regrets.",Regrets

Only windows.
All thrown open am I.

Shot straight from the sky into your heart.
When slings for your limbs and a breaking fall
Are all you need.

Paper thin.
Turning over and over again.
You've been spared but barely there.

I fall in your arms when your head is turned.
Shot straight from the sky into your heart.

Are all you need.",Trust

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine

She got a hundred thousand dogs
They're just about the ugliest of things

They crap right in the road
And then they chase me in my car
And when there's nothing else to do
I watch them humping in the yard

Cuz I'm a Southern Girl now
Yes I'm a Southern Girl now

I go to the diner
where the waitress calls me ""Hon""

Our breasts look just like that

Now, feminism isn't gonna
Make it big out here
So all you little ladies
Get this message loud and clear
It says right in the bible
It's your husband you obey
And you'll call it ""family values""

Well mister they are huge
The car you drive is so endowed
I guess you must be too

Those ten foot tires on your truck
Will give us quite a view
When we go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...
On Patton Avenue)

I guess you sense my sarcasm
I guess I'll tell you true
I think your truck is ugly
I think Jesse Helms is too

That I ""might-could go on home""

Christine Lavin,"Oh, Johnny and Janie, they were the perfect married couple
But not in bed
Oh, they tried taking drugs, How-To books, even Dr. Ruth
But for all intents and purposes their love life was dead

'Til one day Janie went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
She bought a long cylindrical thing
Now Janie is smiling, Johnny is not
Every night you can hear him sing

He says, ""Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that little pink machine
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''

Oh, Johnny went down to the barroom
He bought one drink, he bought two, he bought three
Oh, he moaned to the bartender, the state of his married life
Bartender said, ""Hey Bud, just listen to me''

So Johnny went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
He bought a plastic blow-up doll
Now Johnny is smiling, Janie is not
She is angry, she is jealous, she's appalled

She says, ""Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that poly-ethylene
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''

(Wires)
Switches

(Batteries)

(Plastic)
Tufts of artificial hair

Who'd ever think they could replace the love
(Love)
Humans used to share?
(Humans used to, humans used to)
(Humans used to, humans used to)

Then one fateful day those batteries died
At the same moment that, that big doll sprung a leak
Johnny looked at Janie looked at Johnny looked at Janie
Oh, they both found it difficult to speak

I wish I could say they threw those contraptions away
And fell in love all over again
But Johnny taped up that hissing woman
When Janie stole the batteries from his Sony Walkman

Because their love is bein kept alive by artificial means
They've grown emotionally attached to those modern sex machines
Their relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause their love is being kept alive, love is being kept alive
Love is being kept alive by artificial means

Christine Lavin,"Do you remember that song by Janis Ian?
The one where she complains about
Not getting chosen for the basketball team?

Her song went, ""For those whose names are never called
When choosing sides for basketball""
Remember that depressing song?
I would have written about that but she did it first

When you're 5 foot 2
Okay, 5 one and a half
And everybody else in the whole gym class
If 5 foot 3 and even taller, it hurts

Truth is I hadn't thought about that for years
But then a recent phone call rekindled all those fears
""A softball game "", Robin said, ""And you're invited""

Softball? Great, that's my game
Why softball's practically my middle name
I'll be right over I said, feeling excited

Even though I can't throw, I can't hit
I can't run, I must admit
I can't catch, I can't pitch
In softball I have not found my niche

But I don't let details get in my way
Team sports, ooh, that's what I loves to play
I got dressed, got my sneakers tied
Made it to the park in time for choosing sides

Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, ooh
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, ooh
Glove? Sure I own a glove
But it's in the repair shop with my rugby helmet

But I can always borrow from the other team
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me
Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me

This part goes on for a long, long time
Because 20 people showed up to play and they picked 10 to a side
So as the ranks of the chosen grew and the unchosen we depleted
I tried to act nonchalant

'Cause deja vu, I was the last one chosen
Even after the overdressed Felicity Rosen
Do you know her?
She was wearing high heels

Stockings with seams and those Lee stick on nails
And they picked her before me
They put me in the field so far out and to the right
I was practically out of sight

But everybody said, I had a real good day
I didn't make any errors, I didn't make any plays
You see, the ball never came out my way
And I figured it's just gonna be one of those days

Now, coming up to bat was a whole new kind of humbling experience
I took one swing and missed, that was no surprise
I took another swing and missed, that was no surprise
Then I practiced strategy, I let one go by, the umpire called it a ball
I had a proud moment

Then the pitcher figured me out
He threw one I just couldn't resist, I swung and I actually hit it
But it was a pathetic little dribbler that went
Bloop, bloop, bloop, right back to the pitcher

Who threw it over to first and I was out which again is no surprise
But as I was walking to the bench to pick up my borrowed glove
To captain of the other team said to the captain of my team
""Hey, she really doesn't know how to play so let's not count her outs""

Not count my outs? Not count my outs? What are you talking about?
I want you to count my outs, I want my outs to count
Which made me unpopular with my entire team
So I said, ""Don't count my outs""

What a great idea and it makes me feel so special
Thank you for being such a sensitive human being
And thinking of my needs in such an open
Kind and generous way

I really said something like that
I was babbling like an idiot

Well, eventually I resumed my place in the outfield
And continued watching the dandelions
Grow and blossom and turn into puffs
And blow away in the chilly wind

I continued watching the clouds making ugly formations in the sky
And it wasn't long before I began to question my worth as a human being
And my reason for living

But then top of the seventh
Two on, two out, a crack of the bat, a mighty clout
My whole team turned and cringed to see
That speeding ball heading vaguely toward me

I ran as fast as I could, I said a prayer
I stuck out my glove, the ball landed in there
No one could believe it on either team
They hooped and hollered and stomped and screamed
And total strangers clapped and cheered

(Aware that God had performed a miracle here)
I was carried to the bench, I was handed a beer
Then the clouds broke apart
Then the sun reappeared

No, it didn't, but it felt like it did in my heart
I wanted to live again

Oh, by the way we lost that game 17 to 3
But I considered it a moral victory
And Janis Ian, wherever you might be
Take heart, there's hope for you 'cause there's hope for me

Take me out to the ballgame, take me out to the crowd
Buy me some peanuts, I'll buy you Crackerjacks
As long as you count my outs when I come up to bat

Now it's root, root, root, root, root, root for both teams
Win or lose, lose or win we're all the same

Oh, won't you please take me out to the old ball game?
Come on, please take me out to the old ball game

Though things have not been bad, you can't say you've had
Quite as good a time as it first seemed.
The reality of me is not what you write love songs about.
You'd rather be longing from afar;

And she's a thousand miles gone, and that's fine,

And tonight when you sleep you'll keep dreaming of the love

And the happiness you're so sure she will bring.

Christine Lavin,"Back in the 1850s this town just teemed with life
150,000 Miners all were dreaming of a strike
7,000 live here in Castlemaine
And he still works for the mines
Extracts 2 grams of gold per ton of sand
Dust the gold rush left behind.

I met him on a November Day 
The Australian sun was bright
He squinted his eyes
He lit a cigarette
Another rough night.
The house he shared with his wife and babies
He had built with his own two hands
He could no longer call it home
In his place, another man
So he lives here with a friend of his
His wife lives down the street
They joke that it's a halfway house for men
Suffering temporary defeat
He makes me a cup of coffee 
I notice his young (bud) weathered hands
Tanned except for where it was he wore a wedding band.

He askes me about America
A place he would love to be
He's been all over Australia
He's seen all there is to see
He shows me pictures of Ayers Rock
Wild Birds and Kangaroos
Pictures of his little ones
And his wife too
Then he said put out your hand 
And I will give to you what I found on a recent trip
He lays in my palm a mound of multi colored opal chips
When his fingers touch mine 
I feel a longing from within
Did that originate from me or from him?
But it's 4:00
He leaves for work
He returns home late that night
I'm in the room right down the hall
I can hear him snap on the light
I hear him softly humming
I hear a turning of a page
I dream that night of wild birds trapped inside an opal cage.

In the morning when I get up
He's in the kitchen making tea
He smiles and he says he's got one more parting gift for me

Katy's got a lot of rhythm when she wiggles, for a little kid, she's got soul

That night when her mom and dad come home 
I tell them what she said to me 
I figure they'll think I'm some kind of babysitting genius

I think back to what I know was the best day of my life 
It was wintertime 
Ten years ago
We were staying in a farmhouse 
In the middle of Vermont
The hills were covered with Christmas trees 
And freshly fallen snow 

Instantly I picture the vivid details of that day 
When you told me that you loved me more than you could ever say
The air was a bracing cold
The sky a startled blue 
Never before or since 
Have I felt that close to you

What does that say about you and me and the last ten years 
I've learned to live with your silence
You've learned to overlook my tears
Now this dancing three year old in her simple perfect way 
Has me questioning the basis for the life we live today

Katy's probably sleeping now 
I wonder if she dreams about 
Flying with the angels
Dancing with moonbeams

You are snoring right out loud

Christine Lavin,"I dropped a token into the slot.
Pushed through the turnstile.
There was a woman at the end of the platform
Waiving her arms around, kind of wild.

""Come here,"" she wailed. ""There's a puppy on the rails.
I think it has been hurt.""
I raced down to where she was pointing 
to see a ball of fur covered with dirt.

""It must be dead,"" I said to her,
as I turned to leave.
""No, it's alive,"" she cried. ""Just before you got here,
I swear, I saw it breath.""

""And I'll watch for the train if you'll jump down.
Pick him up and hand it to me.
If we take him to the vet, if we save his life,
Think how wonderful that'll be.""

I looked into the tunnel, there was no train in sight.
I looked at the furry thing lying there, a truly pitiful sight.
""Look,"" I said. ""I'm not sure that's a puppy.
Could be a lice-infested, long-haired rat.
And it's gotta be dead, so I'm not jumping down,"" 
and I figured that that was that.


But by now more people arrived on the platform, and she said,
""Help. There's a puppy on the tracks.""
They looked for a moment, and like true New Yorkers,
collectively turned their backs.
She said, ""Somebody's gotta do something,"" 
As we slowly turned around again.
""Someone must have the courage to save him.
It's a puppy. It's man's best friend.""

""Trains come through here every few minutes.""
Said a man wearing madras pants.
""And it's way too dangerous. You'd have to be nuts,
to take such a foolish chance.""
But the woman was insistent. ""In the time we've been debating,""
She said ""One of you could've jumped down.
Handed him to me, by now that puppy could be 
at the animal shelter cross town!"" 

We felt bad, but no one would do it. 
Then a transit cop appeared.
Down at the other end of the platform
We all yelled ""Hey you! Come here!""
He ran to us, I pointed to the train tracks and said,
""See that thing, furry, not to big.
What do you think it is, he looked and said,...

""What? You mean that wig?""

We stepped back. A rush of embarrassment swept right through the crowd.
Accented by the blast of a train whistle,
Approaching and growing quite loud.
The ""be	"" train flattened that furry thing.
We got on board, went on our way.
Grateful that we did not risk our lives 
to save a life of a wig that day.



So if you see something on the train tracks,
Take a tip from me.
Don't let anybody talk you into saving it,
It's best to just let it be.
And if you see a person wearing 
what looks like a puppy on their head,
Don't call the police, it's only a wig,...

Christine McVie,"Most of the time my head is spinning
Other things on my mind
But once in a while
I'm thrown back into that dark place
Where you reside

(Trapped)In the middle
Of a lousy love affair
(Hurt)Just a little
Johnny says come around if you dare

I tried to reach out so many times
But you were simply never there
I blame myself for my own pain
My misery and despair

(Trapped)In the middle
Of a lousy love affair
(Hurt)Just a little
Johnny says come around if you dare

I forgive you
And the spell that you cast
And all that loneliness
Well that's a thing of the past
Yes I forgive you
And the ties that bind
All that emptiness
Yes I've left it all behind

(Trapped)In the middle
(Hurt)Just a little

I forgive you
And the spell that you cast
And all that loneliness
Well that's a thing of the past
Yes I forgive you
And the ties that bind
All that emptiness
Yes I've left it all behind

For the spell that you cast
And the ties that bind





",Forgiveness
Christine McVie,"
Long ago
Before the moon was young
And before the first love song
Had ever been sung
We both knew
Beyond a shadow of doubt
What loving somebody
Was really all about

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

When the sun goes down
In this sleepy little town
All the world keeps spinning
And the planets turn around
All alone
Lonely as the stars
Well I just wanna be
Wanna be where you are

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

Repeat Chorus

When the sun goes down
And you're not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really miss my friend



",Friend
Christine McVie,"You made me calm
After the storm
And you gave me strength darlin'
Made me feel safe and warm

So much love
So many lessons learned
For all that you gave me darlin'
You wanted nothing in return

That's why I'm givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you
I am givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you

When there was doubt
You gave me faith
When there was emptiness all around me
Well you know you filled that space

That's why I'm givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you
I am givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you

When you feel it
Why don't you pass it along
And then you'll never, no never, never go wrong

So I tripped and I fell
I got lost for a little while
But you caught me in your loving arms
Rescued me with your smile

That's why I'm givin' it back
Givin' it back, givin' it back to you
I am givin' it back
Givin' it back, to you



",Givin' It Back
Christine McVie,"Well you cruised into my life
With promised on your sweet lips
With lies on your honeyed tongue
And magic in your fingertips

Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts
Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts

Lost in the world of your illusions
In which you played the shining knight
I'm turning from your heart of darkness
Into the light

You're the Jack of Hearts
Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts

Just another old dirty game
You're shuffling the cards
You think you've got the winner darlin'
But I'm the one who truly stars

Never thought I was a gambler
Never thought I could be your clown
But with one roll of the dice baby
My walls came tumbling down

Lost in the world of your illusions
In which you played the shining knight
I'm turning from your heart of darkness
Into the light

Never thought I was a gambler
Never thought I could be your clown
But with one roll of the dice baby
My walls came tumbling down

Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts
Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts
Liar, you're the Jack of Hearts

Christine Rosholt,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn

With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby",All I Want for Christmas (Is You)
Christmas All Stars,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Christmas Carol Cats,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel! 

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

Christoph Spendel,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart

Un grand soleil, les jours de pluie
Elle a changé ma vie morose
Pour un bouquet de fantaisies

Comme un interdit elle joue ma vie
Comme un succès qui lui sourit
A sa manière, elle a chevauché mon ego

Moi qui dormais dans ses silences
Je me réveille pour goûter à son sommeil
J'ai le sentiment d'avoir trouvé
Le cœur en apnée un trésor qui vaut de l'or

Comme un interdit
Elle m'offre une chance, à contresens
Mille et une nuits perdu d'avance
Mille et un jour perdu d'amour

Moi qui rêvais la liberté
D'un grand oiseau, allegro moderato
J'ai le sentiment d'avoir trouvé
Le cœur en apnée un trésor qui vaut de l'or

Ma cavalière me fait tanguer
Entre ses bras et me chavire
D'un seul baiser, me fait couler
Maître-nageur qui tombe à l'eau

Comme un interdit

Où elle conduit, de préférence
Je me laisse faire, amoureux fou

Ma cavalière me fait tanguer
Entre ses bras, je m'abandonne

Il y a eu tant d'amoureux
Tant de passants provisoire

Et puis soudain
De mon coeur à son coeur comme l'écho
D'un amour qui me laisse sans voix
Toujours dans mon ombre
La nuit soupire, me dévisage

Sans rendezvous, là, d'un seul coup
Elle boit le bleu de mes rêves
J'attends son heure
Quand le soir ouvre le bal
Je me pique à son étoile
L'enfer commence avec L

Sous les arcades de ses yeux
J'envisage mes nouveaux cernes
Cocktail de pâleur, bloody mortel
Mon mauvais ange
Se change, pour me plaire

En belle de nuit
Et son souffle sur mes lèvres
Joue avec le feu
Sans éteindre ma vie joue encore

Sans rendezvous, là, d'un seul coup
Elle boit le bleu de mes rêves
Puis m'abandonne
Quand le jour ferme le bal
Son éternité me tue
L'enfer commence avec L

Aucun miroir ne peut la voir
M'enlacer pour mieux me glacer
Je sens sa fièvre
Comment garder mon sang-froid?

It's funny how some distance 
Makes everything seem small 
And the fears that once controlled me 
Can't get to me at all 

Time to see what I can do 
To test the limits and break through 
No right or wrong, no rules for me 
I'm free 

Let it go, let it go 
I am one with the wind and sky 
Let it go, let it go 
You'll never see me cry 
Here I stand and here I stay 
Let the storm rage on 

My power flurries through the air into the ground 
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around 
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast 
I'm never going back, the past is in the past 

Let it go, Let it go 
And I'll rise like the break of dawn 
Let it go, let it go

De nos amours anciennes
Je connais bien la saison
Oui c'est vrai que l'on se prend tous des beignes
On pleure, on rit, on saigne
On la connaît la chanson

Posé sur le bord de la berge comme
Une barque en bois qui se noie
Je me rappelle qu'elle me faisait du bien
Alors ce soir le monde pourra m'attendre car
Je resterai certainement là
Simplement je me souviens

Comme elle contemplait la lune
En me disant tout bas
Je me sens toute étourdie
De te voir le cœur dans la brume
Et plus vraiment là
Quand le ciel s'assombrit

Quand vient la saison de l'automne
Tout me rappelle que je l'aime encore
Alors je laisse mon amour à l'automne
Et dans ses dentelles tous mes remords

L'été j'imagine ma belle plongée dans une robe en soie
Faisant autour d'elle bien d'autres dégâts
C'est vrai qu'elle n'allait pas rester là à m'attendre mais
Quand l'été s'en va
Tu sais moi je me souviens ouais

Comme je contemplais la lune
En lui disant tout bas
Moi je n'ai qu'une envie
Revenir voir si la lagune est encore là
Ou si tout est fini

Toi ma douloureuse rengaine
Je t'en prie lâche-moi
Je t'en supplie lâche-moi.","Ma douleur, ma peine"
Christophe Maé,"Le soleil cogne dans le creux de la plaine
A croire que Dieu me rejette
Le soleil me brûle la peau et les veines
Et j'en est mal à la tête

Le sommeil me quitte et les prières sont vaines
Et je voit les vautours qui me guettent
Le sommeil habite les rivières anciennes
Et toi le désert de ma peine

OK!

Alors je traîne mon âme
Et le prêtre dit tu l'a cherché
Alors je traîne mon âme
Et le chamane lui m'a relevé

Je pense à toi mon pays ma jolie

Que sans toi je perds le nord oui ma jolie

Christophe Maé,"Les yeux dans le vide, elle me regarde passer
Dans le creux de ses rides moi j'ai trébuché
Ça me fait mal au bide
Sa belle gueule cassée comme une étoile livide à deux doigts de tomber
Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé
Quand je lui tend la main à travers la fumée

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé
Peut-être que l'hiver ne l'aurait pas brisée

Un pied dans le vide, elle a déménagé
Elle perd son équilibre entre deux larmes salées
Y'a comme un goût acide qui entre ses baisers
Elle dit qu'elle est lucide, non, plus jamais se caser
Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé
Quand je lui tend la main à travers la fumée

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé
Peut-être que l'hiver ne l'aurait pas brisée

Et ton cœur en hiver je le garde au chaud,
En attendant le retour du soleil
Et si le mien passe l'hiver au chaud,
Sache que sur toi je veille

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et je tombe dans le bayou

Je crois pas au hasard,
Le jour comme le soir, tu me tiens chaud
Comme l'ébène et l'ivoire,
Viens on va s’asseoir au vieux piano
Alors tu laisses ton cœur décider, ton cœur hésiter
Mais j'aimerai t'entendre dire

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et je tombe dans le bayou

Laissons passer les heures,
Laissons passer nos peurs
Et laisse faire ouais, laisse faire le bonheur
Rempli toi de candeur, rempli moi de douceur
Et roulons nous dans les fleurs

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et sautons dans le bayou

Je connais par cœur le bord du Mississippi
Même si je ne suis pas de là,

Même si je ne suis pas d'ici,

Christophe Willem,"Un mug tombe ""Bam"" s'explose sous mon lit
Le café latte se jette sur le sol et je crie
Un fracas de plus dans ma vie
Une tasse en moins, c'est ainsi
Toi tu pars me laisses en vrac
cette fois c'est fini

Je te veux sans filet
Sur un nuage de lait
Te boire serré
Oh oui serré

Et je fends la foule et je risque ma vie
De China Town à Little Italy
Trempé, groggy sous la pluie
""No you can't stay for coffee ?""
Ton coeur est en rade et moi je cours toujours
Tu me dis ""No way"" mais je reste sourd
Juste un café mon amour
""No you can't stay for coffee ?""
""No you can't stay for coffee ?""

Tu me donnes le torride comme jamais
Puis à l'aube, sans un mot tu disparais
Je veux tout savoir de ta vie
A quoi tu rêves et à qui
La caféine m'aide à tenir jour et nuit

Ca laisse un goût amer
Comme un orage dans l'air
A ma tempe tape un boucan d'enfer

Paris, London, Sud Manhattan
taxi, subway, je cours, je crie soudain je te vois
""No you can't stay for coffee ?""

Tes yeux, ta peau, tes hanches
entre mes doigts et toi qui penches on s'embrasse en angle droit
""No you can't stay for coffee ?""

Une heure
A moi
Chez toi
Un café crème, oh tu me dois bien ça

Tournent à l'envers

Gravats de rancœurs et d'effroi

Il faudrait en rire

Que ça fait mal

Et là moi je fais quoi
Après toi
Mes rêves sont vides
Je ne fais que des faux pas
Je fais quoi
Ici-bas
Les beaux souvenirs me brûlent de froid
Sans toi, moi je sers à quoi

Des rues sans couleurs
Le monde est en deuil
Si vide et si seul
Et pourtant si rempli de toi
Déclaré coupable
Toi tu vas au diable
A moi les chemins de croix

Pourquoi pas sourire

Christopher Blackmon,"There is a joy in the journey,
There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",El Shaddai

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

To be torn and lost in the wilderness

And lonely after all

It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel tonight
Sometimes love just slips out of sight

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

And I'll never be the same without you here
I'll live alone and hide myself behind my tears
And I'll never be the same without your love
I'll live alone and try so hard to rise above

The years go by
There's always someone new
To try and help me forget about you
Time and again, it does me no good
Love never feels the way that it should

I loved you then, I guess I'll love you forever
And even though I know we could never stay together
I'll think of how it could have been
If we could just start all over again

And I'll never be the same without you here
I'll live alone and hide myself behind my tears
And I'll never be the same without your love
I'll live alone and try so hard to rise above

It was good for me
It was good for you
Now nothing either of us can say or do
Can change the way you feel today
Sometimes love just slips away

Just one thing before you go
Just one thing that you've got to know
No one will ever touch me that way
The way that you did that very first day

And I'll never be the same without you here
I'll live alone and hide myself behind my tears
And I'll never be the same without your love
I'll live alone and try so hard to rise above

the spring
Take hold of their hallowed souls
And save them from pain

Save ourselves from all of the pain

Left in the years and lost in the war
Dearly held are the loves
Save for the ones you lose on

So struck by the hope of
the harmony
Leaving the sorrow

For so long, I can't remember

And I know that I'm just gonna be
Another page in love's history
Another page in your diary
In that old book of love
In that old book of love

And I know that I'm just gonna be
Another page in love's history
Another page in your diary
In that old book of love
In that old book of love

Talking in my sleep
",Talking in My Sleep
Christopher Cross,"Every once in a while
I'd see her smile
And she'd turn my day around
A girl with those eyes
Could stare through the lies
And see what your heart was saying

Think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

A friend of a friend
A friend till the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning

I know you and you're here
In everyday we live
I know her and she's here
I can feel her when I sing

Hey Laura, where are you now
Are you far away from here
I don't think so
I think you're here
Taking our tears away",Think of Laura
Christopher Cross,"Some like it hot, some like it cold
I like it best when it's untold
When I feel sad and when I feel down
Then I'll wish you were around

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me

Turn down the lights now, it's all been said
The troubles that come and go
You took my heart and threw it away
You left me out in the rain

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me
Just you wait, you wait and see
I will be there to love you

Oh, it's hard
So hard to live a life on your own
After you've known how it could be
With you and me

Won't you come home to me
You could make everything all right
You could warm me through the coldest night
And make it all right, all right

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me
Just you wait, you wait and see
I will be there to love you

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me
Just you wait, you wait and see
I will be there to love you

What am I supposed to believe
Is it that you really love me
Just you wait, you wait and see
I will be there to love you

Christopher Cross,"I can hear your voice and I have no choice
'Cause the pain is too deep inside
And the hurt of a love that is lost has no cure
But the love of another heart
Your friends try and say it will all get better
They say that they know how you feel
But your heart isn't sure 'cause it knows what it heard
All the things that it read in the letter

All the words of wisdom
Never seem to ease the pain
All the words of wisdom sound the same

All the lies of kindness
Oh that sweet refrain
But you pay the price for the joy that it brings
'Cause you hear the sound of her name
And the morning tries to save you
From the shadows of your heart
They dance and kiss as you reminisce
And it's tearing you apart",Words of Wisdom
Christopher Cross,"I guess I knew we'd come to this

When you're walking out that door
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye

Or they can hold you down
I can dance to the saddest song
But I won't let you stay
Where you don't belong
Oh, so while you're out there busy bein' free
Just remember
One of those roads leads back to me
Don't you say goodbye
Don't you say goodbye
When you're walking out that door
Careful what you say
You might be back someday
Baby, don't you say goodbye
I want you 
I need you
But I'll let you go
If you want it that way
It's your choice

Will whisper every day

Don't say goodbye
Girl, I'll tell you why
It just might turn out that way
Don't say goodbye

Takin' a shot into the dark
Hopin' that someone will see the spark
Of the light in you
Noah's ark to the ship of fools
Didn't we break all the golden rules
Caught in the dance of the hours
Open your heart 'til everyone's in
It's never too late to believe and begin
Open your heart 'til everyone's in
You can wish on the light of a star 'til the end
Everyone's out on the open sea
We're all a part of the mystery
You know how lonely it can be

Just play guitar and walk around
Until you turn into the sound
Of laughter
Some do believe we came out of the sky
And at the end we will fly",Open Your Heart
Christopher Cross,"There's a place I know called Swing Street
Where you can really feel the heartbeat
After working hard til sundown
The city comes alive

High up, low down, down on Swing Street
Gypsy jazzmen tickling my feet
Jive and music, love and money
There's enough to get you high

Sidewalk preachers hustling bibles
Longing for one more revival
There's a truth in all these dreamers
If you read between the lines

Well, it's all right watching the world come together
A real life movie that goes on forever
Take your chances and pull on the lever
Down on Swing Street

Down on Swing Street
Morning comes, that alarm clock screaming
Coat and tie, and wheeling, dealing
I wish that I could be back on Swing Street

Everyone looks for romance
Living out of magazines
But there's still one place

Where you don't have to fake it

It's a calm wind blowing on my skin
And I've been dreaming again
Now that we're all here

We can share these notes and all this madness
We can talk of innocence
And of all the things we believe in

Is it an alibi
Is it the reason why
Is it the way we really feel inside

Set it free
The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere
Daybreak

In a place I've known before
Will I find me behind that final door
I can hear the footsteps of the past
I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast
I'm gonna spend some time with the moon
Pour myself a glass of midnight
Keep myself in tune

Is it an alibi
Is it the tears I cry
Is it the way I see it through your eyes

Christopher Cross,"I woke up to my world this morning
Took a long look in the looking glass
Last night I guess I had one or too many
Somebody tried to tell me I had no class
What ever happened to me

Maybe I've been living on lies
Never really had a dream come true
Then again I guess I never really tried
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the roads I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time

Wish I'd finished that book I never started
Maybe that's the story of my life
Should've learned to play that saxophone
So I could tell my song to the streetlight
Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own
Could've had a wife and a child
Should've made that house a home
I don't know why my life is so wild
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the chances I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind

So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight
I've got to get my shadow behind me
Try and make some sense of it all
With my feet on the ground and my heart still free
As the years will slip away

I'll let the cards fall where they may
And all the roads I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
As the years will slip away

And the cards fall as they may

I was a girl who trusted no one with my heart
And the dreams that young girls dream were just vanishing in the
Dark.

How we fall so easily in

A girl breaks a boy's heart
Goodbye is a very hard word to forget
But I think I finally met

To take away those yesterdays
Oh she loves me, she told me so
As a tear came to her eye
And I love her, I will, I know
Love her for the rest of my life
Once more I'm feeling like I'm out of control
'Cause the girl's got a serious hold
On me

And part of me says run away
But I want to stay
Should I be up front or cool
Which way is playing the fool
The only time I know what's right
Is when I hear her telling me
Somewhere there's a star in the sky of every night
Shining for the love of hearts
The light of that star, like the hand of a friend

Christopher Cross,"Lately I see clouds of sorrow in your eyes
Some deep sadness you can never quite disguise
Now I'm scared to ask what it's leading to
But I'm more afraid of not asking you

Is there something that you want to tell me
Is there something that I ought to know
Are we something that's still worth fighting for
Or should I simply let you go
Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
I'll find some way to convince you to stay
If you just tell me honestly
Is there something left of you and me

You've got secrets you've been keeping for too long
And I'm going crazy acting like there's nothing wrong
I can taste the truth every time we kiss
And I can't go on
At least not like this

I don't want to lose you
But what's the use of holding on
I don't really have you
If the feeling's gone

Is there something I can do to reach you
Are we something more than history
If there's no way to convince you to stay
And be the way we used to be
Then there's something that I want to tell you
And I want you to believe it's true
We had something that I'll never forget
Even if I wanted to
'Cause part of me will always be with you",Is There Something
Christopher Cross,"Maybe things are not what they seem
And baby we know it 
I feel like I'm wakin' up out of a dream
And we both want to control it 
I don't want to make a wrong move
I don't want to lose a good groove
So baby let's talk about it
Baby let's think

Isn't it love
Isn't it love that we are feeling
Isn't it love
Isn't it love
Isn't it time we stop concealing
Isn't it love

We don't have to love by the rules
So baby enjoy it
Bein' a fool for love don't make us fools
Don't let anyone destroy it 
You need a home to run to
You need to have your fun too
So baby let's talk about it
Baby let's think

Isn't it love
Isn't it love that we are feeling
Isn't it love
Isn't it love
Isn't it time we start revealing
Isn't it love

And from the dawn of time
People lookin' for souls that rhyme
People lookin' people lookin' for souls that rhyme
But when our worlds collide
You gotta see it from a different side somehow
You just gotta say
We don't want to make a wrong move
We don't want to lose a good groove
So baby let's talk about it
Talk to me and tell me how you feel
Can we really live without it
Baby let's think

Isn't it love that we are feeling
Isn't it love
Isn't it love
Isn't it time we start the healing

Christopher Cross,"I've heard there could be desire
So strong you would brave the fire
Until now I made them liars
Now there is you

'Cause something about your touch
Is making me feel too much
And letting you go is such a hard thing to do
And when the dawn is closing in

I know I need to drown in your love again
I'd chase the night across the world
To spend one more minute with you
When morning lay just ahead

And daybreak invades our bed
I'll steal you away instead
And fly to the dark
'Cause when the dawn is closing in

I know I need to drown in your love again
I'd chase the night across the world

On to Babylon
Where the light can't find us

Over and over again",Night Across the World
Christopher Cross,"The boys find a home in a family born of hate
The girls plant desperate love
In a womb that just won't wait
Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart

Through a twisted fate
As walls come down and spirits rise
The business of fear never dies
The artful dodgers with their false alarms

Take from the mouths to feed the arms
Pit god against god for a piece of land
They think they hear his words but they don't understand
Like a river lost on its way to the sea

Where is humanity
I know that nothing will change
'Til it changes in me
'Til it changes in you

A plague upon the mind

From the fallen forest to the poison bay

Christopher Cross,"All across the sky
The mysteries of faith
Fossils of desire all assume their rightful place
Is there any danger in their fire
Is there any solace in their wake
Could it really make a world of difference for goodness sake

To a sympathetic moon
Carrying the stories of every heart, earned wound
Will there be a lover at the station
Will there be a last conductor's call
Will there really be a happy ending after all

[Chorus]
To the rendezvous
Fortunes to be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where we can find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time

Painting the horizon
A mast beyond the blue
Caught up in the tempest of another point of view
Could there be a mutiny in the making
Could it be a lorelei in song
Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along

Will there be a jewel beneath the boulder
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all

Christopher Cross,"Everyone maybe once or twice
Finds a friend that's a friend for life
Somebody who believed in me like you
From those days of childhood fights
Through the nights when we'd ask advice
All of those times when nobody else would do

Any old time that you wanna hear from me
To find your way or kick around a memory
Like the old times
Any old time will do

I can tell when the telephone rings
It's gonna be you just to talk about things
It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind
Every time good love goes bad
When I can't believe the luck I've had
All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine

Any old time that you need to call on me
To find your way or kick around those memories
Like the old times
Any old time will do

Don't you ever forget
Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb
And you think maybe you've had enough
Just like the old times
Any old time you're blue

All at once I went and got a hunch
Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said

Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold
Something Sally said that stuck in my head
And I never wanna let it go

Any old time that you need to lean on me
I'll be there, you can dream on me
Just like the old times
Any old time will do",Any Old Time

But the meat is clean
The best take advantage of you like a machine
You gotta charm that snake now, maybe

Don't let the fingernails
Under the heart
If they get a good grip
They're gonna rip it apart
The first and last kisses 
Are the dangerous part
You gotta charm that snake now, maybe

There's a hook in the bait
The first one made a mistake

Christopher Cross,"We think about the loves we lost
Will it come again?
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win?

We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way?
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away

Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you
To the dream that's waitin' to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world

Is it gold or glory
A taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body?
There are all these things with every turn of the world

Human kindness - diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin, after all

When you find yourself alone
Missing tender magic touching you
Keep an open heart

We all want a world full of love

It's never too soon

Hey, don't you know my name
It wasn't all that long ago
I had my fifteen minutes of fame

If it was you, caught in a crazy game
Would you still look as good standing in the rain
Whatever gets you through the night
Take it from me, it's gonna be alright

Been there done that
Been there, then somebody takes you back
Been there done that
So hard, hard to avoid the trap

They break your heart, why do we let them in
The drug is strong but the will is weak
We make the same mistakes again
There comes a time we all gotta rise above
Look inside and redefine, just what it is we want from love

Been there done that
Been there, still working my way back
Been there done that
So hard, hard to avoid the trap

And when you feel strong enough to face up to it
You're gonna do just fine

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

We looked at each other in the same way then

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then

Christopher Jak,"Oh no, I think I'm falling in love again
It's nothing new
It's just that this time, its with you

I stand amazed that a beauty like yours
Could exist in a world like this 
And that you would see me 
And my name would fall from your lips
I wanna cry like the child that I am 
To think I may never hear it again
Is this the wrong time for the right thing,
Is it anything at all?
I'm helpless like a teardrop who just does not wanna fall.
I will dry up into a puddle of salt 
And I'll sting as I lick my own wounds

Oh no, I think I'm falling in love again
It's nothing new
It's just that this time, its with you

I wake each morning with my body on fire 
Cooled only by the touch of your hands
Each day that's to follow
And each night that is to come
I am breathing just to feel them again
Have you understood what I am trying to explain?
Its this delicately torturing pleasant little pain
I wonder now do you think of me in this same kind of way.
Do you think of me at all?

Oh no, I think I'm falling in love again
It's nothing new
It's just that this time, its with you

That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Too soon, too soon.

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth,
As it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
As we forgive our debtors.
(As we forgive those who trespass against us.)

And lead us not into temptation;
But deliver us from evil:
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

Sees the sun going down

Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Yes you run, you just won't show love 
That's the thing you're frightened of 

There's little hope but the fool that I am 
Still holding on to this dream of a man 
The taste of his skin, the gentle touch of his hand 
Is worth waiting for, so I must understand 
Yes you run, you just won't show love

Roar until it cried, more, more, more

Now he's back home doing nine to five
Living his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep
Old memories creep, more, more, more

Christy Love,"Where are those happy days they seem to hard to find?
I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.

Christy Mauro,"This affair is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainly
Tell me now I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or to go

Love me or leave me 
Or let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with someone else

You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love
But I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give it back tomorrow
For your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Christy Mauro,"To me, to me love is no go
Till fiddle and oboe start weeping, and wailing
That's my failing
He may be all wrong for me
But his is the only song for me

I know he's around when the sky and the ground start in ringing
I know he is near 
By the thunder I hear in advance

His words, his words alone
Are the words that can start my heart singing
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance

He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
And bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

In every way, every day
I need less of myself and more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance
In every way, every day

I need less of myself and more him, more him

Christy Mauro,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",That Old Devil Moon
Christy Mauro,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All
Christy Nockels,"I once was fatherless
A stranger with no hope
Your kindness wakened me
Awakened me, from my sleep

Your love it beckons deeply
A call to come and die
By grace now I will come
And take this life, take Your life

Sin has lost it's power
Death has lost it's sting
From the grave you've risen
Victoriously!

Into marvelous light I'm running
Out of darkness, out of shame
By the cross You are the truth
You are the life, You are the way

My dead heart now is beating
My deepest stains now clean
Your breath fills up my lungs.
Now I'm free, now I'm free!

See the light that I have found
Oh the marvelous light

No better hope for all mankind 
No higher mind, no not one

No one has ever known
This kind of love You've shown

There has never been a greater love 
Than Your son
No, not one
And there will never be a name above
No, not one

Kulangsung jatuh cinta

Atau bolehkah ku sekedar sayang padamu

Chroma Key,"I was half outside and half inside a dream
When I thought I heard your voice on my machine
Sang along had the song almost memorized
Liked the track so I laid back and let it fossilize

I've got all of this on video
It just gets better every episode

America I was blind but now I see
America right there in front of me

Lost my head in my hotel room
When the ground shook
Had to choose between the Bible
And the phone book

You're never home but that's okay
It's so much easier that way
'Cause I can't tell it to your face
In real time anyway

America I was blind but now I see
America right there in front of me

And it makes no sense to me
Unless I see it on TV
So just launch that satellite
And get it right

America I was blind but now I see
America right there in front of me

Chroma Key,"On a beach twenty yards from the road-side
I'm back again, 6:00 A.M., far from sleep
Must be two-ninety blue on the water
It's grey to me, 3 CV is all I see

Green can only hold you in the garden
Too much red will go right to your head
But if it's all the same to you give me back my blue
Other colors fade anyway

I'm Colorblind, three way tragedy
Pantone memory, grey-scale eyes
Maybe I'm paranoid, yeah, that's my problem
You almost have to be when you look like me
Yeah, Yeah

Stopped in the shade of the road-side when the sun rose like a bomb
Tried to read the simple writing but the letters came out wrong
It's all white lines to me, oh, but, things are getting clearer
I can almost read the writing in the mirror

I'm colorblind, a free-way tragedy
Pantone memory with xray eyes
Where did all the color go on my radio?
You almost have to be a satellite to see
Yeah, Yeah",Colorblind

And I can't get him. 
And he's looking at me, and he'll still eat the Dorito. 
He's behind the fucking - I'm gonna fucking kill him.

Apologies she can't accept

Chroma Key,"Sometimes I wanna sleep in the street
But it feels a little funny without you
Down in the basement feeling the pavement
Holding my stomach

and sometimes I can't believe my own feet
So I found another permanent address
Sold the old mattress keeping the changes
Talking to strangers

I knew I could forget you
That's what I'm gonna do
Now I'm staring at a stop sign
Just like the last time

hey you're everything you dreamed you'd be
What a civilized way to be angry
Locked in the attic, starting to panic
Wait, that's me

always it's the same situation
It's got to be somebody's fault
But I never know what to do
So let's say we put the blame on you

standing in a phone booth
Waiting for the punch line
Trying not to call you
Just like the last time

sometimes I wanna sleep in the street
But it feels a little funny without you
Down in the basement feeling the pavement
Holding my stomach in
