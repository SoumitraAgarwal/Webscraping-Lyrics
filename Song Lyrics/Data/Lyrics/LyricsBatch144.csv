Giorgia,"Puoi
Ridere, volare, camminare
Puoi
Essere, cercare, sopravvivere

Puoi
Non fermarti mai
E se è difficile
Fidati di te, fidati di te

Puoi
Correre, sentire, immaginare
Puoi
Crescere, aspettare, ritornare

Puoi
Non stancarti mai
E se è impossibile
Pensami con te e

Non tremare
Se la vita ti fa male no
Non tremare, fidati di te

È più avanti di così
È più vero di così
Se ci credi scopri che
C'è più spazio di così

È più forte di così
È più grande di com'è
E' più sole di così, la strada

Puoi, la strada, puoi
Puoi
Perdere sapere illuminare
Sai
Scegliere sbagliare per rifare poi

Non fermarti mai
E se è difficile
Fidati di te
E non tremare
Se la vita ti fa male, no
Non tremare

Fidati di te
È più avanti di così
È più vero di così
Se ci credi scopri che c'è più spazio di così

È più forte di così
È più grande di com'è
È più sole di così
È più avanti di così
È più vero di così

Se ci credi scopri che
C'è più spazio di così
È più forte di così
È più grande di com'è
È più sole di così, la strada

Puoi, la strada, puoi
La strada
Puoi immaginare tutto 
Il mondo un po' più vero

Con le ali trasparenti 
Che va solo in su
Puoi illuminare la tua vita

Con l'amore che
Ti prende, ti vola, ti tiene su
Puoi immaginare tutto il
Mondo un po' più vero

Con le ali trasparenti che
Va solo in su
Puoi illuminare la tua vita

Con l'amore che
Ti prende, ti vola, ti tiene su
Se ci credi scopri che
C'è più spazio di così
C'è più aria di così
C'è più sole di così
La strada
È più avanti di così
È più vero di così
Tu ci credi scopri che 
C'è più sole di così
La strada
Più avanti di così
Più vero di così",Puoi (Fidati Di Te)
Giorgia,"E se potessi stringerti
Appoggiarmi a te
Stanotte che c'è inverno
Fuori e dentro me
Se ti potessi stringere

Nelle mani se
Potessi raccontarti
Riposarmi in te
Senza segreti
Senza bugie
Senza parole
Te lo direi
Che al mondo esiste un posto
Dove rinchiuderci a giocare
A ridere del mondo
Che non ride mai
E dove esiste un posto
Pieno di aria e di canzoni
Da respirarci dentro
Per non fermarsi mai

E se potessi stringerti 
E ritrovarmi in te
Stanotte senza tempo essere con te
Se ti potessi stringere
Nelle mani se
Potessi raccontarti
Riposarmi in te
Senza segreti
Senza bugie
Senza parole

E se potessi stringerti
Appoggiarti a me
Stanotte che c'è buio
Con gli occhi chiusi",Senza Segreti
Giorgia,"Danza la coscienza
Nella domenica ipnotica
Delle veritÃ  svendute,
Dell'adunanza catodica.

Nebbia di mercanti
Di nuovi traffici e farisei,
Di gendarmi riverenti.
Dentro di te un sole silenzioso.

Picchiano le armi
Nella domenica ipocrita
Delle morti intelligenti,
Nel sangue della legalitÃ .

Batte il cuore, batte a fondo.
Gli occhi non ti si confondono.
Batte quando non Ã¨ spento
Dentro di te il sole silenzioso

Di chi disubbidirÃ .
Lungo la terra di chi
Sempre disubbidirÃ .
Nella giustizia di chi,
Di chi disubbidirÃ . Sole silenzioso.
Quando il futuro Ã¨ con chi
Sempre disubbidirÃ . Sole silenzioso.
La storia fatta di chiâ?¦",Silenzioso Amore

Giorgia,"Uomo nero chi sei
Nelle favole non vinci mai
Uomo nero lo sai
Ne diritti ne doveri per voi

Gli occhi chiusi della gente
Ferma il tempo e si dimentica che
I diversi sono uguali

È facile vedere che
Con le note nelle mani (living in the colours)
Si può gridare libertà

Da solo libera la vita va
Ci vestirà
Nella guerra di colori (living in the colours)
Suoneremo verità

Fin quanto tu colori non hai

Corri come il vento balli puoi
Nuove strade, giovani idee
C'è chi pelle nera vuole, noi
Lo diremo, lo sentiamo

È facile cantare che
Con le note nelle mani (living in the colours)
Suoneremo verità (living in the colours)
Noi siamo uguali siamo vivi noi

E vita sia

Tanto tu colori non hai

Giorgia,"Vorrei, vorrei, vorrei, vorrei
Se guardo intorno se
Se cerco intorno a me
C'è solo voglia di
Scappare via da qui

Mi chiedo solo se
Se esiste un modo se
Possiamo ridere di più
Vivere adesso la mia età

Vorrei vorrei
Io non mi muovo no
No io non scapperò
Quello che sento devo essere
Stringere tutti accanto a me

Vorrei, vorrei, vorrei
Se mi allontano non morirò
È solo questo mio crescere
Anche se urlate non smetterò
Stringermi a me

Vorrei, vorrei, vorrei
Gli amici che non ho che si allontanano
E visi stanchi che mi guardano
Non so se questo è vivere
Se questo è crescere
È diventare come te
Tu che mi ascolti come sei

Vorrei, vorrei, vorrei
Anche se gridi non smetterò
È solo questo mio essere
Figlia di un sogno dove potrò stringerti a me

Giorgia,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is [Live]

Giorgia,"Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day.
Lord, it made me feel so tired.
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind.
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it.
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural woman.
 
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be 
(Want to be)
Close to you. 
You make me feel so alive!
You make me feel, you make me feel,
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman.

You make me feel like a natural natural woman

You make me feel like a natural natural woman",(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman
Giorgia,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Giorgia,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

Giorgia,"The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here

Giorgia,"L'amore poi cos'è, dammi una definizione:
Combinazione chimica o è fisica attrazione, mi sai dire tu cos'è,
Se ti innamorerai sarà un incrocio di emozioni,
Inevitabile, non ci sono spiegazioni e non è chiaro neanche a me

Si dice amore quando si accende che più rovente non c'è,
Sbatterci contro è inevitabile, sta capitando proprio a me,
Si dice amore se tutto prende, ma non ti importa perchè,
Tanto lo sai che è inevitabile ed è successo anche a me, come a te

Inevitabile, anche se ti chiudi dentro, nascondersi non serve,
È questione sai di tempo, ti sorprende prima o poi, prima o poi

Questo è l'amore che fa cambiare in ogni parte di te,
Finirci dentro è inevitabile, sta capitando proprio a me,
Questo è l'amore che fa dannare e uscire fuori di te,
Viverlo in pieno è inevitabile ed è successo anche a me, come a te

E non c'è niente da capire, è una semplice esigenza, forse la risposta è tutta qui,
Se poi scegli di morire, senza opporre resistenza, è perchè tu infondo vuoi così

Si dice amore quando si accende che più rovente non c'è,
Sbatterci contro è inevitabile, sta capitando proprio a me,

Giorgia,"The table's set for 2 but I'm the only one
That's how you left me here with a smoking gun
Thought we were solid wood but we are plastic trees
I swear I hear you laughing cause the joke's on me

Can you lose what you never did have
It's hard to hold there in your hands
Was my assumption running too fast
Did I lose you, did I lose you,
Letting go is the hardest part
Like holding on to a shooting star
Was my assumption running too fast
Did I lose you, did I lose you,

But I saw your colors in a shining light
But it was just a sketch of you in black and white
What kind of crazy spell did you leave me on
It takes some kiss and tell and then you were gone

Che rimane quando sai
Che tutto è perso tutto è rotto ormai

Pregherò

Per desiderarti tanto
Per lasciare ogni rimpianto e no

To make it better change for a weekend

Giorgia,"Sono facile da accontentare
Tutto quello che mi serve è qui
Tra le mani vuote una ventiquattr'ore
Dove tengo me e le cose di valore

Non è facile da sopportare
La morale dice la coscienza sa
E chiudo gli occhi e il mondo fuori per sentire
Come corre l'aria come scorre il mare

La mia stanza è come un palco che si illumina
Un punto rosso nella notte che si sgretola
Il sentimento sale
Come il sangue e l'emozione nelle vene

Sento che ci sei
Dove non so
Nuda è la mia voce
Che ti chiama, che ti ama

Sono facile da conquistare
Credo ancora all'incantesimo
Tra le stelle e Dio e tra le persone
Ma mi manca l'aria come mi manca il mare

La mia stanza è come un palco che si illumina
Un punto rosso nella notte che si sgretola
Il sentimento sale
Come il sangue e l'emozione nelle vene

Sento che ci sei
Dove non so
Nuda è la mia voce
Che ti chiama, che ti ama

Sento che ci sei, che ci sei
Nuda è la mia voce
Che ti chiama, che ti ama

La mia stanza è come un palco che si illumina
Un punto rosso nella notte che si sgretola
Il sentimento sale
Come il sangue e l'emozione nelle vene

Giorgia,"Spero che poi non ce l’avrai con me
Non sono io l’immagine che hai di me
Non vedi, che cerchi
Il controllo sui pensieri e su me
E perdi me

Non importa davvero
Se hai preso tu la parte migliore di me
Ma credevi per davvero
Che sarei stata per te
L’aria la scusa
La lealtà
Purezza illusa e tu di là
Non mi ami
Perché non mi ami
Non mi ami
No tu non mi ami così

Ero un nodo fatto su di te
Quello che so io non lo devo certo a te
La voglia la rabbia
Le tue armi sui pensieri e su me
E perdi me

Non importa davvero
Se hai preso tu la parte migliore di me
Ma credevi per davvero
Che sarei stata per te
L’aria la scusa la lealtà
Purezza illusa tu di là

Non ci sarai
Nei miei anni dentro ai miei discorsi
Sai che solo il tempo
Prende e dà
Spengo le lacrime
Ora è possibile
Ne ho sprecate per te
Non puoi barare con me

Non importa davvero
Se hai preso tu la parte migliore di me
Ma credevi per davvero
Che sarei stata per te
L’aria la scusa la lealtà
Purezza illusa e tu di là

Giorgia,"Oggi vendo tutto
E mi risveglio in un sogno
Cos'è successo alla gente
In questo mondo fottuto

Sempre è sempre
Tutto era tutto
D'accordo d'accordo che
Fosse un altra bugia

Sono una delle tante
Pago sulla mia pelle
Grazie madre mia
Grazie stelle

Le parole qui non servono a nessuno
E lontano dal buio
Giuro ti giuro
Che uno di questi giorni
Uno di questi anni anzi oggi si

Oggi vendo tutto
E mi risveglio in un sogno

Poi mi ricompro tutta la parte del sogno
Dove non ci sei
Dove non ci sei
Perché in un mondo materiale
La vita non si può rifare
E fra milioni di parole
Quello che ci vuole è solo sentimento
E non tormento mai più

Qui fra le mie braccia mai più
Davanti al mio sorriso mai più
Sotto questo sole mai più perché
Oggi vendo tutto anche te

E mi risveglio in un attimo
Com'è cambiata l'America
Non la vedevo da un secolo
Uno di questo giorni
Oh uno di questi anni anzi oggi si

Oggi vendo tutto
E mi risveglio in un sogno

Poi mi riprendo tutta quella parte del sogno
Dove non ci sei
Dove non ci sei
È la vita che ho voluto
Ci devo ancora lavorare lo so lo so
E poi che sono giorni duri
Lo vedo da me
Serve sentimento e non tormento
Solo sentimento

Oggi vendo tutto anche te",Oggi vendo tutto
Giorgia,"Ora che ti guardo
Vedo solo il buono
Che rimane quando sai
Che tutto è perso tutto è rotto ormai

Considerando noi soli
In queste circostanze nuove
Lasciamoci così
Perché un legame sempre resterà

Pregherò
Piangerò
Per desiderarti tanto
Per lasciare ogni rimpianto e no

Non lo so' che farò
Quando avrò finito il tempo
E sarà tardi per l'inverno
Che nel cuore ho
Per te io pregherò.

Tu non hai mai creduto
Che se noi siamo qui
È per cambiare faccia
Per cambiare tutto quello che si può

E mi hai lasciato sola
Senza una parola
Senza fiato e senza peso
Un inferno condiviso mai

Pregherò
Piangerò
Per desiderarti tanto
Per lasciare ogni rimpianto e no

Non lo so' che farò
Quando avrò finito il tempo
E sarà tardi per l'inverno
Che nel cuore ho
Per te io pregherò.

Io non ti aspetto più
Non hai coraggio tu
Come un pugno in faccia adesso sei

Sarà possibile
Tornare a vincere
Contro il disincanto che mi dai
Ma tu come fai

Pregherò
Piangerò
Per desiderarti tanto
Per lasciare ogni rimpianto e no

Non lo so' che farò
Quando avrò finito il tempo
E sarà tardi per l'inverno
Che nel cuore ho
Per te io pregherò.

Per te io pregherò, amore",Pregherò
Giorgia,"Cambia il cielo, cambia la musica
Dell’anima, ma tu resti qui con me
Tra lo stomaco e i pensieri più invisibili
E da li non te ne andrai
La vita cambia idea
Cambia le intenzioni e mai nessuno sa
Come fa

Quando una stella muore
Che brucia ma non vuole
Un bacio se ne va
L’universo se ne accorgerà
Quando una stella muore
Fa male, fa male

Troppe notti sotto agli occhi porto livide
Ho imparato a modo mio
A leccarmi le ferite più invisibili
Perché così che si fa
Ma la vira cambia idea
Cambia le intenzioni e mai nessuno sa
Come fa
Quando una stella muore
Che brucia ma non vuole
Un bacio se ne va
L’universo se ne accorgerà
Quando una stella muore
Fa male,
A metà tra il destino e casa mia
Arriverà la certezza che non è stata colpa mia

Non è stata colpa mia

E l’universo se ne accorgerà
Quando una stella muore
Fa male",Quando una stella muore

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

One look and I had found my future at last

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Giorgio Li Calzi,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

However far it seems (love never ends)

Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I go
I'll never find a better prize (find a better prize)

I see you everyday
I don't have to try
I just close my eyes

Giorgio Moroder,"Did you think your love would last forever?
Did you always have somewhere to go?
Did you tell your lies for entertainment?
Did you ever let your feelings show?
Could you ever tell the truth from fiction?
Did you even let your lovers know?
Did you think that life is an addiction?
And love has to be killed or it may grow
Why must the show go on
After the crowd has gone?
After the battles won
Why must the show go on?
On through the night
On until light
Never in our lives were we together
Nothing real underneath the show
Talk of passion could have been the weather
How could love so wounded die so slow?
Why must the show go on
After the crowd has gone?
After the battles won
Why must the show go on?
Why must the show go on?
After the race is run?
After the victor's song
Why must the show go on?
On through the night
On until light
Why must the show go on?
After the race is run?
After the victor's song
Why must the show go on?
Why must the show go on
After the crowd has gone?
After the battles won
Why must the show go on?

Giorgio Moroder,"Father said to me we gotta have your life run night
Off you got to school where you can learn the rules there right
Be just like your dad lad
Follow in the same tradition
Never go astray and stay an honest lovin' son.

Molded I was folded I was preform-packed
Son of my father
Commanded I was branded in a plastic vac'
Surrounded and confounded by statistic facts.

Tried to keep me in but jumped out of my skin in time
I saw through the lies and read the alibi signs
So I left my home I'm really on my own at last
Left the trodden path and separated from the past.

Son of my father
Changing rearranging into someone new
Son of my father
Collecting and selecting independent views
Knowing and I'm showing that a change is due.

My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be

Thank God man I had the block

You young fucks got the game all wrong
This is my life man this ain't no song
You ain't livin' your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house
In that tight-ass room, pullin' the cars out
And the mirror pointin' at your reflection, killing yourself
You American Pie, stop feeling yourself
Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself
Stop being a server, get a meal yourself
Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of your gats

Giorgio Moroder,"As the night is leaving silently retreating down an empty hall
Suddenly a stirring finally recurring where I let it fall
Following the wanderings of a dream a dream that keeps my soul alive
Believing in an open sky believing in a love

Dancing with a stranger careless of the danger there within his smile
While the dew was forming breathing in the morning like a sleeping child
If the memory of the light should fade horizons reaching cold and blue
Until your heart is free to fly then I will keep the sun for you
Until you touch the open sky then I will keep the sun for you
Until we never say goodby then I will keep the sun for you",The Chase [DJ Werner Mix]

To let your heart dance on my avenues
(Oh, I'm) Tempted! It's physically cruel
Watching you angels put on your red dancing shoes
Watching you angels put on your red dancing shoes
I'm tempted!",Tempted
Giorgio Moroder,"I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in

It is always nice to see you
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
I'm pretending not to see them
Instead, I pour the milk

Everybody's welcome
Come on, come on in
Sit yourself down
The funnies never end
Love is the drug
That makes you want to drink
Till the morning after, oh

I open up the paper
There's a story of an actor
Who had died while he was drinking
It was no one I had heard of
And I'm turning to the horoscope
Looking for the funnies
When I'm feeling someone watching me
And so I raise my head",Tom's Diner
Giorgio Moroder,"I keep dancing in my dreams
Here away into your arms
Flying high like you wouldn't believe
Wishing on weightless heart

I got carried away on an endless dream
Probably took you way too far
When the glitter falls into the light
I'll be dancing like a wildstar

Oooh, oooh, oooh
Glitter falls into the light
And I'll be dancing like a wildstar

Light up, light up, light up the sky
Light up, light up, light up the sky

Where the mountains high
Seem to kiss the sky
Someone is out yonder, o'er the hills
Waiting patiently, Waiting just for me
 
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above

I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair

Giovanni,"Aquarius, was born the night

You seduced me, I can never ever run

'Cause I, can only lose
When I'm, Aquarius

To make it all succeed, can hear me call?

It calls your name, and you listen
It steals your soul, and your hunger and your lust

It's dragging you, it's killing me (it's killing me, it's killing me)

Giovanni,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

I will be there
And everywhere

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get

E vorrei trovare un senso alle parole
Per capire in questo mondo come vivere lontano

Parlami di te
Come non fossi stato mai lontano
E tornerò da te con questo cielo in mano

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Giovanni Maradi,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?

Girlicious,"Memories like the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me would we, oh could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter, oh we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were, the way we were

See I would not replace or erase all our memories
Lessons given to us we learned unselfishly
So take this moment, take an extra breath
With respect for our time, can't rewind what's just meant to be

But now we gotta move on, gotta stay strong
Celebrating us all night long
No regrets, don't forget that our time together was truly beautiful
Theses memories will live forever

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter that we will remember
Whenever we remember the way we were

We text as we talk
We're running as we walk
Cause we surf our little souls away
We smoke as we choke
As we sink another coke
And we grin when it blows our mind
We skate as we date
As we slowly suffocate
We're running, we're running, we're running out of time

[Chorus]
My life got cold
It happened many years ago
When summer slipped away
So chill now whoa
We've gotten many years to go
So take it day by day
And long ago I lost my soul
To some forgotten dream
But how was I supposed to know
It wasn't what it seamed
And even though the last to know
Has left me on the floor
I don't believe in Romeo's and heroes anymore

We spin as we grin
Cause we're happy to pretend
Everything's gonna be OK
We shake as we wake
Never give until we take
And we hate it when we have to pay
We flirt while we work
To forget about the hurt
And the trash that we left behind
We sink as we swim
The ice is wearing thin
We're running we're running we're running out of time

Girls Aloud,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa

I feel so calm and I think about an eating ground (we're today)

Girls in Hawaii,"It's always strange the way I feel
When I'm looking back on things
We've been lucky maybe who knows
Or have we just made some good choices

Now joking in a landscape field
Just sleeping quietly below trees
Are we close to the end of dreams
We were blinded by the scene

I was quiet fine
Lost and wasting my time
Asleep just by your side
And I'm so lighter
My mind was close to get high 
So far away

The sun was disappearing fast
I was cold, laid on the grass
Awake by night, sad was my mind
My dreams are short when they are fine

I was quiet fine
Lost and wasting my time
Asleep just by your side
And I'm so lighter
My mind was close to get high 
So far away

Don't go away from me
Don't go away from here
I had not enough
And something is easy

I want a sunshine on my days
To clear and burn the trash I said

Gisselle,"Yo sé que este amor va conmigo hasta mi último día
Amar de esta forma total es amar de por vida
Ni el agua de los siete mares apaga este fuego
No puedo evitar entregarme a este ardiente deseo

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas

Cierro los ojos pensando si no te tuviera
No habría ni luna ni noches si yo te perdiera
Si acaso naciera otra vez y tuviera esa suerte
Yo solo estaría por ti, por volver a quererte

Es algo más fuerte que yo que aún contra mi voluntad
Me lleva y me trae, me enciende y me quema
Me obliga a pedir siempre más

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor
No quiero soltar las cadenas
Que envuelves en mi corazón

Atada de pies y de manos volviéndome loca por ti
Tocando la cima del cielo deseando tus besos en mí
Sin límite, sin condición, sin causa, sin una razón
Pudiendo elegir libremente entre tantas cosas
Me aferro a tu amor, oh, oh, oh, atada a tu amor

Atada de pies y de manos me tienes rendida de amor

La ilusión que un día se fue
Una triste soledad en mí
Y tu recuerdo sigue aquí

La pasión que ya no está
Un silencio sin final
La esperanza de volver a ti
A tener tu cuerpo junto a mí

Soñando que tu amor
Un día vendrá
Por siempre tu recuerdo

Y tu mirar
Ahora tú decides regresar
Porque no puedes olvidar
Por eso júrame

Que no es un sueño
Estar de nuevo en ti
Que fue un infierno
No volverte a ver

Que fue un abismo eterno estar
Sin ti mi vida, júrame

Que para siempre regresaste a mí
Que sigue viva la ilusión de ayer
Aún nos queda tanto por vivir, júrame

Que del pasado solo quedan las heridas
Y que la copa de tu amor ya está vacía

No te das cuenta que detrás de tu amargura
Aún palpita la ternura de un gran amor

Voy a enamorarte
Voy a demostrarte
Que en tu herido corazón
A pesar del desengaño
Del dolor de iqueños años
Sigue vivo en ti el amor

Voy a enamorarte
Voy a conquistarte

Y a pesar del cruel pasado
Estarás aquí a mi lado

Partirse para amar a dos al mismo tiempo
Puede acaso la razón
Ponerse y mandar sobre los sentimientos

Cómo es que al mirar tus ojos
En este cada latido
Cómo es que al sentir su piel
Me muero de ganas por estar contigo

Puede acaso la distancia hacer
Que te evapore de mi pensamiento
Puede acaso la conciencia
Arrancar de raíz esto que llevo dentro

Encontré enamorarme
Pero a ti yo no te olvido
Tanto que al sentir su piel
Me muero de ganas por estar contigo

Quien me puede explicar
Como se puede amar a dos al mismo tiempo
Como puedes tocar
El infierno y el cielo en el mismo momento

Como puedo seguir
Escondiendo en mi pecho este secreto
Como puedo enfrentar
Mi verdad ante el mundo si no es lo correcto

Cómo puedo evitar
Que cuando estoy con él llegue a mí tu recuerdo
Cuántas veces tu nombre

Acaricia mi mente y lo oculta en silencio
Cómo se puede amar a dos
Al mismo tiempo, al mismo tiempo

Puedo estar entre tus brazos
Y sentir su cuerpo casi sin quererlo
Puedo ahogarme entre sus labios
Y sentir la llama dulce de tus besos

Yo no puedo estar sin ti
Mas sin él tampoco vivo
Cómo puedo amar así
Si el verdadero amor jamás es compartido

Quién me puede explicar
Cómo se puede amar a dos al mismo tiempo
Cómo puedes tocar

El infierno y el cielo en el mismo momento
Cómo puedo seguir
Escondiendo en mi pecho este secreto

Cómo puedo enfrentar
Mi verdad ante el mundo si no es lo correcto
Como puedo evitar
Que cuando estoy con él llegue a mi tu recuerdo

Cuántas veces tu nombre
Acaricia mi mente y lo oculta en silencio

Preguntándonos que nos paso discutiendo
Por deportes como siempre inventándonos

Un nuevo error otro día que se muere
Prometiendo que mañana nos irá mejor
La esperanza se refugia entre los sueños pero
Acaba cuando nace el sol

Y volvemos a este cirulo vicioso que desgasta
Nuestras ganas de sentir por el miedo de lanzarnos
A vivir no queda nada lo fue ya no será para

Que seguir buscando donde no hay nada que hallar
No queda nada, nada no confundas el ayer con el mañana
Porque no es lo mismo el humo que la llama

No hay manera de forzar un sentimiento
No te aferres en dar marcha atrás, hay heridas que se
Sanan con el tiempo y hay mentiras que no
Cubren la verdad

Terminemos este cirulo vicioso que desgasta
Nuestras ganas de sentir por el miedo de lanzarnos
A vivir no queda nada lo fue ya no será para

Que seguir buscando donde no hay nada que hallar
No queda nada, nada no confundas el ayer con el mañana
Porque no es lo mismo el humo que la llama

No queda nadita de nada te quiero
Lejo, lejo, lejo, lejo, no queda nada
(No, no, no)
No queda nada ya no
(Oh, uh)

No queda nada
(No queda no queda)
No queda ya
(Nada de nada)
Mira no te confundas que aquí no queda ni el humito

No queda nada lo fue ya no será para que seguir
Buscando donde no hay nada que hallar no queda

Que nada es lo que parece

Y se hacen las noches eternas a solas y finges de día
Con tu rol de señora

De qué nos vale que el mundo
Se crea que somos dichosas
De qué nos vale si el alma nos llora
De qué nos vale ser esa pareja que todos celebran

De qué nos vale si son apariencias
De qué nos vale que pidan perdón si cuando
Perdonas después te traicíonan
De qué nos vale

Decides dejarlo y entonces se asusta
Promete arreglarse, te pide disculpas
Y tu que lo amas le crees como siempre
Bajas la guardia y el vuelve a ofenderte

De qué nos vale que el mundo
Se crea que somos dichosas
De qué nos vale si el alma nos llora

Que te amo demasiado y lo debo admitir
Que no vuelvo a enamorarme y de eso estas seguro

Y te tengo que informar que estas equivocado
Hace tiempo que mi alma te ha dejado huir

Ya soy libre, libre de tus cadenas
Libre y enhorabuena porque sobreviví
Ya soy libre, libre y me siento nueva
Y no hay quién me detenga

Porque gracias a ti ya soy libre

No sé qué te hace pensar que puedo ser tan débil
Debe ser que tu autoestima anda de bajón
Deja ya de preocuparte por lo que me pase
Créeme que ahora sin ti me va mucho mejor

Chao y que te vaya bien te veo en otra vida
Porque en esta ya no quiero ni por un error

Que yo no tropiezo con la misma piedra
Busca quien te cuide y quien te consienta
Y si no lo encuentras pídele a tu abuela

Busca quien te quiera, busca quien te atienda

Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
Sunday is gloomy on shadows, I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you

Every lovely flower,

Hides its light inside of shame.

I cannot reap what you have sown 
Beneath this blanket of loose soil,
Wrapped around my mortal coil.

Well a stem is not a rose,
But that's how my garden grows.
I can't see the forest for the trees, 
The stinking poison for disease 
Now it's all shot to hell and back again.
I seek redemption for the 
Same old sins and I fall on my knees,
And I pray that all the poppies they 
They will just fade away. 
But fields of poppies they remain.
That's how they found me last time, dead

I guess I'll just tuck myself away tonight 
You know its been one of those days. 

Every pretty flower,
Every lovely flower, 
Every deadly flower, 
Hides its light inside of shame.

I do not know why you don't know,
I cannot reap what you have sown,
Beneath this blanket of loose soil,
Wrapped around my mortal coil. 

Irises lay in spring mud, 
Where lovers drown each other's sorrows,
Where lovers dream about tomorrows. 
As for me I drown another kind as 
Sadness runs course through my veins. 
Posie wreaths they crown me. 
My heart, My heart 
I should just fade away, fade away 
Like a flower",Flowers
Gitte Hænning,"She laughed in my face, told me good-bye
Said ""Don't think about it, you can go crazy
Anything can happen, anything can end
Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me""

[Chorus]
She's a woman in love
And he's gonna break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well alright, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman
You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

[Chorus]

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me
And say she was lonely
I don't understand the world today
I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything she threw it all away
On nothin'
She's a woman in love","Die Frau, Die Dich Liebt"

You just got to know I sleep alone.
You like nothin' better, to hear me plead with you.
You like nothin' better, to know I'm still your fool.

I've been wondering why, wondering why...
You like to see me cry.
Don't, DON'T tear me down.
Don't, DON'T tear me down.
You said nothin' lasts forever.
You were the only one I like to hold.
But now you turn to ice, your touch is cold.
Now all you like to do is manipulate.

Giuffria,"So we meet again and I just pretend to pass you on by.
Your hand is on my switch, like a razor to my wrist.
Now I realize...
You got a hold on me.
You turn me on.
You turn me on.
Like a fever in my heart, a fire I can't stop.
You burn me straight thru.
This twist of foolish fate, how love can turn to hate.
Still I have got to have you.
You got a hold on me.
You turn me on.

Giuffria,"Yeah!
There'll be no escape, no turning back, All the broken promises, straight from the pack,
The angry flames, that burn too high, You dare to run, when there's nowhere to hide.
You've gone too far, into the raven's den You jumped the gun, and tried to defend 

The ruthless rain, that falls so hard It's there to remind you, you won't get too far.
There'll be no escape, no way out for you
Now there's no turning back, when the damage is through
Now it's all for one, and one for them all. This time they talk, still you won't fall

Choosing your friends, like champagne on ice. You're done with the vultures, and you pay the price
And now you believe, in all that you read, With your face on the cover of a magazine
Faith has failed you, you're losing control, Now you're hard like a rock, that forgot how to roll
There'll be no escape, no way out for you

Now there's no turning back, when the damage is through
Oh and there'll be no escape, no way out for you
There'll be no turning back, when the damage is through, No
No escape, no way out. No escape, no way out, oh

Were gonna hit the town

Giusy Ferreri,"Poco, schiva, quando la passione è positiva 
Forse partirei 
Posso 
Forse penso a lei e resto 
Non lo so 

Mento quando dico di risolvere i problemi 
Quando tutto ciò che faccio è aspettare 
Sbagli quando pensi che il silenzio faccia bene 
Tu mi aspetti ma il silenzio mi distrae 

Forse aver paura, è ridicolo 
Non lo so 
E fanno meglio quelli che poi fingono 
Non lo so 

Mmm mmm Forse il dubbio mi conviene 
Oh oh Forse un alibi fa bene

Oh oh Lasciami da parte un po' di tempo e poi da sola capirò 
Non lo so 

Difficile trovare teste come le tue 
È facile sbagliare come quando ne hai due 
Sento solamente freddo perdo quota e mi lamento 
Prendo quota e prendo tempo e ora

Giusy Ferreri,"E mi dici che oramai è finito, questo è falso
E che non ti ho mai realmente amato, questo è brutto
Perché non ti basta la violenza
Di uno sguardo trascorso, ormai vuoi di più
Non si ferma, il tuo odio nascosto
 
Ah stai fermo lì e ti guardo, poi ti perdo
Ah e in ogni frase in ogni attesa lieve
Dentro e fuori il mondo, sarò lì
 
E mi dici che sarai mio amico, non ci credo
Che mi chiamerai se sarai solo, ora rido
 
Perché non ti basta questa stanza
Che si riempie di vuoto
Sarà sofferenza o che cosa?
Un dolore da poco
 
Ah stai fermo lì e ti parlo, poi ti perdo
Ah e in ogni frase in ogni attesa lieve
Dentro e fuori il mondo sarò lì
Sarò lì
(Sarò lì)
 
E dormirai mentre ti ascolterò
Sorriderai ma non ci crederò
Maledirai ciò che sono e sarò
Me lo dirai ma dimenticherò

Giusy Ferreri,"Trattengo il respiro
Ma conto fino a sette
Perché all’improvviso tu irrompi e mi baci
Ho il sale sulle labbra
Non è acqua di mare
Sorridere fa bene, rimpiangere fa male
Dopo tutti questi anni che ho passato insieme a te,
Ho capito che non posso allontanarmi perché,
E nel momento in cui vado avanti
Lascio dietro me i tuoi occhi spenti
È l’amore a possedere il bene dunque tu possiedi me
E io te, e io te.

Disegno a parole
Il mondo che ho dentro
La vita risponde ad ogni quesito
Lontani da sempre
Dai luoghi comuni
Inutili come sassi i nostri rancori

Ho capito che non posso allontanarmi perché,
E nel momento in cui guardo avanti
Lascio dietro me mille ricordi
È l’amore a possedere il bene dunque io possiedo te

Giusy Ferreri,"Ti porto a cena con me
Il tuo passato non è invitato
Lascia a casa le pene
Se me lo sono un po’ meritato
Ti porto a cena perché
Vorrei che tu mi togliessi il fiato
Riaverlo indietro da te
Come se fosse il mio compleanno
Il mio regalo

Avrei voluto scriverti una lettera
Anche se ormai si usa poco
Se fosse contagiosa la felicità
Adesso è fuori moda

Vorrei che tra le righe tu capissi che
Che nonostante il mio sorriso
Non tutto è stato semplice, ed anche se
Nascondo il peggio è perché il meglio è andato via con te

Ti porto a cena con me
Ho un conto aperto con il passato
Che pagherò io perché
Il tuo futuro non sia un inganno
Ti porto a cena perché

È perché il meglio è andato via con te

Sai non importa il trucco, la bellezza è in testa

Io non so dove sono, e là fuori com’è 
Non ho mai visto il mare dietro la tua casa 
E le mille stazioni e I maglioni e I caffè 
Di quel viaggio inatteso che ti ha portata qui 

Quante volte hai tremato dentro le tue battaglie 
Raccogliendo per strada pezzi di coraggio 
E quanti anni hai perduto dietro le meraviglie 
Tu che sai che non c’è una sola verità 

Ma da qui si può sentire 
Il tuo battito profondo 
Il primissimo respiro 
Che dà forma all’universo 
L’invisibile bellezza 

Immaginami a casa un giorno che ha piovuto 
Bagnata di risate e ancora senza fiato 
Un ramo che fiorisce in mezzo a questo niente 
La fine di ogni inverno oppure solo quando vuoi 

Immaginami il nome del più grande amore 
In faccia a chi ha paura e non ci crede più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò sei tu 

Era sopra una spiaggia o in un vecchio cortile 
Quando la prima volta forse mi hai inventata 
Ero io quel pensiero che ti ha reso immortale 
Oltre le tue paure oltre le bugie 

E da qui si può sentire 
Il tuo battito profondo 
Il rumore dei tuoi sogni 
Nelle nostre notti insieme 
L’impossibile carezza 

Immaginami a casa un giorno che ha piovuto 
Bagnata di risate e ancora senza fiato 
Un ramo che fiorisce in mezzo a questo niente 
La fine di ogni inverno oppure solo quando vuoi 

Immaginami pronta per disubbidire 
Per centomila volte ma non farlo più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò sei tu 

Ma tu ci pensi mai, dov’è la differenza 
Tra quello che hai voluto ed una coincidenza? 
È quella tentazione di provare ancora a vivere
È solo amore 
È solo amore 

Se tutto l’infinito entra in una mano 
E non abbiamo scelto di essere qualcuno 
Immaginami un punto sopra un foglio bianco 
Che aspetta le parole che domani troverò 
Nell’aria gelida di un’alba prima di partire 
Nell'attimo che ti assomiglierò di più 
Immaginami un posto dove ritornare 
E il posto dove tornerò 
E il posto dove tornerò 
E il posto dove nascerò 
Sei tu 

Io non so dove sono 
E là fuori com’è",Immaginami

Give Up the Ghost,"I ran through 
Storm stained city streets 
Paved with pain 
To bring these roses to you 
And with sore throat insecurity 
You pulled the thorns 
From my bleeding side 
There were winter days 
Spent in,sulking, side 
Try to heat cold sheets 
Hide allergy eyes

I'm now hanging out with destiny 
And begging it to get the best of me 
What else can I do? 
Why do you read me 
Like no one else? 
Used to live headaches 
Now they're somewhere else

We are handguns, angel, 
Waiting to explode
We've lived cold lives 
But now we know 
The sun may hide 
But the night is always there 
So don't anticipate

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

You've gotta change your style

Why don't you tell me

Show me how you feel
Together we can work it out

Meet me halfway

C'mon, c'mon, what you say?

Just give a minute
If you got a change of heart
Don't use me, let me go
Don't take my love for granted
If you want me let it show

'Cause I would give up everything
To prove my love for you
But should I have to pay that price
If you love me too

Why don't you meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
Show me some compassion
C'mon, c'mon, what do you say?

Oh, meet me in the middle

Meet me in the middle baby
Yeah, yeah

Take it and give it
That'll be willing
Open up your heart and your mind

Whenever there a problem
I know that we can solve them
If we go put our love on the line

Hey, why don't you meet me in the middle
Oh, halfway
In the middle
Baby, what do you say?

Why don't you meet me in the middle
Meet me halfway
The word today is compromise

Gladys Knight,"I was talking to my girlfriend just the other day
I was not a bit surprised at what she had to say
On the subject of love we both were disillusioned
All day long we tried to find some kind of a solution

She said, ""I'm tired of all that cheatin' and lyin'
Men won't change so I'm just gonna give up tryin'""
I said, ""I feel the same way, too, but I
Can't give up so I don't know what to do""

I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
What can you do about 'em?
I tell you, men
Can't live with 'em but you can't live without 'em
I say we got a problem (oh, whoa)

Said, I know
I said we oughta tell them about their evil ways
I know they'll get defensive then turn around and say
""We're not alone out here 'cause women do it, too""
I said, ""two wrongs don't make it right, they pay the price like you do""

She said, ""uh-huh, I'm tired of all this cheatin' and lyin'
Men won't change so I'm just gonna give up tryin'""

I hope that there's a man somewhere who knows that love's a treasure
But the only ones I've met so far has used this love for pleasure
They don't make commitments, they say ""come deal with me""

Made you that promise
For better or worse I said I'd
Stand by your side

Woman who loves you
We're sittin' here falling apart
All through your ins and outs
Your fears and all your doubts
And God knows there's been doubts
But we've given you a home, and you're just
Throwing it away baby

Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be 
Everybody searching for a hero 
People need someone to look up to 
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs 
A lonely place to be 
So I learned to depend on me 

[Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows 
If I fail, if I succeed 
At least I'll live as I believe 
No matter what they take from me 
They can't take away my dignity 
Because the greatest love of all 
Is happening to me 
I found the greatest love of all 
Inside of me 
The greatest love of all 
Is easy to achieve 
Learning to love yourself 
It is the greatest love of all 

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way 
Show them all the beauty they possess inside 
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Grandma's hands Used to ache sometimes and swell 
Grandma's hands Used to lift her face and tell her 
She'd say ""Baby, Grandma understands. 
That you really love that man. 
Put yourself in Jesus' hands.""

Couldn't wait till Sunday morning (oh baby don't you run so fast)
Cooking up that fried chicken,
Smelling up the whole house

Family is a gift of god,
With this song I'd like to pay harness 
To one of it's members
Over the years her importance has been diminished
Her image tarnished, but to me she'll always be a rare jewel
I've heard her called by many loving nicknames
Nana, Mimi, Mamaw, Big Mama, Poppi
But unlike millions of others, I simply call her Grandma

Ain't nothing like grandma's hands 

Let me tell you this

Grandma's hands Used to hand me piece of candy 
Grandma's hands Picked me up each time I fell 
Grandma's hands Boy, they really came in handy 
She'd say ""Baby, don't you whip that boy ! 
What you want to spank him for? 
He didn't drop no apple core !"" 
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for…Grandma's Hands

Gladys Knight,"Tell me what's on ya mind and, baby, don't try to lie
'Cause your lips say this but your heart does that, oh oh
Well, maybe we're just wasting time, trying to pretend we're doing fine
But it's just a game trying to mend that patch

Something that fell apart sometime ago
Both of us know the truth, yeah, still a part of me can't let go
But I'm tired of been played, so where do we go from here
I expected more from you, baby, then what you could return

You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie

For the things that I've heard, I guess they say we're absurd
Until you showed yourself to be someone else, oh yeah
Don't wanna leave feeling like I do
'Cause I've got things that I must say to you, baby

The trust I had for you before, just left and it ain't coming back no more
By the way that was me driving next to your car
I saw her kissing you and you kissed her right back
And there's much more than friendship when you're kissing like that

You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya
I say you lie, I said, I say you lie

You lied about meeting me every minute of the day
You lied when you were kissing me and more than that I wanna say
You lied to our Heavenly Father, when you made your vows
I'll get over it 'cause I'm through with you, I'm gonna make it somehow

You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya

You said you're sorry and she's just a friend
But I say you lie so don't try to pretend
But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried

You said you're sorry and she's just a friend

But you said we'd work it out but you never even tried
You said she meant nothing to ya

Gladys Knight,"Why do I feel like my heart gets broken
Whenever I surrender my emotions
I thought that I could tell you how I feel
Whether good or bad, when I'm happy or sad

Yeah, we had ?em rollin in the aisles
We got it right once, didn't we
We had our shot and missed it by a mile

Forget the bitter end
Can you remember when

We sang, we laughed
They all watched us dance
They circled around us
And toasted to forever
We played to win
We never gave in
And we threw it all away
Like your rose bouquet

Passion flows like a long white gown
But it ain't easy to keep your love alive
We hoped each other would come around
We'll use the lessons for better luck next time

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

And other arms may hold a thrill,
But please, do nothing till you hear it from me--

Gladys Knight,"I know that we both talked it over
And said it's best to forget
And we'll leave all our memories behind us
It's better ended and yet

So sad the song of
Of two empty lives
When that moment of truth
Suddenly arrives

And so sad the song
Of what might have been
You see a lifetime of dreams
Scattered in the wind

Together
We belong together
Never was that one lovely word
Easier to say

And so sad the song
Of just remembering when
Knowing the love of your life
Will never come again

So sad the song
That says goodbye

We belong together
And I'll love you forever

And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine","Begin the beguine, song (from ""Jubilee"")"

I ain't nothing but tired 
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself

You can't start a fire without a spark

There's something happening somewhere 
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire without a spark 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 

You sit around getting older 
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me 
I'll shake this world off my shoulders 
Come on baby this laugh's on me 

Stay on the streets of this town 
And they'll be carving you up alright 
They say you gotta stay hungry 
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight 
I'm dying for some action 
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book 
I need a love reaction 
Come on now baby gimme just one look 

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart

Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart

Gladys Swarthout,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Told me so well you knew

Oh, these years of being all alone.
The disconnected telephones.
The pictures of the friends I never see.
The violence in their written words.
Silent tears are never heard.

The needle made me dream of you and me.

[Chorus]

And this is one time. Such a sad time.
Scream out to the world. I want to scream

Some people tell me talk is cheap.
It's actions that can only speak.
Keep moving. Don't slow down. Don't fall behind.
Don't try and hold your breath.
You'll only drown among the sunken ships.
Don't know what to do? Don't head into this blind.

[Chorus]

This is something you've never known.
Why must I always suffer in silence?
I want to scream out to the world.
I want to scream out to the world.
Scream out to the world. Scream out",Suffer in Silence

Look at me - I'm watching worlds crumble
Look at me - I'm making walls tumble
Take my hand, oh, Lord; it's all I've got
Look at me - I'm watching worlds crumble
With their hearts, they ask me to stay
One life, one voice, calling me

You know it's all I can do",(Watching) Worlds Crumble

Just like a hunter stalks the hunted
In a jungle of lust. It's true

I know that the ""game"" is you.
You keep me running, but I'm still coming.

Since the first star was shining and the moon had its birth
But as with the shadows
Of lonely trees
We are in bondage
But our hearts are still free

Oh, are we never to learn?

Love gives life and life is love...

Still Diamond Sun has to burn
Oh, are we never to learn
Still Diamond Sun has to burn

Someday the sun will shine
And you shall be free
And bless our children as they're put to the test

Of a nation's unrest

My ears are burning
It's been a long, hard day
Telephone rings
I still got nothing to say
Considerations tossed
Out the window
I feel a little bit wired
The rules say anything goes
But I don't want to play
You said I could walk away
Take me back to where
My life burns
I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart
And a life on the run
Took a long walk
I went down through the backstreets
I heard the city scream
Reminds me of the time
I run wicked and free
Now, here I stand all alone
But I'm back to where

One home

Fear disappears

And so I wait in silence
Wait for a star to fall
I'll fly with the angels
As they carry me home

To travel the distant roads
So far from my homeland
So far from my shores

Lead me home to my town
Tell me when that breeze is blowin'

There's a love that just bleeds in my heart
In my childhood days, we went our different ways
But you knew that we'd never part

Now I'm all alone
And your calling me home
You knew our love could never die
And though my roaming eyes always lead me astray
Well I'm coming back home

So when I think of you scotia
There's a magic that fills the air

Glass Tiger,"I could never understand the meaning of our lives
Just at the moment when we let it slip away
Turning back the pages like a chapter
In a book filled with pain
Shadowed by a darkened sky - my eyes
Just let you pass me by forever
Lost forever all alone
Taken where the lonely go to places
They can never call their own
You're never home
I'm falling, falling, falling
But a light shines from above
I'm captured by the moment
Rescued by the arms of love
Darling, darling, darling
It's you I'm dreaming of
Take me where that light shines
I'll be rescued by the arms of love
Close your eyes; your mind will see
That life is still a mystery
A hidden game of cheating and pretend
Leave your heart with shallow friends
They'll turn around and hurt you in the end
It never mends
Why do I keep holding on forever?
A thousand tears I'm drowning in this river
I want this love
I need this love",Rescued (By the Arms of Love)

It will blow your mind

And you will come around anyway
The rhythm of your love will make you bleed
The rhythm of your love is what I need
The rhythm of your love is a golden crown
The rhythm of your love comes a tumbling down
So love takes its toll
A dream you never had
Now you're moving slow

See them smile it's so sad
Oh! You gotta make up your mind
Before they steal your heart away

Up or down?

It's a young man's time
And time won't wait
Oh! Just give me your love

Silenced by the lust of your plans
Caught up in the hatred of man
A darker side will persecute me
And God help you if I'm all you need
So just give me your love (Give me your love)
Give me your hate (Give me your hate)
It's a young man's time

Over and over
Her shadow falls over me

It's chance that brings the Rory's to this foreign land

No one ever builds a wall

Bouncin' off the walls in a wrong direction
Pick it up and turn it 'round, moving at the speed of sound

Please be there when I am coming down
But don't try to catch me

can you feel my struggle?
emotions held in since childhood

walked on, abused, refused...

the consequences of love
feeling so low
one with the floor
every now and then it comes and goes
feeling this high
up in the sky
oh how i've waited to feel adored
so much has changed since then
this inside is still tainted
slowly getting over it
at times i feel so untouchable
sometimes the smallest things bring me down
depression sometimes kills the best of them
so let me use you to forget about the past
and ill do it like that because you said i was the very best
how do my hands feel?
can you feel my pain?

The clock is ticking, damn can you wait? 
Man, will he come back and save the day? 
Fly across the earth, put things in reverse 
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse 
Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst 
I ain't have enough patients, but I needed a nurse 
Got to come by my head let, see if my head ache 
Then get my head straight 
Then give my head great 
Every time I popped up like the VCR 
I took your breath away 
Then we performed CPR 
With all the cars, the clothes, the lights, the boats 
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats 
In the penthouse position, 
With penthouse bitches, 
See I pimped my crib, so I must exhibit 
Shit, these last years been a haze like Issac 
So I close my eyes 
Tighter than Asian eyes 
Get realized 
I got the same wings angels fly 
With Louie Vuitton feathers, now that some fly shit

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing,
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes them happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
Do you know that man makes money to buy from other man?

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing,

He's lost in bitterness
He's lost, lost somewhere in this, in loneliness","It's a Man's, Man's Man's World [Glee Cast Version] [Version]"

No answer on the telephone

I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone

You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown

This here's a tale for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down 'cause you're over zealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous

Okay smartie, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter

Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served, and you're stone cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants

A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'
Said she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move

Uh, hey, ya, uh, uh, hey, ya
Just bust a move
Uh, hey, uh, ya, uh, hey, ya, uh, uh

You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces

From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope

Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
And then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row

She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello
Come sit next to me, you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next, hey bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
Just bust a move
If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it

In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""no way""

Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money, and you got no car
Then you got no woman, and there you are

Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Looking for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man

So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

If you want it, you got it
If you want it, baby, you got it
Just bust a move
If you want it, you got it

In five days from now he's gonna marry

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting

So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And then you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked

Reception's jumpin, bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl, and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upset.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack! You'll take the lead.",Jingle Bells
Glee,"Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one more wish to make
A special one for you

Merry Christmas Darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams,
I'm Christmas-ing with you.

Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you

The lights on my tree
I wish you could see
I wish it every day
The logs on the fire
Fill me with desire
To see you and to say

That I wish you a merry Christmas
Happy New Year, too
I've just one wish
On this Christmas Eve
I wish I were with you
I wish I were with you",Merry Christmas Darling
Glee,"It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
And everyone telling you,
""Be of good cheer,""
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

There'll be parties for hosting,
Marshmallows for toasting and
Caroling out in the snow.
There'll be scary ghost stories and
Tales of the glories of Christmases
Long, long ago.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing,
When loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year",The Most Wonderful Day of the Year

Glee,"O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth

The thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel's voices
O' night divine
O' night when Christ was born
O' night divine
O' night,
O' night divine

O' Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Oh
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt His worth

The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel's voices
