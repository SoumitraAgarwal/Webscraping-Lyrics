Shonen Knife,"I got the role with difficulty.
It's an unnatural dead body.
During the scene I'm not allowed to move.
It's the role that brings 
Opportunity to the story.
Wet clothes, it's strange.

I want to be a superstar. 

The next role I got was a taxi driver in town.
Who carries a leading lady.
I spoke my part, ""Where shall I take you?""
Wearing a taxi driver's costume and.
I became the role.

I want to be a superstar.",Superstar

Weather man says good news go on out and catch a tan
So why am I still shivering
I just don't understand
Rainbow in the sky at noon
I'm dark side of the moon
And in my world the trees are bare
A hint of snow is in the air

And though this ice has got me slippin', slippin', slippen'
Chills since you been gone has got me trippen trippen

[Chorus]

(cold summer, cold cold summer)

Write your name across my window pain
But the frost covers it up again
When you were by my side we were burning up in winter time
But the flame's gone out now since you've went away

[Chorus]

Rainbow in the sky at noon
I'm dark side of the moon
And in my world the trees are bare
A hint of snow is in the air

Can't do this without you (cold cold summer)
I'm frozen up
(Cold cold summer)
Looking outside there's nothing but stormy weather (cold cold summer)",Cold Cold Summer
Shontelle,"Yeah
Listen carefully
Listen to these words

Baby take a minute let me sit you down
Been waiting for the time and the time is now
I think you should decide where you wanna be
Running in the streets or living here with me
Baby take a step back and look around
Gonna run yourself like you do the ground
You're not invincible and the fact is
Nothing's guaranteed but the darn taxes?

[Chorus]
Control your pebble before he turn to stone
Boy you better listen for you're all alone
When the money's spent and all your friends are gone
Then you're gonna realize, you're only flesh and bone (flesh and bone)
Then you're gonna realize, you're only flesh and bone

You know

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
Is there any hope that you could ever be
More than just a fish in the sea
Cause baby after all if you get cut you're gonna bleed
Try to understand what I'm telling you
This is not a game don't you play the fool
I'm begging won't you hear my plea
This is not a theory it's reality

[Chorus]

Living in this cold world never easy
""Life ain't no sweet bread"" that's what my momma told me
I'm getting by and now I see what she mean
You need to settle down and stop living so extreme
I'm your woman and you know I'll always love you
I'll never do a single thing to exploit you
Life is so precious never take it for granted
How can I make you understand this baby

[Chorus]",Flesh and Bone
Shontelle,"I've been looking at you wondering if you even got
What it takes inna no you take me easy
Left right, left right, left right, focus pon me
Left right, left right, left right, focus pon me

From the most things I got you can't do it like me
There is no other
You a-watch and a-stare and a-wish
That this gal could'a be your baby momma
So watch me slow grind and a-wine
And in time never step outta line, baby
Make you bod all night feel the wickedest wine (focus every time)

So watch me slow wine baby
While I wine and dine baby
Make your mouth water with this heat
Me done work it, what is your weakness

Left right, left right, left right, focus pon me
Show it back, make it hot, take it right down for me
Left right, left right, left right, focus pon me

Shontelle,"[Chorus]
Hush little shorty don't you cry
I'll sing you a ghetto lullaby
When things get rough, let me dry your eyes
Give you the strength, hold your head up high
When this cold world never do you right
I'll hold you down through the darkest nights
Rest your head let me ease your mind
I'll sing you a ghetto lullaby

Where shall I begin
To teach you what could take a lifetime to learn
Enough lies will be told, with each day the truth will unfold
Picture if you can, a mountain so high that you can't see the top
An ocean so wide, you can see where it meets the sky
Well that's how far you're gonna have to go
Hold on tight shorty don't let go
Those rains will fall and those winds will blow
Out in those streets it can be so cold

[Chorus]

I'm looking at you, A picture of innocence framed within trust
Each river you cross, filled with the unknown not so treasureous
All envy and greed, Will rip you apart and leave you to bleed
An incessantly cut you up with no trace of mercy
Enough backstabbers and informers
Hate and disease so let me warn ya
Sharks in the ocean will raise their teeth
Lets all run fast when you see

[Chorus]

Oh
Dry your eyes don't you cry
Not tonight
If you just try you will find your sunrise

[Chorus]",Ghetto Lullabye
Shontelle,"[Verse 1]
Traveling down this rocky road
So hard to do it all alone
So I really need you
To help me to move along
All my sunshine's gone away
All my blue skies turning gray
It's like the ocean's all dried up and empty (empty)
So I really hope you understand
All the reasons why I can't pretend
That I don't need your love
And I can't ever break the chains

[Chorus]
I crave you, I breathe you, I taste you
I see you in my dreams
I'll never replace you, escape you, crazy as it seems
You said you'll never go any where
But every time I look around boy you gonna disappear
Still I cry still I try to save you
Baby boy I crave you (crave you)
Don't you know I love you
Don't you know I love you

[Verse 2]
So I see the sun rise
The tears falling from my eyes
Longing for you baby
And it makes my world so crazy
Oh now the pain is killing me, baby can't you save me
Won't you come, come to me, to me
Cause you got me trapped inside and now I can't escape
I'm scarred so deeply and now I can't erase the pain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boy text me for a while
Why you coming at me
It brings so much struggle and I strive
Karma brings so much pain ain't I'm in lie
Me sing still
You said you would'a never hurt me, never lie
And I never wanna splurt from in and I'm in lie
Still you only come and ah-use me (and ah-use me)
And it breaks me hard still you abuse me (you abuse me)
You got me hanging like a puppet from a string
You was the only ting I take control and I'm in lie
So why you coming at me ups 'n moving
You gonna turn me like some kinda Ara movie
What kind of thing you bring to all me suffering,
And still me wanna sing
Do anything to obvious
Me sing, me sing me really, really, really love you

[Chorus]

Don't You know I love you
I'm begging you please don't leave me no no

[Chorus]",I Crave You
Shontelle,"[Chorus]
Life is not an easy road
A true you just a struggle with your heavy load
I know
It seems it seems you lose the battle more and more
Life is not an easy road
You have to play your part and take control
Don't you ever ease up
Never give up
Don't let go

Hopeless youths them out inna the street
And them no have no job so just to win they have to cheat
Tell me why so many see it and don't speak
And why they'll never find a peaceful home they cyaan retreat
And them cyaan find no food to eat
And where you lay your head them have a bed of concrete
And your momma she ah cry when she ah see it
It's not a revolution just a cycle that repeats cause

[Chorus]

See the sunshine will come one day
And prejudice and inequality will fade away
Man will not judge man but he will say
It's time to love my neighbor as my brother and not hate
And the world will unite as one
And governments eliminate all chemicals and bombs
We will no longer have to run
The uprising has only just begun, so hear me song

[Chorus]

You see them little youth a cry them have cold cold feet
Dem prostitute them life them ah so them world get defeat
Dem politicians try fi take your life you see
But just trust you will survive and keep your dignity
Never mind how them a treat you never mind what them a say
Keep you eyes pon tomorrow but you live for today
You stop you drop you roll to save your soul
You never let them take it away
Sing

[Chorus]",Life Is Not an Easy Road
Shontelle,"Carry me home away from all these things
That keep deceiving me
I'm all alone nowhere no one
To show me where to go
Take my money wear my shirt
Using me to do your dirt
Judging me when all the time
You're the one that did the crime
Someone tell me what's the truth
Save the children, save the youth
What about our hopes and dreams
You're not what you really seem oh

Here's the church and here's its people
Preaching good and doing evil
Trying to treat you less than equal

Don't be cast into the sequel
Living in a nation of plastic people (plastic people)

[Verse 2]
You're just like a rose I wanna grow
So I can serve my purpose here
I wanna fly before I die
Be like a bird and touch the sky
Take my home, and take my name
Generation cellophane
There's no difference all the same
I don't know when I'm ashamed
Can you walk inside my shoes?
Don't be mad if I refuse
Artificial attributes,
Different leaders same old news

[Verse 3]
What do you know,
It's a situation begging for salvation
Looking to the sky to answer to all my frustration
There's a choice I'm making
And there's a chance I'll take it
It's the only life I got to live so I can't fake it

Shontelle,"When I, was young, and the light, had only begun;
To shine, down on me, I've been blind, now I've started to see

I don't have to be right
There's no power in empty passion
Lots it takes for the fight
Find the strength to be out of passion
Everybody knows me
You're the one who won't hear my story
Give it to ya for free
You're the man who won't share my glory

[Chorus]
Sing it out
Play it out
For the first time these words are spoken
Meet some thin
So I can love again
Shout it out
Turn around
Tell the whole world the spell is broken
Break these chains
I'm only human

[Bridge: x2]
No superwoman
I'm only human

When I show, my true face, give me faith, so I'm not afraid

Feels like I'm standing on the outside looking in
At the mess we left behind
And it's a long way to fall
I gave you everything I had
I gave it all
And then my heart was on the line

I can't hate you
Any longer
I know I'm going to miss you
I'll forget it and let it go.

Say hello to goodbye, 'cause its gone forever
No more try, you and I
Not now, not ever
And I get by without you
I'm not going back again
I'm not going to lie to you
'Cause, that was there and only then.

'Cause its a deadly combination, you and me
You know its undeniable
Even though we tried it all
We brought the worst out in each other

We can't act it anymore

What doesn't kill you
It makes you stronger

I'll forget it and let it go

I can't completely disconnect
Couldn't make the compromise
Didn't have a safety net

Shooter Jennings,"""Come on boys, let's hit the road!""
We left L.A. on Sunday, in Lubbock by Tuesday 
That's where we played our second show 
Where nobody knew us, so nobody noticed the songs that the band didn't know 
We were eatin' up the white lines, makin' good time 
Diggin' the songs on the radio 
And that party kept a movin' and you know what we were doin' 
We were smokin' up that California gold 

Now everyone was glad, ""The Weight"" played by The Band 
You know I never had that song ever let me down 
And I didn't notice I was speedin' but in the rear-view mirror blinkin' 
Were them state trooper's lights all spinnin' 'round 
We rolled down the windows, so we didn't think that he would notice 
Something smellin' funny in that smoke cloud 
And he asked, 'What you boys a-hidin'?' and we were all silent 
'Cause I think he heard us clear and loud 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
""Oh no, my Weed!"" 
He spread us all along the highway, cuffed us all and turned us away 
And started pokin' round the truck for cake 
And we all stood there high as a kite, and he found it alright 
And don't y'all make light of the number one dope dog in the state 
That mutt found the joint in my pocket that was buried and locked up 
In the back of the trailer underneath the guitars and the piano seat 
And off we went to jail all locked up in a cell 
Charged with possession of that sweet leaf 

And we were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
Now I was still pretty buzzed when they called in the judge 
Who greeted me with a smile and a warm handshake 
And he said, ""I'm so sorry"" 'cause they couldn't un-arrest us 
But that was up to some other official magistrate 
And he said, 'Don't you worry, son, all the charges are gone 
But I've got a few autographs for you to sign.' 
And they sprang us out right quick, so we could get up on the stick 
To Wichita Falls by show time 
To tell 'em
We were busted 
Busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County 
Busted, busted in Baylor County",Busted in Baylor County
Shooter Jennings,"There's a piggy waitin' outside my door 
Who's a knockin' and a yellin' that he's gonna use force 
Well, I moved to town just a while ago 
But I got in a mess, and I can't lay low 

Back home all I had was my guitar 
Livin' in the backwoods on Daddy's farm 
Sittin' on the front porch 'til the evenin' come 
Livin' in the backwoods on Daddy's farm 

Well, my old girl was a Cadillac 
She was long and sleek and dressed in black 
But I caught her cruisin' with another dude 
So I shot 'em down with my blue .22 

Back home all I had was my guitar 
Livin' in the backwoods on Daddy's farm 
Sittin' on the front porch 'til the evenin' come 
Livin' in the backwoods on Daddy's farm  

But now they got me runnin' and they got me to my home 
But I won't go, I won't go! 
Chitty-chitty bang-bang, and I hit the floor 
Two little piggies bust down my door 
The first little piggy went down 
The second little piggy started poppin' off rounds 
I make a break for the parking lot 
I heard some people talkin' how somebody got shot 
They're never gonna see it my way 
So I break for the truck and headed out on the highway 
I must have got it up to 108 
Before three little piggies headed me off the interstate 
It's gettin' hot, I'm gettin' hot 
I don't know where to go, I don't know what I got

Ain't it a shame, such a sad, sad shame

When she gets home she'll surely see 
You know it was so hard goin' through our life together 
Figurin' out what belongs to you and what belongs to me

When there's nothing left to lose anymore 
If there's a door, I'll go through and walk right into my lonesome blues

I cheat and I get caught 
They tell me that I'm lost but I don't care anymore

Living a free life 
Knowing that my flight is gonna crash and burn

But now I was born in Nashville but I left there long ago
'Cause they built music city by sacrificing soul
L.A. ain't much different, accept they got them fancy clothes
And there's nary a sight or a leaving light of solid country gold

'Cause they say country music ain't quite all it used to be
But they can't see the country for all the goddamned trees
If you give me to a guitar and my woman on the road
I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold alright

Now baby I been thinking 'bout where you and I should go
You sell your apartment, and I'll shake off my load
We'll take it down to Texas where we'll kiss that yellow rose
And find ourselves some loving in solid country gold

Well they say country music ain't quite all it used to be
But they can't see the country for all the goddamned trees
If you give me to a guitar and my woman on the road
I'll give to you my family, my solid country gold

Oh 'cause they say country music ain't quite all it used to be

May the evening bring your favorite night 
Sweet Savannah, you been gone so long 
But I've got to move on 

It's getting cold, I put my jacket on your back 
And we smoke a cigarette, the last one in the pack 
I still remember exactly what you said 
That you had demons that you couldn't put to bed 
Now I'm leaving, yeah, I'm moing out west 
And it's time for us to lay our history to rest 
I still remember a tear drop in your eye 
But you know I couldn't stand to see you cry

So I close on this Hollywood night 
Where this counter-culture cultivates an emptiness inside 
Would it be different if you were still here in my life 
Would I be sober, and would you be my wife?

I know we've had our problems lately 
And you've left me after all these years 
And I know I probably could've treated you better
Along the line I've seen my mistakes like that time 
That I took you to Waffle House 
And you made me mad and I made you walk home in the rain 
But you never got my sense of humor 
Anyway no you never laughed at my jokes

I never meant to hurt you
I never understood the hillbilly things I do
If our love don't work now darling maybe later
You can't see the tears behind my aviators

And oh I know I probably should've come home more often 
On those long lonely winter nights 
But you know out of all those women 
I was always your number one 
And I'm sorry about that time I got drunk 
And hit on your mom and slashed your daddy's tires 
But I figured they had it coming 
And I'm sorry about that time 
That I accidentally shot your dog 
While I was hunting and I told you he ran away 
Oh wait a minute I told you that didn't I? Oh darling

I could never share those secrets of my heart
I feel so much closer to you now that we're apart
If our love don't work now darling then maybe later

Yeah, I'll ride away with my freedom in my hands
To die another day in the broken promised land

Yeah, I'll ride away and I will leave you with the sun
To a life's some would call tragic
I was born unto the gun and I practice
Bad magick

The wind at my back, the desert at my feet
I know no love, my only friend is my steed
No one called family, my ties are severed clean
My mother is the mountain, my father is the stream

If you see me young lady, just turn and walk away
I'll be gone in the morn before you wake

Yeah, I'll ride away with my freedom in my hands
To die another day in the broken promised land

Yeah, I'll ride away and I will leave you with the sun

Yeah, I'll ride away and I will leave you with the sun

",Bad Magick
Shooter Jennings,"It's been sixteen weeks since I've been back home
I make a lot of money I don't know where it goes
All I know is the guitar and the bottle

My daddy was a loaded gun
He said, ""It ain't no fun living on the run, son""
But everywhere I go trouble seems to follow

So I ride
And I pick my songs at night at the next big show
My friends they come and they go
And love moves a little too slow
When you're riding with an electric rodeo

I can't complain, you know I do alright
Singing my songs in a different town every night
Looking for a woman to keep me warm tonight

From California to the dirt of New York
From Dallas, Texas to the streets of Baltimore
Wishing I was home with a little girl of my own

And I ride
I pick my songs at night at the next big show
My friends they come and they go
And love moves a little too slow
When you're riding with an electric rodeo

Oh, this time will be the last time
Oh, this time will be the last time

So I ride
Yeah, I pick my songs at night at the next big show
My friends they come and they go
And love moves a little too slow
When you're riding with an electric rodeo
And you ain't got no place, you can't rest your bones
",Electric Rodeo
Shooter Jennings,"Every time I think I smell that sweet southern rain
It takes me to a station on the long black train
I wanna hear the wind blow and feel the earth move below me
Despite of all the good times, I gotta rest my soul

So I'm gone, yes, I'm gone
Gone to Carolina, where I know that I belong
Yes, I'm gone, yes, I'm gone
Gone to Carolina, where I know I have a home

Every time I think I see your face in a crowd
It's like a bell inside of me and it's ringin' out loud
I've been so high for so long, there's nothing tried nor true
I'm thinking bout coming down, to lay a little on you

And I'm gone, yes, I'm gone
Gone to Carolina, where I know that I belong
Yes, I'm gone, yes, I'm gone
Gone to Carolina, where I know, I have a home
Take me home

Yes I'm gone, yes, I'm gone

Said, 'Son out in this world there's a lotta things

To be a good man just the same
And forget about the money

Now it's 15 years later
Now I'm out on the road
And it's been 4 years to day he died
And they won't even play us on the radio

And I think I've found my way alright
Without him here to catch me now and again
I just keep on moving along, keeping my mind on my song

Of all the things I need the most
I went and got myself a brand new vice
Well, the first time that I did it
I did it till the morning sun came

And all the little white lines, little white lines
Gonna sizzle up my brain

I woke up this morning, didn't recognize my own face
I was looking thin and pale, boys
With little lines all over the place
Sometimes I wake up with my woman
Sometimes another man's girl

And all the little white lines, little white lines
Gonna set fire to my whole world

Yeah, all the little white lines on the highway
I'll pick you up if you're going my way and you wanna roll
Yeah, little white lines pulling me down the highway
It's a dusty, bumpy road if you're going my way

Got myself in a little mess, got busted down around Abilene
I was going way to fast boys feeling lonesome, orney and mean
That judge said, ""Shave your face boy I'm kicking you down the line""

And all the little white lines, little white lines
Got me doing twenty years of hard time
Oh no, take me back to the way it was now, boy

Little white lines on the highway
I'll pick you up if you're going my way and you wanna roll

It's a dusty, bumpy road if you're going my way

Yes sir, oh, oh yes sir, yes sir
No, I haven't been drinking tonight
Oh, my license, yeah man, I think I left it in my other pants
Those pills are for my back, I got a bad back

You want me to what? I ain't getting out of this car
You want me to take what? What if I refuse?
Oh man, you want me to shave my what?

Shooter Jennings,"Well the songs I make, they ain't for livin'
And the things I take, they ain't for givin'
I'd gladly trade all my big city livin'
For some rowdy women and a honky tonk tonight

Well my mistakes give me my reputation
But them old sad songs were my education
And when I drift back home, I start to missin'
Some rowdy women, to pacify my mind

'Cause I have been high, I have been low
I've lost my mind and I stole the show
I'd gladly trade all my big city livin'
For some rowdy women and a honky tonk tonight

I nearly had one wife, she took to leavin'
Because of all my lies, she stopped believin'
And now I'm nine miles high, let me be forgiven
For givin' some rowdy women, a little piece of my mind

'Cause I have been high, I have been low

With a bag, a bottle and this old guitar
In the back of some bus on the road
I'm living the high life with nothing to show
But a love that's letting me go

Your heroes turn out to be assholes
The light that you're chasing in the tunnel is a train
The singer's in key, the guitars in tune
But the song is still slipping away

And the lights of the city paint a stage in the night
For two hearts breaking in time
And wild horses are cursed with their freedom in mind
And a hunger left burning inside

Your heroes turn out to be assholes
And the light in the tunnel that you're chasing is a train
The singer's in key, the guitars in tune
But the song is still slipping away

Then slowly nothing else matters
As the white and the black become gray

Late last night, a searchlight
I saw a ball of fire streak across a midnight sky

You told me the secrets of your heart? your hungry heart
Now you?ve seen all that can happen
With lipstick and crimes of passion
And lying kisses of fate
That can fall along the way Jenny

The silent screams
You see boys out there racing
A quick time for what they?re facing
And girls lost in love
Do you remember how it was ? Jenny?

A reading fom the book of Sense Live Song 55 Verse 1, I ran 25 miles blind through the wicked terrain but due to my superior conditioning I maintained and survived my deadly mission. It's crazy the world we live in there's no doubting, But Armageddon it ain't coming in thi year 2000. Me, I know 2000 million armies sprouting, spirits arousing, kids from the burbs and public housing. With 10 worlds to dwell from Buddhahood to hell. Miguel Angel, it seems my poppa named me very well. It's necessary that we spread the love to every. If you touch the life of one, you touch th lives o plenty. So people, let the truth be known, we own the will and the way and so tell me what's the delaying. These are the latter days and benefits will be received. But only for the faithful who truly believe.

chorus
This is for the faithful who truly believe that Babylon is gone, you got everything yu need in your pal. So sing songs of thanks and praise. These are the fatter days, the latter days

When I appear I be the natural 4 divisions of the year; spring, summer, fall, winter, lend me your ear, got this mic her about to start a renaissance, unite all the colors of the world like Benetton. Keep the faith and move on, evolve, don't let it dissolve. Everybody sees the breaks, problems were made to be solved, the power's in your palm, the future's in your hand, open with possibilities, focus, why be afraid? Enter the unknown. Free where life gives you surprises, surprises give you life and your spirit energizes, reaching new horizons, promoting the uprising, rising above cuz el demonio be snuffin. So people, let the truth be known, we own the will and the way and so tell me what's the delaying. These are the latter days and benefits will be received. But only for the faithful who truly believe.

As soon I came out the womb my mama knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course trippin' wit' The Osbournes
I seen the show with Travis Barker: ""Rockstar Mentality""
I'm jumpin' in the crowd just to see if they would carry me
And white bitches wanna marry me; they see me, they just might panic
My ice make 'em go down quick, like the Titanic
Yeah, I'm wit' Da Shop Boyz; you know what we do
I'm surfin', screamin' ""Kowabunga!""

[Chorus x 2]
They lookin' at my jewels, and they see a player icy
They kick it like they cool, but I can tell they wanna fight me
I keep the girls choosin', turn 'em out and have 'em dikin'
They never tell me ""naw."" Why? 'Cause they like me

Hey man, hold up, please; girl, you see this bling?
Don't you see these diamonds? (What that is?) These shiny things
Look at all my rings, compliment my bracelet
I think my chain stank 'cause people makin' ugly faces
I had two girls at the same time, and I had 'em dikin'
Knowin' damn well if I ain't rap, they probably wouldn't even like me
But, fuck it, I stay icy; ask about me in Atlanta
I'm a shop boy, flexin' on the track with Mr. Banner

[Chorus x 2]

She said: ""You let me touch ya chain, I'll let you poke it""; this shit ain't hard to notice
Grab the knot and let her throw it just to show her how I blow it
I'm a player and she know it, and I ain't scared to show it
I take her to my partner's, let 'em bust and leave her heartbroken
Them busters kick it like they cool, but they haters to they heart
Yeah, they talk behind my back 'cause they been haters from the start
I send them haters to the stars, then kick it with they wifey
They never tell me ""naw."" Why? 'Cause she like me

[Chorus x 2]

I can tell they envy me 'cause they see a player fly
My earrings bling-a-ling, chain look like tye-dye
See, we got different color girls, but they always stick together
When I say move, they move; boy, they ready for whatever
I can see it in your eye; boy, don't make no false move
I know that you don't like me, but you better keep it cool
Don't mean no disrespect, and I ain't tryin' to be rude
But, look, you gotta know that I always keep a tool (Yessir!)

Shorty Baker,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

To be mad, to be yours alone

I tell you I mean it

You'll meet honest men, and pick-pockets skilled,

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen I learnt how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

But just like the wounded and when it's too late
They'll remember they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

A shot in the dark not a thing that you can do

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Shota Osabe,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

本当は少し予感してた
君が隣にいる日々も 僕が少し変わる事も

静かに僕の中に
注がれる君という滴
君色に染まっていく 君も僕に染まっていく

だからもっと愛すよ
だからもっと愛して
誰かが僕らを素敵だと思うように

ミルクティーみたいに
ふたり寄り添って
少しの甘さで幸せになれる気がするよ

例えば悪い癖とか
隠してる弱さやルーズさを
君は肯定しないけれど 否定もせず抱きしめたね

君が好きな僕で在りたいから
僕が好きな君で在り続けて
秋の空に憧れが汗をかいて滲んでる

宝物だよ
だからこそ怖いよ
いつか飲み干して空っぽになった時

君を全部僕に 注いでほしいんだ
そのあと 一番君の好きな場所で
キスをしよう

僕らの住む世界に
悲しみが混ざらないように
明るい方に向かって going 手を離さないで

Shotta,"Nadie es feliz para siempre
Aprovecha tu presente
Felicidad intermitente

Eres la psique más bonita que uno puede tener
Eres la chica más cara y más mala
Vete a saber
Si cuando vienes vienes de verdad
O de broma, no sé
A todas horas, a solas, estoy enganchado a tu placer

Yo quiero que esta canción suene
Como un niño al nacer
Con el miedo y el llanto
De todo por conocer
Buscando la felicidad quizá te puedas perder
Yo sólo quiero sentirte como la primera vez

Tú sólo quieres salir de este mundo
Oscuro por fin
Dejar atrás toda la movida negativa en un plis
Es complicado como el tiempo y la vida
Por decidir
El camino es duro y procuro tenerte por aquí

¡Felicidad! ¿dónde estás?
Enséñame el camino
A veces creo que no existes
Que eres un estado de ánimo
Nadie es perfecto tú piensa eso
Si sale del corazón lo que escribes
Tendrá más peso
Piensa que el odio es un lastre
Ápartalo de en medio
La vida sin amor es el pozo de un cementerio
Eres la droga, la que mata la tristeza
La que limpia las lágrimas
En el alma cuando todo pesa

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado
Contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya la tienes compártela
Y sino no vale na
Hay felicidad pa' cada hombre
En cada nación

Felicidad vente p'acá
Que yo te canto
Hay quien es feliz con cien millones en el banco
Se nota en la cara, en la actitud
Cuando uno está feliz
Se le enciende la luz
A veces la razón no sirve, no funciona
No sucede
Hay personas que nunca se olvidan
Porque el corazón no quiere

La sonrisa de una madre
Eso es felicidad
La vida va mejor sin prisas
El positivismo se guisa
Trabaja cada dia para ser feliz
Difícil de conseguir
Ahí esta la meta
Da amor a tus amigos y a tus enemigos, sí
No te vayas a la cama con rencor
Déjalo fluir
¿Se portaron mal contigo?
No seas vengativo
El olvido y el perdón son el mayor castigo

¿Tu novia te dejó?
Sal que te dé el aire
Si el amor se acabó yo lo que no quiero
Es engañarme
Lo que no se suelta en lágrimas
Se va con los suspiros
Yo solo suelto un te quiero cuando el corazón me obliga
Digo booom!
Felicidad intermitente
Aprovecha tu presente
Nadie es feliz para siempre

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya la tienes compártela
Y sino no vale na
Hay felicidad pa´cada hombre en cada nación
Felicidad en la tormenta
Es un rallo de sol
Después de la batalla recibir bendición
Vivir lejos de lágrimas
Cerca del amor
Felicidad es tremenda sensación
Porque la vida con felicidad es más intensa
Vivir rodeado del dinero no compensa
La felicidad es la mayor recompensa
Mucho más que oro, que carros y ofrendas

La felicidad
Toda la vida buscándola
Y si quieres saber dónde está
Observa tu recorrido, mi hermano
Ella siempre ha estado a tu lado contigo
Y la felicidad
Si ya al tienes compartela

Show & A.G.,"[Intro: Showbiz & A.G.]
Showbiz got props, tell me who got the props
A.G. got props, tell me who got the props
Give me my props for '92
It's me and Showbiz, and this is what we gonna do
Give you some now, save some for later
Here's a portion, yo Show, kick the flavor

[Showbiz]
Record labels try and juice me (for what?) for my papers
The offer me a mule (and what else?) and 40 acres
I'm dissing snakes now, there's no time to catch the vapors
I'm not a pup (for what?) a Muppet caper
And all the ghetto groupies get free with the quickness
And Show concentrates and only thinks about business
I hate a sellout cause he puts me in a rage
I play KRS and throw that ass off the stage
So give me my props cause I always stay clever
And ain't nothing changd but the weather
Get your act together, cause I got mines together
Don't front on the brother with the Pelle Pelle leather
I'm Show be	-I-Z, my partner's A.G.
Chill with Greg N-I-see-E or my brother D-are-E-S
And what's up to Lord Finesse
And I'd like to give shouts to my peeps Shorty and Wes
People say I'm soup, crazy cash I recoup
Nowadays I just troop in my green Legend coupe

[A.G.]
Record companies try to juice me for my papers
They offer me a mule and about 40 acres
They try ot gain from my royalties
Push me towards the dotted line but you know I didn't sign
Labels know straight up when we meet
Interfere with my career and it's back to the streets
Bang bang or the pow pow
I settle the beef the best way I know how
Release the savage beast if I'm not taking care
Rap is my career and it's my only way outta here
Every chance I do damage
And I manage to use all the anger to my advantage
All that is cool, but my brain is the tool
Gimme my props so we all can rule
Don't show off my skills, I just sprinkle em
And you're sleeping on my props, wake up before you wrinkle them

Gimme my props yo, more than a cop yo
Til I master hip-hop, I won't stop yo  (Repeat 4x)

[Showbiz]
The say BMW's a Black Man's Wish
I wish for an SP-1200 and some discs
Negativity the least, my material's is cease
Saying peace to the brothers in the belly of the beast
People saying ""Why Show want to rhyme?""
I didn't want to get back and do Fed time
I want to live right and exact, I don't want to be the fat cat
Off the crack and have the Feds down my back
If the money's stacked, take a step back, black
Or you'll be wearing four four numbers like a quarterback
I was raised one deep by mom dukes and no dad
And now I grab a number two pencil and a pad
Or Erasermate if I make mistakes I erase
And me a Diamond go diggin' in the crates
(Where's my 40 acres?)  Not the projects of course
I asked for a mule, I got an iron horse
Shit goes on as the song plays
Can a devil fool a Muslim?  Nah, not nowadays

[A.G.]
On your mark, get set, pass the 40, let's jet
A fat rhyme is what you want, a fat rhyme is what you'll get
It's thorough, from beginning to end
The beat is fat, what can I say?  Show you did it again
I got the hat on my head, Pepe's on my behind
Fans on my back, and money on my mind
I don't sweat the stress, take the bitter with the sweet
Did I let you know I have the Tims on my feet?
You know my stats when I came around
Saying ""Damn he's living fat"" when I haven't even gained a pound
Friends til the end, never will I diss ya
My people's R.I.P., you know I'm gonna miss ya
40 acres and my props, the name of the song
A.G. is saying peace and I'm gone

Show & A.G.,"""I like my pockets fat not flat"" (repeat 4x)

""I like my pockets fat not flat"" ""So get back"" (repeat 4x)

[Showbiz]
My pockets stay fat, and they always like that
Not only in pocket but in my bank there's stacks and stacks of dough
Cause I move slow, I get my cash flow, and then I go
And brother's don't know, I'm on the down low
Some get mad cause they can't understand
That I'm 23 years old, I'm in command
I'm down with DITC, that's ""Diggin' in the Crates""
And my partner A.G., we always keep crazy papes
I'm staying fat, cause what comes around goes around
I always help out and help a brother when he's down
And out like a boyscout, brothers always shout
""Good lookin out Show""  Yeah, without a doubt
But don't try and take advantage
I'll just leave you alone instead of putting that ass in bandages
Signing off is Show be	-I-Z
And next up is A.G., he likes his pockets F-A-T

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 4x)

[A.G.]
Check it out yo, A.G. is living fat
In the mental, in other words can I get a soul clap?
Diggin' in the crates for something smooth
Showbiz & A.G., yo money, we make the party groove
And I'm a top-notch competitor
Carrying dough like a treasurer
Getting pussy, oh that's regular
But the sex I never take
Cause if that bitch screams rape, like Mike Tyson, I'm upstate
And you know that's a fact, black
So if she says no, that means no, and that's that
No matter how cute or how desperate
(Ayo she gotta get the boot)  Yeah, she gotta see the exit
But I'm not mad I didn't hit it
I just dial seven digits and some skins that's with it
Bones in the closet, that's my logic
You gotta be smart and keep a downlow in the projects
Watch your step and take it easy
Or act like Stevie Wonder because you know you can't see me
Don't sniff no coke, but I might drink a brew
Or maybe two (Andre the Giant, not you)
Yeah, wrecking MC's with just my demo
And pulling all the cuties with no problemo
That's right, because I'm a gamer
Your girl let you for me, A.G., I don't blame her
Step back, get your sticks and your bats
Know you step up because my pockets are fat

""I like my pockets fat not flat""  (repeat 3x)

[Showbiz]
It's time to take the brothers from the corner
Clean up they act, and give them a chance to do what the want to
I'm not trying to be a bum with a 40
That's not my style, I gotta work hard like Naughty
By Nature, you should understand
To get yours in this land, you gotta work for yours, black man
You think it's easy because I rap?
So don't ask me for a dollar motherfucker, you ain't handicapped
And if you was, you'd still have the chance
Look how I flip ""ain't this a bitch"" now I'm making you dance
Yeah it's Show be	-I-Z from your neighbor H-double-O-D, I are-A-P
Cause I want to stay fat
To keep clothes on my back and you know I never slack
For all the bums that said I forgot where I came from
Eating crumbs on the corner in the slums
I'm hungry enough to grow fangs
Here's a dollar, go to the store, but give me back my fucking change
I'm not trying to spend on so-called friends
Not even with skins, put that bullshit to an end
So fuck the groupies on tour
I'm trying to make a million dollars, some shit I never saw before
So save that bullshit for later
So when I'm large, hoes give me head on an escalator
Yeah, I like to flow, I'm Show be	-I-Z

Check it, many try to come close
Rest in peace to the deceased and the rest are comatose
I'm not a joke and I go for broke
And while I'm laughing you'll be gagging from the motherfucking gunsmoke
Walk the streets and I play for keeps
And while I entertain suckers stay six feet deep
It was good while it lasted
Broken bones and asses, tombstones and caskets
I got fleeced, I'm not strapped, I'm a get you back
Me saying ""Mayday"" with an AK, picture that
Getting my props while you're propless
And if you try and escape, we'll take grandma for hostage
I carry my joint
Hoping to smoke a sucker just to keep on point
When Dre's team goes to extremes call up an M.D.
Wetting a strip til my whole clip is empty
Oh-ops and tecs ready to wreck the site
Whoever's next to step is knifed in broad daylight
Don't try to run, you'll get blocked off
I got spotted by a cop, so now that cop is knocked off
if I get back I get out with the quickness
The D.A., the judge and the jury's on my hitlist
Dressed in black with a hoodie and a low hat
(What you did?)  Spoke to the witness, now the witness don't know jack
The Giant and his crew are ill
We're sick-ass convicts, we're hard to kill

My boys from New York         (Is hard to kill)
The brothers from Jersey      (Is hard to kill)
I say out in Philly           (Is hard to kill)
And the brothers in Boston    (Is hard to kill)
To all my peeps in Cali       (Is hard to kill)
Don't forget about Atlanta    (Is hard to kill)
To all my boys in Connecticut (Is hard to kill)
To my crew in Texas           (Is hard to kill)

I'm around the way, 141st and 3rd
40 bottles on the curb and my man got the bag of herb
Another brother tried to get ill
And try to take me out on my block, he forgot I was hard to kill
I ran for cover so the brother missed
He hit my man in the head, now Ed is dead, yo what is this?
I won't stop until I see him rest
He got popped by the cops, too late for the EMS
Ain't no chance for survival (Why's that?)
He tried to go head on, now he's dead on arrival
Now you know I don't play around
Cause the clown is face down and uptown is his burial ground
You want beef?  Well the more the merrier
And I'm a bury that man's clan in the same area
My entourage is fully strapped
Turning your hard bodyguards to wussy, and pussy cats
You know how we do it
Putting the glock to the test, go get your vest, I'm going right through it
He survived in intensive care
Did the impossible in the hospital (Knocked him off right there)
I'm an expert at disposal
You see, everyone goes, on foes I'm killing hoes too
Nobody takes the witness stand
Your ass is out, I'm cleaning niggas out like Spic 'n' Span
You want beef with a mastermind?
But it's fine, pass the nine, now it's disaster time
I love conflict and confrontation
Killing enemies worse than Kennedy's assassination
But that's not my style
I just got buckwild so I could prove I was versatile
Styles go on and on
A.G. is all about peace, speaking of peace, now I'm gone

To the brothers in D.C.             (Is hard to kill)
And the brothers in VA              (Is hard to kill)
Down in North Carolina              (Is hard to kill)
How about the brothers in Maryland? (Is hard to kill)",Hard to Kill

He say, she say, brothers be yapping
Running they mouths and don't even know what happened
Just for conversation you run your lip
And now my man's got problems, so now he's got to flip
His girl is heated, and she's leaving too
Because you ran your mouth, what you said wasn't even true
See my man's name is Victor
His brother Mike is boning Shante, that's Eric's sister
Mike had a girl, but Shante knew
But on the downlow a little rendezvous
One day upstairs the two were chilling
His girl popped up, yep yep, she started illing
Mike said that's Victor's undercover lover
So victor caught on and had to cover for his brother
Walked Shante home, and said so long
But somebody saw the two and thought they had something going on
It got around like a hula hoop
And you made it your business, Victor's girl knew the scoop
Know she's beefing, flipping and crying
Didn't believe when he said that they were lying
It's over, the relationship is done
Victor was a loyal brother if I ever knew one
You say he's wrong, but that's not a fact
See if you don't know the story then you shouldn't say jack
Well it's over anyway, huh
And Victor is the victim of he say, she say

(""He say, she say, I heard it throught the grapevine"" - Greg Nice) (repeat 4x)

Losing a girl is one thing, but there's another side
Of he say she say, a lot of brothers died
All the gossip don't belong in the streets
>From another brother talking now you got major beef
Two kids had a beef, one was your man
They went out like troopers, and they went out with their hands
Your man took a loss, but he left it at that
But you made it your business to say he was coming back
The other kid wouldn't have it
So he ran to his car, yeah he packed the automatic
And you knew he wasn't joking
So you called up your man, ""Yo yo, we gotta smoke em""
Came downstairs with the nine and the vest
Little did you know he didn't aim for the chest
Caught him in the head, now your man is dead
Rest in peace chief, cause of something that you said
Tell it to his family on his funeral day
And your man is a victim of he say, she say

(""He say, she say, I heard it throught the grapevine"" - Greg Nice) (repeat 4x)

Somebody told my man that the Giant is dead
He went out like a trooper and took two to the head
Somebody said to me that I'm not A.G.
Because the Giant is dark-skinned and 6'3""
Somebody told Show that A.G. can't flow
That witch is crazy, because you know I'm good to go
(Ayo I heard Showbiz is making money off the crack)
He doesn't have to Jack, because he's making fat tracks
You don't even know and that's upsetting me
And I won't be a victim, so don't put me in Jeopardy
The ones who yapped this goes out
Always putting other words in other people's mouth
I'm a end it on this note, okay?

Once again back again with my friends
Diamond's beats are fat just like a Benz
Andre the Giant is great, but I should also mention
Lord Finesse, he's the Funky Technician
I'm on my way to the studio, it's the only way that I know
How to play down low
Punching keys like Rocky Balboa
Saying rest in peace to Tshaka Figeoroa
Some got to grow up before they blow up
And did you ever know a young brother who had shit sewed up?
Rented some BM's some Volvos, some Benz
So much jewls I had to pass shit down to my friends
But when down and out and pockets are low
See how fast friends go when there's no cash flow
So I head for the top, times are hard
Pushing moms, no pops, I had to get my own props
I can wild out, but instead
I just keep to myself and Showbiz just hold his head

Take it from the Giant cause I've been there and back

Stay strong on your path, and you will make it

Is this the day you pull me over, searching for cracks and coke?
What's the problem, you know I'm sober
If you drove a fucking Nova you wouldn't have to pull over
You're making me late, my papers is straight
Never hesitate to run a check and then let me skate
Take my business card, it's in my left hand
You got the right motherfucker but the wrong goddamn plan
So pass me by, or you wonder why
Niggas pull out their glock and point it right between your eye
But I got my shit together, I never flip with the weather
And I always think clever
I think positive and legit
I gotta give big shouts to my peeps Kendu and Infinite
Brothers stare into my face like I'm a sucker
It's too easy to kill another young motherfucker
So I ignore it, I turn the other cheek
Yo Show, you ain't got any time for these niggas, these boys is weak
Some punks want to spit razors shit for rocks
Packing a glock, and I don't shoot blanks
Young boys that thought they was ready, step to this
They made wrong moves because that ass got rocksteady
Down the line, far from kind
Whip in behind, and still packing nothing but a nine
Back on the block, or out on the streets
I recoup a Dre's scheme real neat to make ends meet
But I can't live trife, shot stabbed with a knife
I want kids and a wife, not 25 to life

To choke your ass so hard, you're spittin' fuckin' adam's apple juice.
So come check the magic show by Deshawn,
And witness the way I put you to death with a magic wand.
Turnin' your home to a casket,
Turn your wife into a widow and your son into a bastard.
Cause I love to keep M-C's sufferin',
Beggin' for big, heavy bags of bufferin'.

I got crazy niggas in the city noid
Got mad bitches, but it's not cause I'm a motherfuckin' pretty-boy
I'm ruthless, I'm not on that goody-goody tip
That shit played out with that beat street/electric boogie shit
I'll stomp any rapper that you ?
If they ass is weak, they better chill and grab a seat
And go 'head with they master plan
Stevie wonder probably see me 'fore half you rappers can
You can't hang and you're fallin' fast
You rappers that's trash better dash and start haulin' ass
Cause I'm out to rag shit
Fuck up a show, collect my dough
And step off with a bad bitch
Spectators always have the best time
When they come to a show and hear a funky lord finesse rhyme
I'm out to get bigger, lounge and make rich figures
You'll never catch finesse associating with bitch niggas
I work overtime when it's time to go for mine

So it's time for me to step
Peace to showbiz and ag and I'm off to the left

I'm the man. the one-man-band is on my right hand.
(his name is show nitwit, so get wit the program)
I get a hit from my Buddha blessed.
Turn my hat to the back, now let's see who's the best.
I like my pockets fat, never ever flat.
Niggas wanna jack, my .45 ain't havin' that.
Hoes get no dough, so why try?
Think it's gonna be a hit 'n' run? wrong, it's a drive-by.
Niggas catchin' tantrums,because your girl's never safe around
The midnight phantom.
They predicted I'm-a fall,
They must be down with Michael Jackson cause that shit is off the wall.
You don't believe me, ask that brother show,
Snatchin' hotties, grabbin' hotties, lettin' mothafuckers know.
You come wrong if you don't come strong,
You better catch wreck! mothafucker, I made the song.
Styles will vary, they won't carry over.
Don't fuck with no devil, I'd rather marry Oprah.
Yeah, you got it, I'm pro-black,
And my skills are so phat, I pay my dues, I don't owe jack.
You bite my style, I can spot it.
Tryin' real hard to get it,
You can forget it, because you don't got it.
And my skills are excellent, diggin' in the crates
And it's time to represent!

[Chorus]",Represent
Show & A.G.,"Runaway... runaway slave (8X)

Verse One: A.G.

Livin in the slums with the bums, the rats and the stray cats
Dogs with the rabies, little babies are having babies
Juveniles act wild
Every footstep you take, on every corner there's a crack vial
Pushers, dealers, crackheads are buying
Now the dealer's in jail, all the crackheads are dying
My man got AIDS, he was hit hard
To get laid, he paid a crackhead for a five dollar quick job
In the ghettoes this stuff you have to find
A beer will relax my mind but I still pack my nine
Cause I'm aware of all evil and devilishment
Because I'm living in a rat like settlement
Sometimes it's hard to manage
I grab a forty take a sip and let the mental do the damage
Yeah I'm woozy and my eyes are red
But it's better than a uzi and a brotherman is dead
See nine out of ten are black on black crimes
Four out of nine were killed before their prime
The other five wanted vengeance
So now five out of five are doin a jail sentence
Ask the Giant I've been through it
So when I reach to the top, I say the ghetto made me do it
And I know how to strive, huh
Born and raised in the ghetto so you know I can survive

Chorus:Runaway... runaway slave (8X in background)

I gotta getaway, I gotta do it now
or find a better way, so how that sound (both lines repeat 4X)

Verse Two: A.G.

Chapter two, of every black man's diary
Drugs and diseases, put in our society
Kill another brother and it's bravery
Come on that's one step backwards into mental slavery
Yeah you best believe that's reality
You got black on black then there's police brutality
Yeah it's bad but what makes it sad
Is that I'm being harassed by a black man with a badge
He's sellin out because he's two-faced
But you only got one race, you only got a nigga's face
He's sellin out because times is hard
And old ladies are gettin robbed cause I can't find a job
Fight to the top, and the other man'll drop
and gettin treated like savages will stop
You got the right plan, but goin about it the wrong way
Divided is the long way united is the strong way
Too many died for us to take a pause
So let's all get ours, and stop tryin to get yours
Walk a straight path, but it's so easy to stumble
So weak minds crumble in the concrete jungle
Get your chance to sell drugs, you don't pass up
But a fast buck will wind up to be your last buck
It's a damn shame, you're deaf dumb and blind
Did it ever cross your mind, you're killin off your own kind
And pretty soon even you will be a goner
Easy access to guns, liquor stores on every corner
Street knowledge is a must, you never learn enough
You're physically rough, but mentally you gotta be tough
We shall overcome with no doubt
The runaway slave is sayin peace and I'm out

Chorus

I gotta getaway, I gotta do it now
or find a better way, so how that sound (2X)

Show & A.G.,"[Showbiz]
Yeah, it's time to silence the lambs.  Let niggas know what time it is
on the real tip, know what I'm saying?  Showbiz & A.G. killing all the
garbage going around, know what I'm saying?  A.G. still got it going on,
Showbiz got it going on.  And we going to kick a little flavor like this.
In 1992, I silence the lambs.

[A.G.]
Now this goes for those who thought I fell
But it's more to tell, cause them suckers are sort of jel
Cause the Giant finally got his props
We can box rhyme for knots and see who got the biggest glocks
It don't matter cause I can withstand
I got no hair on my chest but I'm still the motherfucking man
I won't fall and I never fell
Busting and chrushing tall all of y'all who take a fucking L
You think you're able to win?
You better chill cause you never will, you ain't and you never been
You can't faze me so sit and praise me
When I'm finished slaying y'all be saying ""That nigga's crazy""
That's how I like it, yeah they fear me
Their face is scary, they know I'm coming but they can't hear me
I'm crushing motherfuckers that's coming up
The champ is me, see, it ain't no runner ups
I'm catching wreck because I'm getting vexed
You can forget it if you think you're going to get it and rip it next
Yeah, whatever's clever
And like Heatwave I'm slaying niggas always and forever
Let me know that I'm still the man
And killing all the riff raff in the silence of the lambs

[Showbiz]
Showbiz and I silence the lambs
To my partner A.G., silence the lambs
To my man Lord Finiesse, silence the lambs
To my peeps Gangstarr, silence the lambs
To Nice and Smooth, silence the lambs
To my peeps Black Sheep, silence the lambs
To my man Chi-Ali, silence the lambs
To my man Jazzy Jay, silence the lambs
To my partner Diamond D, silence the lambs
To my man Fat Joe, silence the lambs

[A.G.]
Now who's stepping first, cause it's time for the second verse
You want to withdraw?  Then don't stall, cause it's getting worse
I gotta show off my stuff
If it's a 40 I'll take a sip, if it's a blunt, then I'll take a puff
I'm undisputed even when I'm bhudded
So act like Bo Jackson after surgery and don't do it
Yapping, diss A.G., it won't happen
While your jaws are japping, it's your girl that I'm tapping
Then she'll bust a nut and guess what, now I'm flowing
You try and act wild, I'll pull ya foul cause your style is stolen
My crew said to catch wreck
Then tell me why you want to flex showing knowing that I'm going next?
Is it because I'm your idol right?
Cause I'm hitting harder than a champ in a heavyweight title fight
You tried to quote some shit I wrote
You try to play me like a kid and I'll shove a doll down your fucking throat
You see me coming, start ducking down
When I speak, you don't speak, so shhhh, don't make a fucking sound
You want to go through hell?
Well you thought I fell, so come on and take a fucking L

[Showbiz]
Rappers caught jel when I jumped on the scene
They said I was a rookie and my name was Charlie Sheen
Some talked about my concert, they said I was wack
And 20% of beats was in my house in stacks and stacks
If I was blind I might break like a referee
So the next man can't see round two or three
It takes round one to get the job done
A lesson and a blessing it's great to be Show, son
I don't talk tough, I'm not a tough guy
I'd rather buy a bean pie from a guy with a bow tie
Peace to F.O.I. cause they got the skills
To make brothers that act ill, chill
Wall to wall on the dance floor
I want to see your arms up even if you ain't sure
Before I kick styles that's legit
You gotta cover the mic with tissue cause I talk much shit
I leave girls with a smile and fellas real stunned
I make hard rocks split away, forget those young guns
Here's a new rap list blowing rappers out the anus
If you weak and grab the mic I'll make you famous
So don't flip or I'll hush you like a kid
In a crib, damn, it's time to silence the lamb

Big L gotta silence the lambs
To my man D'Shawn gotta silence the lambs
To Naughty By Nature, silence the lambs
A Tribe Called Quest gotta silence the lambs
To the Zulu Nation, silence the lambs
To my man Kid Kapri, silence the lambs
To the crew Main Source, silence the lambs
To BDP, silence the lambs
To the brother Freddie Foxxx, silence the lambs
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth silence the lambs
Afrika Bambaataa gotta silence the lambs and
X-Clan gotta silence the lambs",Silence of the Lambs
Show & A.G.,"[Showbiz] 

Yeah  1992  Showbiz & A.G.  we about to catch wreck. And I 

Got my main man Diamond D  he's about to catch wreck from 

Diggin' in the crates and all that. And I'd like to say 

I chop off the head off of all those that commercialize! 

We got real bad bwoy in effect. Come Diamond D  come correct! 



[Diamond D] 

Yo check it 

See I'm back on the block but my name ain't Quincy 

Yeah, I'm chopping rappers up into mincemeat 

Step up and speak if your shit ain't weak 

The beat's for the jeep kid, they don't come cheap 

I practice my craft so you can call me macaroni 

And I get cheese and more run that a pony 

Smoke a lotta herb but I don't chew tobacco 

When Show drops the beat I say ""Holy mackerel!"" 

The stunts don't front any longer 

See my status is large, and the props are getting longer 

Ride around with Lou Dog in the Path 

Sit back and laugh or maybe sign an autograph 

I'm walking tall, but yo I'm not a cracker 

Don't run with the burgeouis, my crew's much blacker 

So give a shout for the man with the clout 

Sippin' on a Guinness stout, yo I'm about 



Showbiz, my man's still diggin' in the crates 

Diamond D, yeah I'm still diggin' in the crates (repeat 2x) 



[Showbiz] 

Ayo, it's often said, but it's never read 

That Diamond got a beat for every dread in his head 

But don't be mislead (Why?) Cause breakbeats are dead 

I'm not the Biz, who runs around with Super Pro Keds 

I'm just a cool brother, who hangs out in a top shop 

And I still get my props when giving brothers knots 

So step up front, yeah, that's if you want it 

It's time to breathe there's no future in fronting 

Cause they know, and I know, and she know, and we know 

That I'm an old champ like Bruno Samitino 

Or Ivan Pusky or the brother Tony Atlas 

Buy my EP and Showbiz will be the fattest 

And baddest is my status, I knew a man named Thatus 

Who rode a night train to Georgia just like Gladys 

Knight and the Pips, there's no 40's on my lips 

Yo pass the Moet, I might flip and take a sip 

And sit back and puff a blunt with Slick Nick 

Sometimes he puff slow, sometimes he puff quick 

I'd rather grab the mic and concentrate on getting papes 

I'm out, and I'm still diggin' in the fucking crates

It's Lord Finesse  the rhyme vet 

Like Bigge  I'm ""Ready to Die"" but it ain't my fucking time yet 

I bring the noise like static  I cause havoc 

When I grab the mic I pack a party like traffic 

You know my style  I got the hip sound 

I should be a construction worker  the way I be tearing shit down 

One of the best  you ought to shout it 

Bust a nigga's ass and won't give two thoughts about it 

Word, I hunt you down 

I got a million reasons why none of you can fuck around 

I slay beginners, sautee contenders

I kick facts, flip raps over hip tracks 

You know what I'm saying? (Yeah, I can dig that) 

I'm gifted, my rhyme is wicked 

When it comes to knowledge, I got jewels like the Diamond District 

I'm the dopest, the baddest, one of the fattest

I flow the same in a competition 

I break them clowns into something different, buck 'em with the fucking Smith & 

Wesson, MC's never leave my section 

Finger on the trigger, I figure I kill that nigga for stepping 

I tote the four-fifth, riff and get your jaw shift 

Flip phones and add jewels got me looking gorgeous 

Ignore the style and get bucked down, child 

With the three-pound pile, BLOW! How you like me now? 

The new improved Flow, you know how I do so 

Whatever, a motherfucking terror like Cujo 

I'm out to get mine, I want mils, God

It's D-Flow, you know my steelo, ceelo will let you know how we go

Suckers careers get stopped so stop who you riffing with 

I'm on point with the snakes and fakes 

Ain't the one (Think I am?) You get hung like drapes 

And it's proven, point blank that's the conclusion 

Seeing me losing, it's all an illusion 

Like the raw ism, I'm a kiss him when I hurt him 

Then desert him, because the Show & A.G. shit is sickening 

Giving stress to them snakes is a ritual 

Nights and north flakes, oh yes, they bless the physical 

Promote the glock? No I'm not 

I use it as an art, ain't got the heart to disrespect hip-hop

And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

One more moon dance with you
In the moon light, on a magic night
All the moon light, on a magic night
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?",Moondance

Go step to my battle field.
Where my niggas come from.
All we know is kill bill. That's right.
Breaking neck, we ain't showing no respect.
Try me, Some niggas at no will.
Now watch me slow it down and then I take it in slow motion.
And then I speed it up. And take it fast like a nigga on a top speed coaster.
Now where my goons at?
Load em up. Take aim and we ready to attack.
And ain't no backing down.
We go pound for pound. Round for round. We knock em down.
Now if you think you got them hands. And nigga that's the plan.
I'ma knock yo ass down like the black Jackie chan.
The squad ain't loosing. These bitches keep choosing.
And that's why (ay, ay).

Let me get em. Man I gotta hit the flow.
Step into my fighting stand. And then I crank that Rambo.
Anyone can come and get it.
It's a war that I declare.
If you want a double duo. Then I bring out yogi-bear.
Watch us hit you left and right.
Combos coming once or twice.
We becoming stupid fast. Have yo whole clique scarred for life.
Flawless victory on deck.
But its time for round two.
Put my hands up on my hips,
Then I crank my Scooby-doo.

Hey, they love to see me move.
Me and my whole crew.
Cause every time I lean they watch spectators try to do it too.
So they keep on hesitating & hate, I put em in they place.
I call my boy Tookie then we whoop Rico in his face.
No time to conversate.
This ain?t the time or place. Watch me have to whoop a nigga ass
Like my name was Billy blanks.
This left a leave ya.
Then my dance, we crucial like brutality.
We leave y'all whole click stuck. Like we stole the damn scene.

[Trez]
They said em twice. Another third times a charm.
But why would you holla back, if a nigga in front of you ain?t no harm.
He tried to lean, he tried to rock, but he can?t do it quite like me.
Cause he keep doing the same ole move, constantly.
Now watch us kill this dance. Soon as we hit the flow.
Bout to get real crazy, don't turn yo head. We bout to start the show.
First you bend yo back, and lift yo head. Use yo hands and block yo head.
Roll yo arms and show yo swag. Now break his legs, arms, neck (yea).

She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Ought to see her rock 'n' roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat just skin and bone
But I love her, she loves me
All are happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
I told her mama and her papa too

Just exactly what I want to do
I want to get married on a night in June
And rock and roll by the light of a silvery moon
And I love her, she loves me
All are happy now we can be

Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin'

Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light

The broad path is getting trampled under my feet
The narrow way and the tiny ugly door
Is getting smaller and smaller
Too small for me

Open me up
Just like a vacuum sucking in the dirt
Put it all inside me, baby
Hear, speak, see and rise like leviathan
Armor plated, fire breathing

Yeah, I am
I am the empty, empty
Yeah, I am
I am the nothing in me

My will be done, done did it
Did the everything that leads to nothing
And breathing in the rotten stink
Feeling something, something leads to nothing
Breathe it in

Bat wings swathing my face
Screeching, singing something into me
The light, it flees
Open up the earth, my veins, my legs
My throat, my head, my soul is dead

Yeah, I am
I am the empty, empty
Yeah, I am
I am the nothing in me

Breaking down the walls that you leave up
To keep me from eating the tree of knowledge
Suck that fruit and spit the seed
Leave behind the sad and spineless

Part the sea and break apart the crust
Let me in the darkest tunnels at night
Let your spirit sag like a skin molting
Let it drop, shut out the ugly light

Yeah, I am
I am the empty, empty
Yeah, I am
I am the nothing in me

Yeah, I am
I am the empty, empty

Under the bluest skies where the angels cry.
I'm gone

consistently pushing themselves over the ledge

I remember when we first met and kissed.
I knew right away that you were for me.

The same sad chords and the same false start
The same fine music and the same hired cars
The same fat columns at the same bazaar
The same phone-call and the same dry bar
The same fast target and the same desire
The face this second shows the people we are

Work at home - the chemical way

WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE WE RESORT TO SINGING SONGS

The same mud collar and the same white bar
The same [blind corner/tight struggle] and the same late farce
The mirror's so lucky it sees what we are
The vascular bundle[s] and the jugular
The oblique direction[s] and the same way home
The same bad karma and the same hard body
The cake tastes solid and the milk goes sour
The skin gets sticky and the breath unsure

Work at home
Work at home - react to this thing
Work at home - reject your image
Work at home - embellish this fear
Assemble older people and their friends in here

The soulless show affectionate fear
The bad dead feelings seep into us now
We take hand, say obvious prayers
The taped heart starts from instinct
We all light fires on separate stairs
The consequence is theory until now
The arched back the elegant anger
The same hard stale reasons

Shuggie Otis,"I looked at you, girl, I saw a smile
For my love, you said you'd walk a mile
Today I see your face, you wear a frown
Now you're telling me that I'm a clown
What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought you'd act so strange

You say that I'm a boy and we should part
So you can go and make a brand new start
You laughed at me and then I almost cried
You hurt my heart so bad I had to hide
What's the reason for this sudden change?
I never thought that you would act so strange

I'm gettin' tired of listenin' to you talk
I think I'll go outside and take a walk
Took my guitar and got up off the floor
I must have dozed off while you were next door

I'm in a snake back situation
Here's a pencil pad
I'm gonna spread some information
You, making me happier
Now I am snappier, while I'm with you
I, got to be heavier
'Cause I am happier, when I make you
Oh, my little should phone ya
I get a dark blue ring
I get a snapback raincoat
I get a purple sting, ('cos he is in tune)

These are the whistlecat, (singing the hours)
Along the frosty roadside, (always in time)
I get a-nother ring, (making me happy)
That will take me for another ride, (up in the sky)

I found an eighty park system(?)

Out in the country fields smiling, (jumping, laughing, having fun)

Sorry people, but I'm not the one,
So I think I have to split a match and think about it,

Try callin' when you think that you found it,

Enjoyin' all the sides throughout the ride,
Led my cheer be my guide,
I'm seventy in, I wanna ride up the city,
Some Cristall clain here and I swear it's a pity

Just like a big daydream, in the middle of night,
Smooth jump and fun, as I heard of town,
Gone Sirk in the night

Shuggie Otis,"Hello my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind

In the garden, I see
West purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins
Dressed in green

Pretty music, I hear
So happy and loud
Blue flower echo
From a cherry cloud

Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you try to ask
""Is it cool?""

If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be with my baby
I am free, flying in her arms
Over the sea

Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite
With velvet roses diggin'
Freedom flight

Me in the heart, in the dark,
With the dart of the spark
When it hit.

Saw the thong, it was on.

Two days on the road
And you're still on my mind.

'cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke, so I'm tryin' to make
A hustle out of rhyme.
I gotta see the world one girl at a time,
But you're hangin' on my sleeve
Like I care that you're cryin'
And I do
I'm just tryin' to play it cool
I got a rep to protect,
Down at the high school.
Why you tryin' to cage me in
And when I leave we both know
That you'll be pagin' him
And when I come back
We gonn' do it again.
I promise we gonn' do it again.

Diamonds in my Shwayze chain.
Babies change,
They start showin' them fangs
Tryin' to take a ride on
Those crazy trains.
Choo choo.
What the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city
From here to Peru.
When I left you,
I signed my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed,
I'll be back soon.
Don't cry, I'll bust you
With a text soon.
I gotta go, but I'll
Be back next June.
Or July. Sparks in the sky.
She said, 'Boy you crazy.'
Nah, I'm Shwayze.

I met her at a backyard
Blockparty by the bar.
And she kept lookin' at me
Like she knew who I was.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me.
She was buzzin' all over me
Like she fell in love.

And I don't know what she was on.
Whatever it was, I want some.
She was buzzin' all over me.

Yo, at a party on the hill, I popped a pill
Threw back a shot and started to chill
Ran into a pretty thing named Jane Bang
She said she liked the way I handled my game,
I said thanks, I like the way you handle my thang
She said thanks, now thats money in the bank
So I walked away, towards the bar,
Bumped into a hottie named Holly in the hall,
Could've been a mange e toi,
But her friend never heard my music before
So I walked outside to get a little high,
When I got a little bump on my side from a fly
Blue-eyed baby with sex on the mind,
Sally's form the valley, but Sally's still fine
Hopped in the ride, and started to drive
She said ""Whats my name?"",
I said ""I dunno, Jane?""

I was smokin like cheech,
Scopin out a hot piece of ass I'm a creep,
Getting head while the radio speaks,
Popped like the bubble in these sneaks,
Yo Jennifer, or was it Monique,
That chick got dolphins tattoed on her feet
Last week, I seen a best friend
Undressin a Madison in the westend,
Exit, cut to breakfast,
Eggs benidict and a fresh pearl necklace
Legs in the air like a goddamn gymnast,
Please God, I beg for forgiveness,
Then she asked if I've been to Memphis,
I said no but Im a fan of Elvis,
Thats where I learned to move my pelvis,
She said ""Whats my name?"",
I said ""Jane?""

Pinnin every dome in Hollywood to the matress,

Knocked three times on the cadillac wood

Swallowed the benzodiazipan

I said politely eventhough it didn't sound right,
She said ""yeah right""
I said ""damn straight""

I got a blanky,
I'll lay it on the sand sand
I went deep like the God damn Grand Can,
Grand slam, bacon and the ham,
She was a fan that turned to a friend,
But now I think I love her since I took her to bed
She shook up my head,
Took all my time,
Spent all my money on diamonds and wine,

Poppin my collar potnah - who in the spot?

Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they ain't fucked me

That's why they suck dick with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at'cha; never leave you alone
Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in ""Love Jones""

From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin it up
And got all these hoes, givin it up

With a body that rides on sexual

Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch

Unsung hero's killed going through
In the shadow of the wall another one dares

Twenty five years of nightmares

It's a symbol of war (we don't want it)
Break it up (now)
Can't they see, there's no life behind closed doors

We'll go down fighting (breakdown the wall) repeat

Split either side, a city disgraced
When somebody dies it adds a brick in the wall
The bigger they are the harder they fall

It's to late now (Get what's coming)
Stand up (Now)

T'en souviens-tu baby? C'est de ma faute

Je vis avec mes souvenirs
D'une voix,d'un visage,d'un sourire
Et dire que je n'ai pas su t'aimer, non
Mais baby j'ai le blues de toi,le blues de toi
Je vis dans le regret
D'avoir tout abandonner
Et dire que je n'ai pas su t’écrire, non
Ce soir j'ai le blues de toi, le blues de toi

Me dire que peut être 
Tout ça ne sert a rien
Mes mots se perdront dans le vent
Et te dire que je regrette
Au moins, ça ma permis
De pouvoir penser à toi un instant

Je sais que je m'étais dit 
Que je t'oublierai
Mais je n'ai pas choisi d'y penser baby
De me voir pleine de regrets
C'est vrai qu'on s'était dit
Jamais l'un sans l'autre
Je m'en souviens baby, c'est de ma faute

Je vis avec mes souvenirs
D'une voix,d'un visage,d'un sourire

Shy'm,"Vous parler de ma vie
Vous dire à vous d’où je viens
Qui je suis
Je suis une femme de couleur

Je viens de là ou le soleil brille
Où les gens se parlent sans se connaître
Et vaincra même l'écho de la ville
Et les oiseaux chantent à la fenêtre
Le parfum de la liberté
L'enfant au visage métissé
Qui regarde son père
Pour voir comment faire
Des bons conseils
Qui feront de lui le grand frère
Le sable chaud qui réchauffe les cœurs
Tout simplement pour parler de bonheur
Ces mémoires qui redonnent le sourire
L'envie de vous chanter mes souvenirs

Vous parler de ma vie
Vous dire à vous d’où je viens

Je suis une femme de couleur
J'ai mon île au fond du cœur
Faut en parler, en parler

J'ai mon île au fond du cœur
Faut en parler, en parler

Je viens de là ou le soleil brille
Où les gens se parlent avec le cœur
Le vent des îles a fait de ma vie
Un océan de couleurs
Cultiver la différence
S'éloigner de l’intolérance
Affronter mes peurs en pensant
Aucun a la douceur en chantant
Le sable chaud qui réchauffe les cœurs
Tout simplement pour parler de bonheur

On à la nuit devant nous.

D'être la tienne dans le moindre de tes délires.

La chaleur de ton corps et tes bras
Qui m’entoure me donne envie de t'en demander encore

Combien nous l'ont déjà dit, on ne l'aurait jamais cru 
Mais je n'ai peur de rien quand je sens ton souffle fort 
Non je ne crains rien sous la chaleur de ton corps 
Dans le creux de tes bras, comme une enfant, je m'endors 
Je n'ai peur de rien, peur, peur de rien non 

Pas de beaux paysages, ni de crépuscule 
Je ne me vois que dans tes bras ce soir 
Pas les montagnes du Nord, ni les mers du Sud 
Je ne me vois nulle par ailleurs ce soir

Shy'm,"Ton regard sur moi
Tellement doux et chaud
Te sentir contre moi
Me fait perdre les mots
Savourer l'instant
Apprécier le moment
Penser au présent
Te caresser tendrement

Partons loin

Certains en rouge, en mémo
Des dates en vrac
Des soirs qui marquent
Où on s'est donné en cadeau
L'envie de toi, l'envie de nous
L'envie de partager
Ces moments seule
Où tard le soir à nous je rêvais
Aux moindres instants

Shy'm,"Paris sous un ciel gris, sombres soucis 
Tombée dans les bras d'une nuit d'Automne 
Qui se demande si je serai la même 
Quand j'en aurais fini avec ma peine 
Changer de décors me dirait où j'en suis 
Je me sentirais mieux aussi 
Changer d'air, un vent de réconfort 
Me permettrait d'y voir plus clair 
La force pour me refaire

Qui a maquillé mes peines 
Sous un sourire qui ne me quitte 
Que si 
Ce n'est plus la peine 
De chercher à se mentir à soi-même 
Il faut redoubler d'efforts pour leur montrer 
Qui je suis, aller au bout de mes envies 
Être celle qui se bat toujours plus fort 
Défendre mes idéaux à tous prix

Si les chemins ne se croisent plus, alors regardons les

Shy'm,"En apesanteur
Tout est plus beau de là-haut
Je pourrais y passer des heures
A tournoyer, planer comme un oiseau
En apesanteur
J'ai le cœur léger de te sentir sur ma peau
Le temps fait passer les heures, on est si bien
En apesanteur

Parfois seul regard suffit
Parfois de nulle part une image surgit
Et je m'empresse de te revoir
Je ne veux plus de nuit seule dans mon lit
Oh oh
Parfois une seule de tes caresses me suffit
A m'envoyer si haut dans ce coin de paradis
Où l'on se retrouve

Mais j'aimerais qu'elle traîne encore
Prisonnière de ce moment
Mais volontaire si l'on s'évade comme des amants

Shy'm,"Ton regard sur moi
Tellement doux et chaud
Te sentir contre moi
Me fait perdre les mots
Savourer l'instant
Apprécier le moment
Penser au présent
Te caresser tendrement

Oublions nos manies, nos habitudes
Partons loin
Laissons à la folie sa latitude
Ça me plaît bien
Oser comme personne n'ose
Abandonner la prose
Ne dis rien en silence
Au fond de la dernière danse

Tellement beau le souvenir
De nos premiers pas
Tellement chaud ton sourire
Quand tu me revois
Redessiner chaque jour
Comme si c'était le premier
La première fois
La première fois comme ça

Ton parfum sur moi
Me défile tant d'images
Mon carnet sur toi
N'a bientôt plus de pages
Trop de phrases, trop de mots
Certains en rouge, en mémo
Des dates en vrac
Des soirs qui marquent
Où on s'est donné en cadeau

L'envie de toi, l'envie de nous
L'envie de partager
Ces moments, seule
Où tard le soir à nous je rêvais
Aux moindres instants
La douceur des moments
Le désir intense
La mémoire d'une dernière danse

Tellement beau le souvenir
De nos premiers pas
Tellement chaud ton sourire

Shy'm,"J´habite seul avec maman
Dans un très vieil appartement rue Sarasate
J´ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue deux canaris et une chatte.
Pour laisser maman reposer
Très souvent je fais le marché et la cuisine
Je range, je lave, j´essuie,
A l´occasion je pique aussi à la machine.
Le travail ne me fait pas peur
Je suis un peu décorateur un peu styliste
Mais mon vrai métier c´est la nuit.
Je l´exerce en travesti, je suis artiste.
Jai un numéro très spécial
Qui finit en nu intégral après strip-tease,
Et dans la salle je vois que
Les mâles n´en croient pas leurs yeux.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

Vers les trois heures du matin
On va manger entre copains de tous les sexes
Dans un quelconque bar-tabac
Et là on s´en donne à cœur joie et sans complexe
On déballe des vérités
Sur des gens qu´on a dans le nez, on les lapide.
Mais on fait ça avec humour
Enrobé dans des calembours mouillés d´acide
On rencontre des attardés
Qui pour épater leurs tablées marchent et ondulent
Singeant ce qu´ils croient être nous
Et se couvrent, les pauvres fous, de ridicule
Ça gesticule et parle fort.
Ça joue les divas, les ténors de la bêtise.
Moi les lazzi, les quolibets
Me laissent froid puisque c´est vrai.
Je suis un homo comme ils disent.

A l´heure où naît un jour nouveau
Je rentre retrouver mon lot de solitude.
J´ôte mes cils et mes cheveux
Comme un pauvre clown malheureux de lassitude.
Je me couche mais ne dors pas
Je pense à mes amours sans joie si dérisoires.
A ce garçon beau comme un Dieu
Qui sans rien faire a mis le feu à ma mémoire.
Ma bouche n´osera jamais
Lui avouer mon doux secret mon tendre drame
Car l´objet de tous mes tourments
Passe le plus clair de son temps au lit des femmes
Nul n´a le droit en vérité
De me blâmer de me juger et je précise
Que c´est bien la nature qui
Est seule responsable si
Je suis un ""homme oh"" comme ils disent.",Comme Ils Disent

Si tu savais ce que je vis
Tous les jours toutes les nuits
Déchirée par un vent de peine
Je sais que je t'ai fait mal, mais j'ai mal aussi
J'ai dû tourner le dos à l'homme que j'aime
Je voudrais tant te garder que pour moi
Pouvoir encore te serrer contre moi

They're just out there doin it
They're just out there doin it and they don't really give a damn what's 
happenin
(And lil shorty with the .38 could pop you and jet- Guru 2X)

[Shyheim]
We was chillin on the ave buggin out lookin dap
And these 4 cold boys rolled up in a cab
They pulled out a tool said get against the wall
Fuck that, rather brawl then go out at all
My man pushed back, body pulled the trigger
Nah G, not Amsin, that's my main nigga
His body hit the floor, blood covered the ground
How that sound? I didn't even give my last pound
The red glare with these tears made me shed
Now I'm fed
My right hand man could be dead
Hell no, I couldn't let him flee that ain't me
Or have me and my crew lounge in peace
So we dash, put the gladiatior on that ass in the grass
His life is now come to pass
The fear made him shrimp, aw shit the gun slipped
My man picked up the burner and emptied the clip
In his back, no slack jack it's time to retreat back
Wipe the gat and pack it in the napsack
Yo be out, cause 5.0 is soon to come
And get arrested and bagged for murder one

Chorus:
(And lil shorty with the .38 could pop you and jet)
(And lil shorty with the .38 could pop you and jet)

I know a kid named Dane, he had mad fame
In the drug game, throwin his life down the drain
He slang mad rocks on the block til it got hot
Then he hit the jackpot, now he owns a crackspot
He always got blunted, smoked up the Philly
Now he use White Owl minks with his illy
Props, had lots and girls around his finger
The neighborhood banger and the hot rock slinger
The cops is on his back, left, right, right and left
He had a plan that was def so he stepped
He stuck up Bill, the one from up the hill that was chill
Now Bill wants to kill Dane dead
For his name and his fame so he did
He lit up the kid with lead in his head
Now Dane's dead

Chorus

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on down the block
Pack up, load the gats now my whole crew's strapped, what!
Bring the drama, Shaolin against all ya
My crew's in here deep ready to bomb ya
I got the ill rhymes, nigga's lookin for a show
But it's gettin kinda hectic on the mad down low
Honies with the big butts whine to get stuck
And they kill a bitch and it's time to get bucked
Boom baow, niggas want to drop cause it's real hot
And some knucklehead wants to blow up the spot
Pulls out a gat or burner he's the man
Except he ain't down with the Clan check the plan
Shorty's backed up cause we're true to the crew
Doin what we gotta do with a 40 ounce of Wu
Crashed to the head, 2 seconds from bein dead
And it stopped, when these 2 kids busted shots
The party's in a smash and the Wu got it locked up
It's it, the man on the mic is a props

Shyheim,"Intro:
This Bob Billiard for the Entertainment News
In the news today yoth rapper Shyheim AKA the Rugged Child 
is rapidly climbing the charts and making a lot of noise
Shyheim seems to be one of those little boy rappers
Who are making a lot of money.
Personally I don't think a little boy should get paid

Verse One:

Don't call me boy! (why?) Haven't you heard? 
Boy ain't nothin' but a white man's word
As the old saying go- I could never forget. Boy plays a tarzan g-tuck quit
So call me Shy with the Ooh la la la
Kissin' young girls and i makes them hollar
Fortan can never be an orphan. New Yorkin' Wu-slang talkin'
So hump the mile as I walk the mile
The little rascal's bucked un-juvenile. I be the captain of dappin' of
rappin'
How you scatchin' the cuts and the scratchin'
Not your average shorty 140 on the block
I got more props than your 1,000 cops
Stop! In the name of me. Like Denise Williams I gots to be free
To do what I want to do. Oh Shaboo
Here come the Little Rascals

Chorus:
One little two little three little rascals
Four little five little six little rascals
Seven little eight nine little rascals
Ten rugged rascals in all

Verse Two:

Gotta make a record to gain recognition, or competition
My posse is blitzin': I yell hooray! When they cross the barricade
Fuck the arcade- No games are being played
Sneaky little Shy from the streets of Staten
Somethin' shot me and my cousin cry Jason
Jason Jason- time for chasi' -girls
I'm on every case like Perry Mason
Step in they face and beg them for they number
Get the seven digits and now they like the roadrunner
Beep! Beep! Yo, things is gettin' deep. Takin' old does and coffee
There's no time to sleep. A tazmanian walkin' maniac
A young girl playing rap brainiac
So pump up the volume. For 10 balls you could have the whole album
Of the rugged- Child- Chi- Chi- Chi- Bow!!

That's a big bad motherfucka comin your way

[Intro: Shyheim (Pop Da Brown Hornet)]
One two one two one two one two
(Hey yo Shyheim wassup baby
There be a lot of shorties out here rockin the mic
For like one or two singles but they don't keep comin at em baby
You got to come non-stop like consecutive blows to the head dome
Gotta keep em movin non-stop, gotta keep em movin, that's all I got to tell 
you
Just keep em movin)

[Shyheim]
Hey yo what's goin on
Nowadays brothers keep testin me
Tryin to get me open and take out the best of me
They pull up rough, get snuffed, and then bust
When I kick that old underground funk stuff
That's comin atcha, better run from the rapture
Before I gat'cha I'm buckin shots atcha
Buck-buck-buck means you punks better duck
Kid you're outta luck, try to flip you get stuck
By the Wu-Tang sword, oh lord you shoulda bucked south
I'm spittin out on brothers straight from my mouth
You just been ripped now watch your blood drip
Right down your lip and then I'm ghost in my whip
Take a sip I'm the candyman, I got sweets
For all the sweet MCs that fake funk in the streets

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Gots to keep em movin baby)
Gotta move it over here
(Non-stop, non-stop like this)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I said I wasn't gonna say no more but I got a little bit more to say)
Gotta move it over here
(Shyheim you gotta keep em movin baby gotta keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(They can't fuck with you)

[Shyheim]
Up comes a shorty, sneaky one
Armed with the loaded gun, shit's on lock til I'm done
Bad little bastard I'm a rugged child classic
How could you ask it when you know that I rips it
Check how the Shy flips his tongue like a pro
Fifteen years old with nuff skills to flow
Props, damn right kid, you know I got lots
If rockin hip-hop was a crime call the cops
Become a wanted man who was forced to be a fugitive
A shorty outta Shaolin Isle with somethin new to give
You want to hear it? It goes a little somethin like this
The Wu-Tang click is comin thick
If I must be the setter then I'ma have to set it
Forget it, that's your last buck don't even bet it
If it's rough then it's right and I'm never goin left
I'm not a comedy but my jams pack mad def
My napsack's full with mad goodies
My click keeps a low profile with black hoodies
You want to see me flop, well how can you figure
Cause bein rough and rugged's doin well for a nigga

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo move em over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo I don't care where you move em just keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That's all I want you to do baby, hah)

[Shyheim]
Back in the flesh it's the want to get buckwild
From Staten Isle it's the return of the rugged child
I'm no pimp but I walk with a slick limp
And I catch a dunk off the funk like Shawn Kemp
I be the beat of the rugged rhyme freaker
To blow out your speaker, got more soul than sneakers
I swing the parties with the tunes that I hit, many bit
But then I zipped up that lip quick
I keep it smashed when they dash for my cash they get blast
And slapped on that ass real fast
I'm supposed to be the best when they flex
Don't get vexed, just put that mess right to rest
I'm an enemy cause my style is not public
Don't dub it cause my flow is masteredly rugged

[Sample] (Pop Da Brown Hornet)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo when I hear this jam right here I know Shy is tellin me keep em movin)
Gotta move it over here
(That means if I gotta pull a biscuit out your head and tell you)
Gotta move it over here
(To get off the wall that's what I'ma tell ya)
Gotta move it over here
(Cause he's comin hardcore for ya, unh unh)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo like over here Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo, yo keep em movin Shy)
Gotta move it over here
(Yo keep em movin yo, yo keep em movin",Move It Over Here
Shyheim,"Chorus 2X:
Napsack on my back
Napsack on my back
Napsack on my back
(I carry a full pack)

[Shyheim]
I rocks the blocks with the rugged hip-hop
And I can't be stopped cause my jam pumps like Reebok
Go get a grip as I flip the bic
Don't slip cause I rip shit and I'll packs a biscuit
So make em jump jump cause I gotta pump pump
I'll stick it in your gut and see who jumps up
So tell me now do you think you can hang
With the Wu (Wu) Tang (Tang) boom (boom) bang bang
Crunch that blast up the trunk of a punk
With the funk that gots em doin the drunken monk
On the Shaolin beatbox cause I rocks steady
Don't sweat me cause I get crazy like Eddie
Boom-bah, some say I am a superstar
Tell em all I am what I am baby paw
And my beats, fatter than fat, they're not funny
Cause these drums remind me of One's 4 Da Money
Now tell me that me and are can't drop hits
Then you heard it but then you tried to rhyme and got dissed
My style, my flow for real will have you chumped
And I get like Ziggy and toss it up

Chorus 4X

[Shyheim]
My styles is dope so call the kid dynamite
I writes the rhymes that's redder than bloodsight
A trail of thunder with rugged hardcore
When I rips the crowd the dancefloor gets sore
I laid down my game with my shade and razor cane
I laid down my game and parlayed with my gang
A little rascal was a bad little bastard
(So you're the rugged child) I see you're learnin fast kid
Get the message I rapped several texts
So don't even try to step to this with that old bullshit
On how you better me and how you could do me
Come on son, cause you know my style is groovy
To the max as I watch and give a beatin
And I got more bats in me than Michael Keaton

Chorus 4X

[Shyheim]
I'm kickin master Wu-Tang slang cause I'm a slinger
I got a magic grip so you could call me Golden Fingers
I'm rough and I'm tough but I keep it on profile
want to peep my style take a ride to the Isle
I'll meet you on the other side, we'll take ya dollar man
To prove to my fans that I really am the man
The hardcore shorty that will keep ya head boppin
And while I keep rockin your ears will start poppin
To that freaky flow and all that old good shit
And not to be conceited but hey, the shoe fits
Gimme room, I love to hear the next competition
So I can prepare to give another ass whippin
Short sneaky Shy-Shy the kid with the props
I'll make your heart stop at the pop of a glock
A Tech-9, an uzi, so what can you do me?
But take his advice be the next one to sweat me

Chorus 4X",Napsack
Shyheim,"Nowadays you gotsta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin how to act
They always pull the glock when somebody rocks at night
And if they get shot they offer shit should the cops
Now tell me this ain't livin foul
She just had a baby child and she's back to sellin cracks valve's
On the Ave cause she's addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip don't want to listen cause she's in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck 
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then committed suicide

Chorus:

Hey Yo, this goes on it don't stop
Everybody's doin' their own thing
From hooker in the drug slang (repeat 2)

Times is gettin' hard, word is bond, I sware God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born tebba, A rebel without a pause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that want to be down
So they get a glock a lick shots to get props
And win shit rocks so you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by da homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live anotha day

Chorus

Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects 
Pulled his nuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggaz in hoodiez packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

Chorus

And be dropping mad skillz like my name was Pad Mark
The rebel to society

Loking at me strange leave dim raid it'll mase me
Had I did something wrong go and my dumb

To make it real snappy, and little nasty-nasty

You had you're chans but you feld out on tune,
So you're hanging out with deuce, now you say that rock rues

Go-go, ga-ga, now you want me popa
I'm not a mack daddy or my daddy mack
Touch my napsack, boy you gettin' pitch smack
I've got a style may not be formilliar
It's like both way you're callin' round in a cosha
Who will be the next to flex and face death
ashes to ashes, and only dust is left

One's for the money

Shyheim,"Chorus 7X: sample
Soon as the bass kick

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on 5c-75
Everyone's gonna be there I bet it be live
Ran home mad quick jumped in the tub real fast
Condition my hair, put on cologne at last
Iron my pants with my blue jean jacket
Put on socks black tops with a hat and three packets
Clipped my key to my pants, my dough in my right pocket
Fly lookin dip can't get even smoke a brain spark it
Take a bus now, I call up Newport cab
Pay up front says the driver cause he almost got stabbed
Pay my fee real quick, jumped out the cab real fast
Cut through the alley, oh shit I almost bust my ass
Ran up the stairs and just look what I see
Crazy dope cuties just starin at me
Put on my chump chain with my lucky go getter
They're whisperin and laughin ""Uh huh he's a winner""
Feelin dope, like I never did before
Umm, thought for a second and I stepped to the door
Knocked three times before someone had opened
They said ""Yo look at shorty yo he must've been smokin""
Shut the door on my face, the girls they say ""Don't worry""
I said ""Damn, I'm still ranked as a shorty""

Chorus 8X

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on are you with me
Before you pay your loot make sure it's not empty
Cause many people be schemin for a buck
Watch out, pray for luck that you won't get stuck
By a mob or a crew or a Clan but if it's one man
Let the shit hit the fan
Cause ain't no way in this world I'm playin pussy
Niggaz better try to kill and ambush me
Blow for blow, hit for hit money quit
Before I have to do some old wild crazy shit
So I take the live and put it with the raw
And score and draw mad blood from a whore
Then I burn an MC up like a burnt english muffin
Brothers always puffin in but ain't sayin nuthin
To a smooth brother Shy on the slippery script
For me to flip up and kick like a kung-fu flick
Polish MCs like Griff and offer up an alibi
High like Tone-Loc keep you horny like Spanish Fly
Clip up a whole new click with Mr. Clean
If that don't do it I get on the reverend Visine
And still come off on the top so you drop
Now I rock the parties non-stop
Hickory dickory tickle me - stop
Shyheim came to rock this spot
Hands in the air as you dance to this jam
In command hot damn the kid who slams
Up a party and steals like to star G
Used to body but now I'm pumpin hotties

Outro: samples
There's a party over here
Party over here
There's a party over here

There's a party over here (All that, all that youknowI'msayin)

Shyheim,"""Here comes the rugged one"" [Repeat: x4]

[Prophet]
Well I'm that ill shitty kid
They call the Prof Nitty kid
I'm one motherfucking ill crazy inner city kid
(What!) Step the fuck back then relax
Rough is on a full scale attack black
Huh, I'm packing a full metal jacket
A bat, 21 guns and a hatchet
What's that? Some ill shit kid you can't match it
Don't even try to meet it cause you can't fucking catch it
(Aww fuck!) Baby you're shit outta luck
Cause I'm crazy, maybe it's best that you duck
Got the shit I can't hide, some call it animus
It burns deep inside and that's how I get heated
When I see the likes of you that's the only time I need it
Remember last meeting, I left my knuckles bleeding
Now my palms are bloody cause I'm counting blood money
That I rob from your man in the land of milk and honey
You can't do me none son when I smoke my Meth
I feel no pain, no death, so what the fuck is left
You see me meditate well then you see me in my home
Way deep inside my dome that's the place where I roam
Where knowledge and the wisdom, understanding of the lord
Is stored, if you're lured everybody grab your sword
If I live by the sword then I die by the sword
I'll die by the sword I swear to the fucking lord
Cause I'm taking niggas out like you never saw
See my sword is my tongue that's how I get the job done
I still grab my gun cause I'm a fucking rugged one

[Chorus: x2]
We came to rock (What)
We came to rip (What)
And with the rugged styles yo bust the way we flip it

[Shyheim]
Now here we go again another brother catching heart
Ain't that some shit I gotta rip him apart
Too many MC's fake funk claiming raw
You better hit floors soon as I declare war
Coming straight at cha, better run quick from a click
That's sick with a bunch of lunatics
For those who slept I want your rep want to bet
Today'll be your day of regret
Cause the Rugged Child is coming to town
To find a whole ground that can get beat down
Huh, how you like me now I get down for my crown
With a fat sound that shakes from the underground

[June Lova]
Bringing ruckus to a nigga, quick to pull the trigger real fast
Try to test me, buck buck buck on that ass
I don't fake none
When I pull out I'm down to take one's life
I'm trife so watch what you say son
Just came from up north catching flashbacks
Brothers doing that same old shit
I planned on chilling when I got home
But now it's like I'm all alone cause everybody's playing Al Capone
No one to stay positive with
Everybody's selling drugs and all that good shit
So I parlay on the forcing tip
The studio is where you'll find me just like back in 1990
But Joe, everywhere I go is like June how you been
Sorry I couldn't come to see you when you were in
Yeah, my man save all that bullshit
Cause if you really cared you wouldn'ta came to see a nigga quit
Word is bond, that's how I kicked it
No disrespect intended, don't get offended
I had to learn the hard way that there is no friends
How many of us have them
When shit gets real everybody's on the run
So niggas watch a back, here I come, here I come

[Chorus: x4]

[Quasi]
It was a cold day in hell when they all heard the word
Everybody's eyes swelled and all the heads turned
It went ""The ill killer and the shitty Prof Nitty
Was fucking blowing up spots all over the city""
And everybody cheered ""There a party over here!""
Trying to get our attention, but really need I mention
That my mind was set upon a most highest intention
For me to praise his name that's the reason why I came
That's the motherfucking name so don't ask the same question twice
Like who's the motherfucking real Christ
I already told ya once I'm too fucking nice
So I'll tell you again, it's Allah see who descend
From the root of David to the line of Solomon
All the way down to the motherfucking end so uhh
You and your friends just get on down
I ain't talking about dancing, face the fucking ground
Hands upon your head kid do as I said
Kid it's too late you're dead, good fucking riddance
And if I get bagged I'ma do the life sentence
So I'm out on a lam, don't tell 'em where I am
Even though I got the hearts and the smarts
To rip the shit to shambles
Just like the Huns and the vandals
Yo I'm the one more souped up than Campbells
Why? Cause I got the gats good and plenty
For the 1-2-2 you and the 120
So go and bring your crew if you want to get done
By the true and the Wu, cause here come the rugged onez

[Chorus: x4]",The Rugged Onez
Shyheim,"[Chorus]
(You the man Shy) I disagree baby paw
You the man K (Who me? Uh-huh no way
You the man Shy) Nah you the rah-rah star
You the man K (Yeah but you can rip it the right way)

[Shyheim] (Down Low Recka)
Well okay if you say so I will be the man
But all I want to do is make my record just slam
I want to be the kid to make the real live single
To make the party people in the crowd shake and mingle

(Yeah well Shy you can do that with ease real simple)
True cause I'm the shorty from the Wu-Tang temple
But I can't sleep you get the girls and the cash
(Yeah yeah but you're the one that got the shorties in the smash)

Take one (take two) We comin through for your crew
(Who are you?) Talkin about you man (you can't Wu)
But you front, you all out punks on the hunt for some beats
To make your next LP complete

(Here we come) To make the crowd scream for the Clan
One by one (Takin out your crew cause we can
Get the gun) Better yet a knife what the heck
The job gets done (When we chop the head from the neck)

Since I'm short they have no other choice but to sleep underneath
The blow that be knockin out teeth
(I be the K, The Down Low Recka on the set I gets wreck
I make the calm sweat want to bet)

[Chorus]

[Down Low Recka]
So wassup better duck from my ill megablast
You move too fast and your ass is in the smash
The Down Low Recka, shit I rock full clip
In my glock gets hot so stay off my block

I come down hard on cornballs who sleep talk
'Cause you won't survive in New York
I flow a mad thick like the sap from a tree
I'm of the live brothers represents G.P.

I'm hot like the sun, find shade I got my rays on ya
Come near to raid my sphere and I'ma lay for ya
I see ya comin with attempts to Bougard
Peek-a-boo you ain't hard I pulled your whole card

I got flavor, you're damn right I gots style
Nine yards, nah the K goes the whole mile
Whoever said I wasn't ill with the skill
One minute I parlay, the next I'm all in your grill

[Shyheim] (Down Low Recka)
Back up, gimme some room so I can flip this
You touch this, come on, and get your style busted
You lay around and watch me break the mic stand
You should know by now that I am the man

Comin through, takin my place yeah you all know
That I can't be touched by a crew or any solo
Who dares to step to this kid and his Clan
(Aww damn) Another crew done by the hand

Of the Shy (What you do kid) I did him prop
(Where's the payphone) Hell yeah, somebody call the cops
When me and K grease somebody do somethin
Stop bluffin and frontin cause you ain't sayin nuthin

You're lyin, claimin that you rip shop up
You ain't heard it from me cause I ain't one to gossip

Shyheim,"Haaaaaa, and it don't stop and it don't stop
Rugged Child got the world prop nigga
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
(Do I gotta cock my pistol?)

[Shyheim]
I be notorious like that nigga Big Smalls
Plus I keep it raw live illegal like Jamal
If ya act up you get shot up
What the blood? I represent thugs (you know it)
y'all know my style, bring it to man, woman and child
Buckwild juvenile (Rugged Child break it down)
Jiggers they stick close like crews
You never see me spendin cash rules on you fools
Cause I don't love you hoes (why not)
A lot of y'all cross be laws like Got
A nigga like me keep it real, word to Jesus
Respect to the real woman, fuck you skeezers

Chorus: (2x)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
(Or do I gotta cock my pistol?)

I'm a juvenile deliquent, I keeps a cocked biscuit
Moet and Alize be gettin a nigga lifted
And when I'm high my mouth is dry
I'm not from the sky
But a nigga for the eye he better do or die
Clack-clack, that's all you hear up in the dark
Blaka-blaka, and then two bright sparks
The boy fall down while screamin police
WOOO jiggy comin, but them no worry me see
A criminal for bein crimi-nal
No matter who, what, how, when or where it goes down
A dramalord plus a punany don
In '95 I'ma max like Nissan
I'ma max, get it, max, I'ma, Max-ima, well come along
I take you through another Chamber, let me pick
36 Wu-Tang? Yeah that be that shit

Chorus

So I creep ooohhhhhh I roll deep like F.O.I.'s
Recognize or get paralyzed
I drop jewels like a nervous appraiser
A hell raiser, engrave my logo in your back player
I bring the pain in many different methods
Similar to the lethal injection and your style is seconds
What punk, boy I'll box ya up
Plus my rhymes is sicker than them kids in Somalia

Chorus",Can You Feel It
Shyheim,"Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm working out in this world that you made G
Homicide rapes and robberies
When it happens in my neighbourhood police they look for me
I'm the prime suspect in the projects
I got this fucked up rep that keeps me behind a step
Always broke so I got this attitude
In my lab never fool my man, this is crazy rude
Gyros and pizza, be my lunch and dinner
I know that I'm a sinner, but God help me out nigga
I got problems that only death could solve
A high school drop out, and my GED won't get me no job
My family be calling me a loser
Moms she's a boozer, got me livin' life with no future
The only thing that keeps me strivin' is rhymin' and uhh
Bump 'n' grindin', besides that I feel like dying

Word to my peoples in the essence
I send my blessings
I know you gone, but it might be for the best
'Cause life is full of stress
And the projects you won't progress
God, fuck the world, it's a mess

[Chorus:] 
Pop Da Brown Hornet
Dear, God, as I look into the sky
I pray to you, and I, wonder why
I wonder why things be the way they are
So until then I pray for that it ends tomorrow

I'm in another world lookin' from the outside in
A corrupt planet, operating strictly off sin
You ask me will I miss this joint when I pass
The world can kiss my ass, I'm staring at the hour glass
Every day lived, is a step towards death
It's not 'til you're dead that your body's at rest
A funeral should be a celebration, everyone embracin'
This song'll be my dedication, unto
The Two Cent S, my cousin Duana, and Case
Rest in peace no one can ever take your place
The pain is eternal

No one to turn to when I sit and think about you
No longer in the physical, dealing with your spiritual essence
You're gone but we still feel your presence
Nothing can bring you back, black
Still and all it's just a fact that you gone
Dive I intox on the bar, a dagger in the heart
For every lifeforce that gets a brand new start
It's the harsh reality you're forced to deal with
Another family hit crawling in a endless pit
Of sorrow, no one's promised tomorrow

[Chorus x 2]

(It seems like the good times versus the bad times)
Yo I barely go to school 'cause crime be on my mind
Fuck local hits to leakers that's all in the past
And I'm livin' for the future, gotta make the great cash
(Slow down shorty, goodness come to those that wait
If you move too fast I might be going to your wake)
True indeed, but I got mouths to feed
Members of my family upstate in need for commisary
And if you stressin' me, gettin' the, best of me
So it seems like life is my worst enemy
(Don't let it get to you, Shy
Life is what you make it, you can't escape it
Play you like a bitch and just take it)

Hell no, 'cause when I'm goin', I'm goin' out with style
With two macs going to war with the other side of town
Ain't nuttin' sweet about me, Pop let them niggaz know
I'm countin' blood money, 'cause I'm a thug honey
I use the world as my zoo, I ain't no fuckin' dummy
I'm street smart, I tear a college grad apart
(I gets amped when I think about the slave camps
I feel the pain, use a Tec-9 to brake away the chain)
Yo calm down big fella everything gonna be aight
Go looki' for them blues you got a nigga want to do right
(Don't sweat it, just play the game of life at your best
Life is full of stress and in the projects you won't progress
Shy fuck the world it's a mess)
Yeah aight

[Chorus x 2]",Dear God

so sleep late at night most nights I didn't even sleep,

Wet my throat rockin the trenchcoat, flashin to get mine
Not hesitant, 'cause the Henny keeps me bent
Just tryin to make a cent, diggin pockets down to the lint
Regardless of all the charges the D's want me for
Warrant after warrant, so I avoid the law
Stapleton on the rise, twenty-seven wearin lives
From day one until they none don't take it as no surprise

[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Shyheim]
I'm havin suicidal thoughts cause I'm screwed up in the game
But today's thang, is to hold it down and maintain
I got thirty days until I get remanded for this gun charge
Still I'm livin large, joint hard up in the mode and
long sexin, fishin for pre-model
I'm young black rich and dangerous, livin like I won the lotto
So nuff of wine sex and dutches
Them kids know who us is
GP rule, hundred-twenty-seven hustlers
Runnin from D's when they try to bust us
Fly crims and gats, mainly black cops, them faggots love us
And my district attorneys want to send me to jail
I told em, ""People want to kill me"", that's why I had the nine milli
I'm bustin dead and not to injure
Remember what I quote
Before you, enter my center

[Chorus]",Shaolin Style

Where all my niggaz at?
We up in here, what?

Crim-criminals in the penile
Where ya at? 
Cats sacking green

[Chorus:]
It be real when I pack a steel
Every man for himself, send my love to a battlefield
Ain't no wack, it's a straight up fact
Or dip down in black once you hear the clap clap

Shit is real, ain't no time to cash no butterflies
Pass the St. Ide's
Screwface is my disguise so look me in my eyes that ain't wise
The first chump that jumps is the first chump that dies
Raw, spell that backward that's war
Lay low scarecrow, I'm knockin at your front door
Pointin' a pistol to your peekhole, pussy
Warning, my trigga finga gets busy
Blaow, a single shot straight to the headpiece
Decrease the peace and watch the murders increase
See I'm ruthless, pistol whip a nigga toothless
Me gettin' hit that shit is ludacris
I'm on my P's and my Q's
Try to put your foot in my shoes kid, you gotta pay the fuckin' dues
I ain't the one to play Pammy
I leave the head all red like that little orphan Annie
I'm dressed in black like Streets of Harlem
Paddle punk's pockets down with no problem
And get away just like an Unsolved Mystery
You don't believe me G, check my pedigree
And you can feel how I deal with the muthafuckin' steel
Ain't no game boy, it's real

[Chorus x 2]

Shit is real, I'm in some real shit
Niggaz wet up the lab, Ma Dukes got hit
Now they knew I was trying to give 'em what I owe 'em
But now I gotta act like I don't know 'em
The muthafuckers violated to the fullest degree
They did it smart, now they gotta see me
And I'ma flip like an acrobat, to give them bastards back
And let them know where my head is at
I pack a cannon, I know where them thugs be standin'
Near the stores, with them Hip Hop whores
And there I was all dipped and fatigued
Goin' Rambo, G.I. Joe of a dolo
Droppin' bodies, bodies they was droppin' 
Like rain from a blackman that went insane
They dissed my Earth I had to diss they whole universe
Blew up the block, stepped back and watched it burst
Niggaz was runnin', I was steady gunnin' em down
They hittin' the ground from the impact of the four pound
Some kids tried to dip in the whip, I emptied the clip 
And watched a car do a fuckin' flip
Reloaded at the same time the car exploded
Spotted a Gangsta Bitch, told her to hold it
It only took five secs for she squealed, ""Blaka, Blaka!""
Two shots to the twat, shit is real

[Chorus x 2]",Shit Iz Real
Shyheim,"Hah, oh word up, this is one of them
yo let me tell ya son
this one of them gettin dick sucked type tracks
I'm tellin you, in the closests or where check it out

Verse One:

What up boo, how life treatin ya girl
Hopefully you're takin care of yourself out in the world
As for me, I'm mainting in this packed hell hole
Hopefully in the year 2000 Big Kane'll be home
My old school crew frontin on me cept for a few
It's a shame that jail had to make me feel the way I do
But it's all good, enough for me what's up wit you
You don't write or come and visit me like you used to
What's the problem huh Why all of a sudden you dissapearin
Now that I need you the most you actin like you don't care and
It hurts my feelins but life must continue
I heard that Big Mark died please don't say this shit is true
If so that's fucked up oh tell my niggaz what's up
And don't get caught up in no bullshit and get sicked up
How is my seeds doin I know they're crazy big by now
Tell 'em daddy loves 'em no matter what the fuck goes down
And Love Dark ha, he's a dead man walkin for talkin
To Jiggy Jake I'm puttin him in a coffin
Ay yo I'm vexed so Ima end this little letta
So take care of yourself for worst or for fuckin betta

Are you still there for me baby I need to know
You're one of the only things I got in this whole wide world
You're my whole wide world
(repeat)

Verse Two:

All I do is party and bullshit
Fuck big chicks that's mad thick
Roll through the big city
In BM's and Cruiser Land's
But damn, it ain't the same without my fam
You niggaz understand
On New Years I drink beers and bust off heat
I'm in this little street doin by any means to eat
You gotta get up get out and rob suntin
Ha don't let dem niggaz with that cream walk by that's right
I be shootin and stabbin, robbin niggaz whateva
For gold chains, rings, watches, diamond studs and leathaz
My peoples one love ya'll stay bugged
Don't crimp your style none cause we thugs..foreva

Are you still there for me homiez I need to know
You're really the only thing I got in this whole wide world
You're my whole wide world
(repeat)

(My cousin Tawana, rest in peace girl, you're my whole wide world)

I need somebody there when it's hard kid oh yeah yeah
When they bring the ruckus to me
You're my whole wide world",Still There
Shyheim,"[Shyheim]
""Sup, how was your ride.""
""It was long, but I'm aiiight.""
""True, true.""
""So you takin care of yourself in here?""
""No question, I gets down for mines.""
""Yeah I know, I heard a lot about you.""
""Word? I'm sayin tho-""
""Anyway, if you don't mind me askin, how'd you get into alla this?""
""Yo, it's a long story...""

I started off light, knockin off y'all packs for this kid Pat
He told me to take 30 and bring him the rest back
It didn't take long for my clientele to swell
Snitches started to tell, broke niggas was jail
Cause they couldn't outhustle me so they tried to muscle me
But I ain't pussy y'all I leave em dead like a Kennedy
Took a half a year to get a half a brick
My own shit, now I make profit on every flip
No more hand-to-hands, I'm the big man now
Push a black Land Cruiser, pack a chrome trey-pound now
I'm smellin all the animos in the air
Pat spreadin rumors that he gonna take me outta here
What the fuck the bloodclot thinkin
My plan's to roll up in an old black Lincoln and leave him dead and stinkin
And I'm a man of my word, word
I seen him on the curb smokin herb
I made the Continental swerve
And hopped out and started lettin off shots
And didn't stop until I seen his body drop
Then a nigga like me just skated
I know he was packin steel, that made it drug-related
YouknowI'msayin

Chorus: (2x)
Things happen so keep your eyes open
Sheisty ones be scopin
That's why guns we be totin
Things happen so keep your eyes open
Sheisty ones be scopin

I'm on the run from po-po
Some crab niggas pulled the bitch move
My blood pressure's high but I play it calm and smooth
Everybody's my enemy, can't trust no one
The last time I trust a trust I almost got done
So keep your eyes open and beware of the ruckus
Cause life ain't nothin but thirsty, grity muthafuckers
I ran with niggas that will kill ya warm dead
Keep it real is who I pumped into them niggas little heads
My granddad, he used to call me Killer now I am
Everybody where I used to chill, fuck them
My mind was playin tricks on me shorty
Once I was like ""Turn yourself in and do the time"" (yo fuck that)
The pigs wanted five, tell my moms I love her
And stay strong and don't fall
I'm in the hands of the Lord

Yo son 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, chickenheads will get done 
You the first man, you go first son 

I'm Mobb Deep, in cherry Cherokees I forever be 
On some thug shit, runnin' wild through New York City 
Bustin' guns rockin' jew-els that shine like sun 
Stapleton is where I'm from 
And been down for years stayed on point like stairs (yeah, word up) 
Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner 
And squeeze, if I get front on my nine millimi 
Will have my enemies, behind trees 
Niggaz that think they live 'cause they puff a little lye 
Pack a bullshit, twenty-five, nah don't think they'll kill us

Older cats mack, roll with young godz that got the guns 
You right about that kid 
Out of town Big Willie niggaz best to run 
Now yo y'all just keep everything moving you know

The beat is sounding like Star Trek 
Of the young Shaolin Monks, taking heads, with the tongue 
So yo, youknowhatI'msayin son? 

Yo, deep in the ocean of the Atlantic, here comes the killa falcon 
I meditate then swing with the force of mountains 
Brain cells is able to be bi-debatable 
When I think it's hazardous to your ozone layer 
A premeditated killer plan so kill the Mayor, my silencer 
Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels 
I live by name and cut veins 
Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans 
And become the Allied commander, my enemies is catching on camera 
They seek death, I begin to torture them (calm down kid take your time) 
By giving butterfly stitches, bear witness 
As I hang with Jehovah's Witnesses

Yo, yo, this is manslaughter, so what you want to do 
Last year, you ran for the border with your crew 
I flip, stacks, all the, time when I rhyme 
Libra is my sign, and can't stand swine 
When I dine, the automatic weapon 
Got niggaz steppin', in the opposite direction 
My jurisdiction, is off grounds to you clowns 
My proposition, meaning you go round for round 
Straight up and down, I broke the sound barrier 
Scarier, than a tight skirt wrapped around a transvestite 
The grammar, hype, nigga check your stacks 
Or you'll be rhyming with a broke back 
Niggaz talk about they rollin deep up in here 
The only way you roll is if you in a wheelchair

Cause the real nigga gonna know what they gotta do 
Showin' and provin' youknowhatI'msayin? Shaolin forever 

Yo, may all the bullshit cease, increase the war fuck the peace 
Make shit hot like rockin' tube socks at Jones Beach 
N the summer, number one gunner run for cover 
Keep 'em steppin' with more Lethal Weapons than Danny Gloves 
I cock back, action packed raps and gats 
Niggaz trade mats for prats people react, to RZA sharp tracks 
Another day nother body dropped you better keep your shottie cocked 
For actin' snotty Hobbes catch karate chops 
Cause Wu-Tang live, forever and a day 
You better pray for better ways to get away when my Beretta spray 
We never play with commercialism 
The hardcore rhythm give em more hell than an exorcism 

My terrordome be a clever poem let it be known 
I'm packin' chrome and rollin phatter than eleven bones 
My crew's sicker than that AIDS shit 
While others get played quick, cause we be making hits through the grave sift 
My right hand man, myself and the Clan 
Gun and mic stands reverses help me see my first a hundred grand 
And to my Physical one love power crazy real 
For all them carbon copy niggaz lurkin' in the rap deal

Bring my x-ray visions
See trough you, lace for day
Every bullet counts
And we don't bush straight
I leave you in your ways
Leave your shit, spittin'
Hollow heads in your head
Hollow head collision
I'm bad news,
extra, extra, read about me
Blowin', stolen,
Cops glockin' 197 lobby
My philosophy making niggas think they rockin' me
They can't possible!
I'm not a suspect, i'm far from that
And that uncontrolled substance
Like crack, cocaine
And Inspectah Deck
I don't know how you see it
But it clean ya specks
I'm too complex, what you say complex?
I leaved you stressed with a complex
You better stop playin' games
That's the advice I suggest

Chorus 2X:
I walk like I'm at war
Talk like I'm at war
Don't sleep like it ain't war
You speek like it ain't war
Better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines
You better read the ""Art Of War""
Before crossing my lines

It ain't over till we even,
I even got the life support
Machines shook to keep you breavin
I'm beef increasing, bees season
You can peep my 8 by 10 photos
In the 1-20 prison
I'm runnin to your vision, squeezin
For no reason, make it so hot
Hot summer, Shyheim should be a season
Be the greatest like Ali Muhamed
We get a million youths to march
Trough New York like I live Muhamed
Predicted platinum, ya know should dimers
27 can glamerish, we communists
And ghetto richs to the extreme
Devine put the money behind the dreams
Of the microphone vein
Now rushin trough your screams...

[Shyheim]
Yo, for the one-nine-nine-nine shit's goin' change
Now it's us in the Range, God's giving us brains
Play the game, put my heart into it, you stupid?
I'm a gunner, whenever I got the rock I'll shoot it 
The undisputed champion on the M-I-see
Been Wu-Tang before it became a production company
Stay fresh like Doug, I run with the thugs
That'll cut your throat and sell your blood
Fifty/fifty love around the border
Should be bidding five to fifteen
On the Strength for the way I manslaughter
Rock your girl's boat like the Titanic
Man, I got more numbers than the Ninex, plus the Bell Atlantic
More hoes than forty-deuce
More clothes than twenty cleptos could boost
I'm not having it
I bring it to your label, producer and your management
Man, I'm like the Feds, I bring down your establishment
Under the Rico, I purchased my 3rd quarterly from Bob Cito
Got your block locked like the Dred, Mike Z and Chino
You know (What? What?)

[T.M.F.]
Look me eye-to-eye and see what you find
A crime nigga, nine spitter, mind digga, refined
Power impact, cracking your spine, mankind
Blow off the surface like landmines in my pastime
I saw it all, had plenty broads
Cut your wig short like Demi Moore
Ghost, vanished, most motherfuckers don't know I'm half spanish
Hazardous lyrical tactics, pinned to the mattress like canvas
Get your ass kicked for talking backwards
Puffin Backwoods, walking through the back of the hood
No protection, Stapleton section
Corrupt life, T.M.F. arch style, we rush mic's
Disarmed for that gold-piece charm
Red alert, we all alarmed, ready for combat
No contact, counting backwards ten-to-one
Now let me launch that, no way you can catch my format
I'm like the Gingerbread Man, moving on land
Catch me if you can, I move faster than the average man

[Dom PaChino a.k.a. P.R. Terrorist]
It's like gun play when my darts spray
Leave you scarred today, mental washed away
I shoot like Hardaway, your body parts decay
Slow-lay, too busy lusting the Rol-ay, platinum face
I snatch you over-arms, I take you out of space
Take you into my orbit, Terrorist gone corporate
Chopping tracks into sawdust, son, so you could snort it
In the conference room, Terrorist Hymn coming soon
Album cover pitch-black like the sky, without the moon
To illuminate, in my dome-piece there lies a metal plate
Titanium, harder than a lock in your gate
Burglarize your enterprise and have fun with your mate
Cause I'm not nasty, when doing my dirt, won't see ya masta me
Silent Weapons is a classic like Freddy Bassey
What a word pro, electro, grenade logo
Forever show how I firmly handle the phono
Bitches lust me, my plans of wetting the seeds in the mo-mo
Terrorist relating to Shy, mi vida loco (I feel the same way)

[T.M.F. #2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Eh yo, treasury, stacking this paper for Longevity
The money first, put it in work, that be my pedigree
Let's take it to higher degree
Sit back and visualize so our eyes could see
Black God, we living hard
Mugs get scarred, thugs get barred
Treated like slaves in the yard
Playing the field, most niggas tell and squeal
That's why I move for 'self, only me and my steel
Cause shit is real and leary niggas will rat you out
Get under pressure by the jakes when they smack 'em out
Gat in they mouth, for talking, you sleep-walking
Can't play the street often, become a victim for extortion
For your fortune, your bank rose
Stank hoes, you think I ain't cold?
Run up in your crib, take everything, even the sink goes
You sweat like a pink rose
Can you smell it, when you soft like velvet?
Catch one up in your helmet, get dealt wit
On the quick-fast, take you on a great adventure like Six Flags
Spent every day of my life just trying to get cash
So when my shit blasts
Duck behind buildings for shelter, or you'll get hit fast
Catch whiplash, fucking wit Trife, you must've skipped class

Bottom Up, Shyheim, The Greatest Story Never Told

[Shyheim]
I put a fifty in your mouth, out your ass for change
All you buckin' rap niggas, don't make me pull why'all strings
I write songs for gangstas, on the chain and can sing
A hundred rounds til the ding, I'ma die in the ring
Cause I'm a fighter, flick up your lighters
I got a bigger website than spiders, run with two five to lifers
That buck at biker's, get bucked on Riker's
I was shorty with the shitty diaper, sugar water made me hyper
Peter Piper picked peppers, but Shy fucked hoes
Put my gun in your face, like ""whoa""
Me and Black Rob, rob black, with the Tahoe
Cause he was gassed like Arco, beatin' him up PLO Style
I don't want to grow up, I'm a leaky leak kid
Got so many bags of dust, that I could play with
The Bobby, separate's my mind from my body
Stuck countin' my dirty money in project lobbies
Pockets full of drugs, tommy in my Tommy
Movin' like a zombie, off that bah bah bah shit
Welcome to Disney Land, I'm your host, Mickey
You down with PCP, you know me

[La the Darkman]
Yo, niggas call me a lot of shit, but they can't call me broke
I ain't pushin' trees, I'm pushin' E's of coke
With a cannon in my coat, hardly laugh, ain't a joke
Any foul confrontation, a nigga gon' get smoked
Might hit you with a gemstar razor, or a red dart laser
Take a piece of meat off you, when I blaze you
Like Albert Anastasia, I'm a mobster, I'm major
I'm loyal to my blood, not a fagot ass traitor
Big brother hustle great, I got to hustle greater
My operation's so smooth, they call me ice skater
With a mack ten, or eleven, cocked, the weather man
For super niggas, want to end up like Superman

[Shyheim]
I'm from the Island that's hotter than the Caribbean's
And that's how we Columbia necktie, law abiding citizens
Nine M&M's in the denim, is the minimum
Crack rocks bigger than M&M's, whiter than Eminem
Thousands, I quintuple them, like the Olympics signs
Red dot, yellow dot, green dot, all dimes
Black top, blue top, those go two for five
Get your money where you get it, don't scrutinize mines
Bitch, fuck you and them rhymes
I'm on the grind, to get rich or die trying
I done pushed enough time around niggas line
That get their bricks in New York, bad bitch in New York
Big chain, icy frost, roll some Porsche in New York

I get energized from the vocals, though
You feel what I though, Troop, you feel what I'm sayin'
Cause when it come in like that
I feel what you sayin', now feel what I'm sayin'

[La the Darkman]
Let's go, La the Darkman, play the wind
Recently, I shot a nigga, that I called a friend
He was foe, tried to steal some of my blow
Oh well, snakes in the grass, I chopped the head off they ass
Need an instant replay, I make it happen so fast
Til then, I'm gettin' all this money, fuckin' all these bunnies
Laugh a little bit, but ain't a damn thing funny
You dig? I got kids, and brothers to feed
Not to mention, my life, my bitches and what I need
Three story condo, car and truck combo
Bang hammers on niggaz, like Africans on Congo's
That's how my song goes, drugs, money and murder
Check to see if you can handle it, before you take it further, it's La

We be on easy street, ridin' through the red lights
You motherfuckin' alright, we down to kill to O.T

Shyne,"I done fucked the baddest bitches ask Trina
Give her coke to stuff between her, said she loved my demeanor
Felonies and misdemeanors, I'm vilified
I just, rap on the side, black mafia ties
Prolific words, I speak for the unheard
Niggas who love guns, money, girls, and furs
Sittin' up in the mans', runnin' shit
On the phone moving bricks, orderin' hits
Perfected the game, diamond infested the chain
Niggas think I change I just want to watch 'em change
Livin' the American dream
Drugs, violence, sex, and loaded magazines
That's all I could talk about in these sixteen
'Cause that's all I live, ask Tibs
It is what is, either graveyards or consecutive life bids, shit

[Chorus: x4]
Niggas want to bang, we could bang
Niggas want to slang, we could slang

Niggas want to bang we could bang out
Till the clip's done, or your vital arteries hang out
Ham a cot, Bad Boy, the black Camelot
Raise the price and connect the dots
Through life's journeys, all I need is a couple of mack mils
A couple of mils and good attorneys
Skatin' on big blades, goin' out in a blaze in my last days
I'll probably die with a bad drug trade or an overdose
Without tellin' my moms, sorry it was close
My wife and my bitch fightin' over my notes
All my niggas skied north makin' a toast
Till hell, just gimme bad bitches in Channel
Connects wit, Chinese cartels and that new S-L
And the judge that's gon' set my bail

[Chorus: x4]

I'm on top of this shit, look at the wrists
Too much rocks in this shit, ain't that a bitch
Make hits, til my last breath
With that nigga, the P you double F
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
I kill niggas on the spot like a cop
I did it all four seasons suites to a cot
Give bitches nothing but breath mints and this cock
Call me what, there's a way to eat
And all we got is sports, entertainment or the streets
I'm in deep, think of Citibank when I sleep
Ching, ching like I was from Shaolin
Brooklyn nigga what you say, keep stylin'
My air force ones you couldn't walk a mile in
I love politics, narcotics, and violins
Bad Boy forever, we move in silence

Uhh, uhh
In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girl
Just walkin uh, in your chinchilla fur
I was laid up in the Coupe, back shade up
Lookin at cha face just pure wit no makeup
A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the Coupe in hot pursuit
to stop and, introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you? You my destiny
And you're diamond cluster, too much just to touch ya
Perfume, down to ya structure
Think I'll wait, until the second night to fuck ya
I want to marry you, nah I'm just playin
But we can start wit a few nights, out in Malibu
Surfin, be layin up on Persians
Here's my number; put in ya purse and call me
[Chorus: Barrington Levy]
On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce, is not for ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus
[Shyne]
I'm gettin clo-ser, my player days is o-ver
Well maybe not completely
But still and all, come here, rest ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks 
Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh
[Chorus]
[Shyne] (Barrington Levy)
We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Child's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Sean don
Just a bottle of Evian; see'mon, uh
[Chorus]
[Barrington Levy]
So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa
Cause you I love, and not another
Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'ma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii
Always be there - for me
Always be there
Be there for me
Ohhhhhhhhh, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah

From cuttin' solid Purico to stack Fritos
went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and see-notes
game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
no tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""
what the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
grin and stand over your coffin like ""Hey you!""
tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
for now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
don't stop. 

[Chorus 2X]
Die for it
take the stand, lie for it
blow trial, get up in the chair and fry for it
never tellin' or snitchin'
rather swim with the fish'n

(First 4 lines with Jamaican accent)
I buy and sell bricks with my nigga P.D.
down with the team called B.B.E.
now if you want to join the team you know you must see me
buy ya can't talk to FEDS or dick R.I.D. 
It's a cold World baby boy, fuck it, I'm colder
Animals on my back keep my warm, my armor
Frank Lucas persona, warmin' coke up in the sauna
let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays 
nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflings
sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs.

POP POP POP! warning shot, who's to blame
Shyne mothafucka, don't forget the name
stretch the Caine, to cop the house and the plane
'till my Massacre, slain
brains hang from the window of my Range
fuck the FEDS, 2 green and one red
Firm tight, hold the dice in this game of life
Aces suffice
paper's a must
Fallen Angels and Angel dust
my team do dirt to avoid layin' in the dust
Million dollar portraits in my fortress
of course it's Po
bloodstainin', aeroplanin', Four-Hundred horses slow
Platinum cable, round table, so all the bosses know
I'm takin' over 
'cause they coke got too much bakin' soda
they say money ain't everything

I'm only what you made me

Can't you see it in my eyes?
I'm hopeless, fearless on the outside
Gun on my side

Shit, maybe if y'all niggas build schools instead of prison
I'll stop livin' the way I'm livin', probably not
I'm so used to servin' rocks and burnin' blocks
I ain't never gonna stop

Been doin' this shit all my life
I'm a lost cause
And what about the rest?
Don't them suckers deserve a chance?

Somethin' better than a shoot-outs, liquor stores and food stamps?
Maybe if y'all teach them niggas a craft an' a trade
They wouldn't have to play that corner
Why'know what I mean? Servin' that yay

America, you got a fuckin' problem
An' I ain't never goin' away
There's about 20 million other muthafuckers just like me

This ones for my Chi-town playboys

Come on, just play it with me

When it come to hoes, we don't love not one
Fucking a friend ain't no option, its a must
? stop cumming, fuck I gotta have two not one
She know a freaky nigga like me
Get her wet then I'm out like strike three
No doubt, make her girlfriend eat her out
After we fuck then the exit beat her out
Believe me, we don't love them hoes
Break out, after we dug them hoes
You want to stay bitch, what you talking 'bout?
Get your shoes on, and start walking on

Get out, I don't want to hug you
Get out, bitch I don't love you
Get out, what you talkin 'bout
Get your shoes on and start walking

Before I'm sticking the hole up in my face
In the place most niggas don't see love ? baby
I'm about to O.D. cocaine pussy
One stroke be a whole ki'
You're feminine, hood from heaven an'
I'll do anything, orals to S and M
Keep you satisfied, back certified
Come and take a ride, I'll be your great adventure
Tell ya friends I bent you, who sent you?
Must of been God, my bedroom angel taken
Loving the curves as you purr while I'm stroking
Grabbing ya hair, don't you dare shed a tear
You a good girl, don't cry
Shake that thing that I give
Throw ya back as I dig
Like a broke mattress you had me sprung out
But ain't nothing changed you got to get out

To all my niggas that know what I mean
When you fuck a bitch good she don't want to leave
I go through this all the time
Bitch act like she don't see the exit sign
Start crying, how much she love Shyne
That's the same thing she told my man Brian
What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my ? blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage
That I don't give a fuck about bitch fetishes
So when we fuck and its over
Throw ya pocketbook on ya shoulder
Put your shoes on and hit the road
I'll kick ya last name once, bitch and roll

If it wasn't cops all over, I'd smack him with this milli
You hoe niggaz move a brick and think they rich
Get a few guns and a click and want to take over shit
Ain't that the same kid that shot Reg in the head?
Turned him into a carrot, he might as well have been dead
Just came home from doin' ten up in the Feds
Be extortin' kingpins for they horse and they bread
Had the whole Brooklyn under pressure, I'm surprised he ain't test ya
Mad niggaz know better
I ain't comin' up offa, no cheddar, no bricks, no nothin'
I'll kick that motherfucker, fuck him, yeah I'll pay him somethin'
Pay his ass a visit, blow his brains on the sidewalk
Let him collect his thoughts..
I'm the strongest force in New York
Til I'm a corpse, and even then, I'll be buried with bricks
And money-filled vaults, seventeen shots and two weeks later
I'm in the spot, takin' it light
Watchin' the Tyson fight it's packed, uh with killers and rats
Dope dealers, money hungry bitches, malicious
Cars pilin' up the block for blocks nigga, Bentleys and 6's
This the place to be, where all the gangsters meet
As I pick up my drink, I see my man Fat Pete
But before I could walk over, two niggaz tapped him on the shoulder
And unloaded in his face, bullets flyin all over the place
Mirrors shatterin', people scatterin', his bodyguards shot back
Missed one but hit the other, in the abdomen, they both fled
But who the fuck would do somethin' so brazen and reckless?
Had to be some niggaz tryin' to send a message {*phone ringing*}
Next day I got a call from uptown to, 
Come have a meetin' with The Council
Bout the shit that's been goin down
Word is, same kid that killed Fat Pete shot Reg in the head
Bottom line he's out of control, he got to be dead
He's startin' to be a real problem
Extortin niggaz, Brooklyn through Harlem
But he fucked around and crossed the margin, touched one of ours
He got to go, he from your hood, handle it Poe
Say no mo', I'm out the do'
Went back to the spot to grab the guns
Semi-auto check, AK-40 check, shotgun check, revolver - that's perfect
Called Tiz and told him meet me in an hour
Bring the caravan, you know the plan
Ski-masks and stockings, seen him down the avenue boppin'
Him and a friend, just hopped in a Benz
Twenty inches on the rims, let's follow 'em slow, keep 'em in sight
Wait til he stop at a red light, then roll the window down
And kiss them bitches goodnight - they musta saw somethin'
Cause the Benz busted you and came at us firin' shots
I threw the revolver, grabbed the tec and left the driver's side wet
The Benz ran in a store window and got wrecked
I hopped out the van, ran up to the scene, still holdin' the tec
One nigga's body was split in half, the other nigga still movin'
Heard sirens comin' closer, as I'm bout to shoot him
But fuck it, I opened his mouth, and let the tec spray
And told him tell Satan I'm on my way die bitch",The Hit

I had the whole tri-state high, nigga I ain't frontin'
at Fifteen I sold my first bag of dope
used to stick Dominicans, burner under the coat
gettin' like 15 grams, a half a Ki
at Fifteen man, a nigga just glad to be
gettin' some shorts, me and my Man from a Hundred and Fifth
he knew some Dominican niggas that wanted a clique
to hold 'em down, shoot niggas in the head
throw 'em out windows if they were late with the bread
basically I'm enforcin'
around heavy coke, when nobody's lookin' I'd be dippin' in the portion
they wasn't missin' it
so I got my hustle on the side, flippin' it
sellin' like 500 bottles and Nicks, started minor
but I always knew I'd turn a big apple into cider.

Niggas...niggas just ain't built like me...
stand up niggas...since 15 
I been servin' fiends and loadin' magazines...
takin' shots..burnin' blocks..
this ain't no fuckin' rap.

[Verse 2]
Everything was everything 'till my Man got pinched
he had a shoot-out with the cops in front of the precinct
other than that, I went from enforcer to movin' product, straight white
powder now, gettin' it
the hardest nigga in the street
my first car was a 190 Benz with Louie Vaton seats
buyin' out the bar at the rooftop
I had a few spots
one called the jukebox
where I was gettin' like 50 a brick
2 or 3 bricks a day, makin' mothafuckas sick
my Cousin Ron a crook from the Brook was torchin'
any niggas whisperin' or talkin' 'bout extortion
shit was goin' right and only one better
when I got my Italian connect, hittin' me with pure Heroin
moved to 116th, started seein' real dinero then
empire buildin', the shit was takin' flight
had my bitches cuttin' up like 10 Ki's a night
mixin' lactose, Bonita, and Quenii
I was the first Black nigga with mafia ties
leased my soul to the Devil with the option to buy.

Yo..bangin' for real..
niggas is thinkin' rap, I'm thinkin' laundromat..
we washin' this money...
you think this shit is about rhymes...
you'll find yourself under the fuckin' ground...you know?..
we get low when the Feds is in town..
this is justice..
we playin' the pop charts and still lettin' them things pop off...

[Verse 3]
At 21 I was a legend, had the game transformed
controllin' manufacturin' and distribution of Heron
throughout the tri-state, high stakes
I spent Hundreds of Thou's out of paper bags
you couldn't name a car I ain't have
every minute new tags
Seven series to the Five-Sixty drop nigga
I was givin' away blocks nigga
fast cars, fast money, slow deaths
this things of ours 
had me doin' a hundred miles an hour 
through the City evadin' the Feds
started this shit called the counsel and we all made a pledge
not to fuck each others bitches
or touch each others riches
on top or broke 
never break this oath
every nigga in the counsel was a boss
we used to put coke on our dick and make bitches suck it off
it was alright 'till I got caught
charged with an Eight-Forty-Eight
behind Marion steel gates
niggas started shittin', actin' bizarre
drivin' my cars, fuckin' my broads, breakin' the laws
same niggas I took care of and got money wit' was on some funny shit
if I was different I'd snitch
what would you do if you got Millions with niggas and they had no love
for ya?
couldn't pay for ya lawyer
I figured shit, why sit in a cell to rot?
I'll be out in Ten, start over again
throw those boys in the pot, but I couldn't do it
you couldn't understand it of you ain't been through it
there's rules to this shit and I couldn't break 'em
death before dishonor 'till I meet Satan...I know he's waitin'. 

God forgive me...you've never seen a nigga like me in your life...
I'm what these lil' niggas rap about...
that's me they talkin' 'bout in they rhymes...
I did that time...I flipped that dime...
shoot-outs, jet planes, cocaine and automobiles...
The Life...love it.",The Life
Shyne,"[Shyne]
I just want to move mad bricks
for all the days I never had shit
Now I'm young heartless and rich
Pistols and pussy, straight from the door
Brown paper bags full of blood money, need more
Too much ain't enough
High off dust, greed never endin
Catchin bodies I want Gotti was supposed to be
It's overwhelmin
Face smothered in cocaine, against all odds
Life is what you make it, well I made it
Leavin motherfuckers naked
I get excited watchin niggaz bleed helplessly
Put 'em out they misery, selflessly
A coward dies a thousand deaths
I got a thousand tecs
Takin niggaz with me when I got, fo'rilla
I'll probably be all pissu when I blow, fo'rilla
Adrenaline rushin blood bushin
It's nothin long as I'm bustin
All gangstas is dead, or in jail
except for me I posted bail, all hail

[Chorus 2X: Shyne]
Money be the root of all evil, calico desert eagles
Bitch I'm comin to see you, all you niggas gon' die
Motherfucker die

[Shyne]
Fast cars and plea bargains, pictchin niggaz wigs
Have they families donatin they fuckin organs
What you like, stress you up, press your luck
Better hope you hit seven or find yourself in heaven
Lost my conscience somewhere in between
watchin niggaz die and leavin the murder scene
Hot gun in my waist, stockin over my face
and I tell you niggaz this, I never miss, check it
My point of view is me or you
And I'ma burn anyway, what the fuck?  Bust
seventeen shots up in your guts, truck blood drippin
Dead on arrival, leavin my rivals
lookin up at the clouds
The prodigal son, seein demons and devils
through the reflection, of my watch bezel
Embezzle, and racket, full metal, jackets
Poppin heat and, seekin, niggaz die internal bleedin
Hear mom screamin, bury Shyne
Cause when I come, motherfuckers all die

[Chorus] - 3X {*to fade*}",Niggas Gonna Die
Shyne,"[Shyne]
Geah.. new..
My niggaz frontin on pumpin and dumpin, leave 'em on the curb
Ridin on twinkies I'm (??) gun under my fur
Ma what you prefer?
His and hers (?) and villas, dope dealers and killers
who keep it real-a, chase paper fuck bitches they'll always be there
Burn blocks, bust your guns, rock your minks with flare
Live for the moment, fuck atonement
Explain to God when you see him
(?)lease a bigger day, til your paper reach the ceiling
Niggaz, we only live once
and I don't know about y'all, but shit I'm on mine
like Don Trump, Black Ted Turner, totin burners
Open dope spots on every block
Jumpin in and out of cherry drops
as the plot thickens, watch glistens
Feds trail us, surveil us, tell us
not enough evidence (?) us
Teflon, get knocked, put the bail up and get gone
In the name of Brooklyn Vietnam
And all you fuckin rappers, for the last time
The last name ain't Junior, my name is Shyne
Now take a paternity test, there's no relation
I'm the fuckin king, nobody stands adjacent

[Chorus]
All I want to do is get a brand new fifth
and a few ki's, spend some cheese
All I want to do is see my homies stay fly
until we all day, and spend some cheese
All I want to do is get this money washed
so I can lay back, and spend some cheese
Get right, live life, spend some cheese
G's ice, gun fights, spend some cheese

[Shyne]
Bandana wrap, under my fitted hat
I got mines stacked, nigga where yo' ticket at?
Floatin countin the two turbo's
Bitches I burned know Shyne Poe; Bad Boy - who's fuckin with that?
I done burnt down New York, ran through D.C.
And this rap shit here, ain't nothin to me
Got my murder game down for real
Gave lead showers to any coward who sold me flour
Poe's my power - these rappers frontin like they uncut raw
I'll be the first to tell ya, they talcum powder
Actin like I know them, I owe them
til I blow them, and leave they face in they fuckin scrotum
One change on the pike, under the moonlight
Headin nowhere fast, Desert in the airbags
Death's around the corner so I make detour slide to the Rucker
Firelli's burnin rubbers
Pull up in front, let my shit bump
Hop out, no respect for the cops
Got the glock out, lookin for a knockout
Somethin to put a seed in, nah nigga
Just somethin I can put some ki's in, come on

[Chorus]

[Shyne]
Nigga wait, push rhymes, push fives
push wigs back, push weight
Runnin narcotics in over twenty-one states
Thuggin and buggin I'll crack your fuckin chestplates
It's good old America the great, the land of the G
Home of the slave
Where corrupt politicans and black gangsters is made
Where you die at 25, shot up in your Merced's
Ridin on blades, livin for today
Fuck peace, bustin at the police
Young black and just don't give a fuck
You'd think it was the Olympics the way niggaz be sprintin
and jumpin when my (?) bust, pullin up in bigger trucks
like what?  Hand on my nuts
White gold smile, high profile
Bitches love the style
How the fur's fittin, gangster slur spittin
For my niggaz in Lewisburg sittin
I got to get it like Sisqo
It's the Don-da-Don-Don-Don
Switch flows faster than cops can shoot a black
as them bricks keep turnin and them blocks keep burnin, c'mon

Shyne,"Once upon a time, not long ago
When gangstas rocked waves sold dope and sniffed lo'
There was a young G by the name of Shyne Poe
Puttin' it down, cuttin' it up and cookin' it now

It's been a lotta dick ridin' for lack of a betta words
For lack of a betta words
Speculations on the guns, I hold underneath my furs
Similarities in my voice, nigga, check the words

I'm in for winter to doe's that pinch merds from the cur
Dodgin' and dippin' the narcs
It's the young Frank Matthews, the rap version
Touch my trap on my smack the gats burstin'
That's certain leave ya face and ya chest and ya back jerkin'

Y'all got me fucked up like
My desert eagle and my sick doom bust right
Like my guns is racin', muthafucka, don't you know I
Make ya heart stop and ya body start shakin'
Now you know the bottom line of this rhyme crime
Twenty-five to life plus nine

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Evil grin, dead eyes, walkin' wit a bock, monster
Best way to describe my posture
In this world of sin, I'm as wicked as they come
Moonlightin' as a rapper get this ticket and I'm done

Ain't enough money here, I ratha be in the tropics
Wit Corsicans where narcotics is the only topic
Persian rocks and things the man that made of snow
Tiger par and every other form of raw

Since a team been handlin', nigga been scramblin'
Bettin' on money in Vegas gamblin'
Desert in the abdomen, pissy drunk stylin', staggerin'
More than you can imaginin'

Thoughts randomin', runnin' through my mind
Like who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Shyne
Demented as a young'n, apple second comin'
Evil thoughts runnin' through my cerebellum

Shyne Poe, what the fuck you gon' tell 'em?
All you niggas that wanna be fly, my gun shots'll propel 'em
Leavin' somewhere smellin', repellin'
Closed caskets for you fuckin' bastards, c'mon

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Only the strong survive and weak niggas bleed
And get found, wit they fuckin' face down
Numb from the waist down
I done been to hell and back twice and still in crack

Stare death in the eyes and never blink
Headshots rip through my mink
Went to war wit the realist killas
Killed friends over jealousy and envy

My heart's empty behind the wheel of my Bentley
Coked up, feelin' invincible
'Bout to take over the world, I can't be stopped
Not the feds or the fuckin' cops, not even seventeen shots

Can put a end to this terror
I'ma live forever 'cause gangstas don't break
We just get plastic surgery and relocate to anotha state
Or island, smilin', money pilin', wildin'
Yo Puff, over done them fuckin' violins

This shit is bigger than me though ask Oliver North
Kill you then use your corpse to transport horse
Leave ya brains hangin' from ya fuckin' car window
Any nigga snitch and givin' info

Since my motha stomach coke and liquor
Was the mixture
Betta be prepared when we hit ya

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch
Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue

Whatcha gonna do when shit hit the fan?
Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch

In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girl
Just walkin uh, in your chinchilla fur
I was laid up in the Coupe, back shade up
Lookin at cha face just pure wit no makeup
A little bit of Mac lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the Coupe in hot pursuit
to stop and, introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you? You my destiny
And you're diamond cluster, too much just to touch ya
Perfume, down to ya structure
Think I'll wait, until the second night to fuck ya
I want to marry you, nah I'm just playin
But we can start wit a few nights, out in Malibu
Surfin, be layin up on Persians
Here's my number; put in ya purse and call me

On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce, is not for ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If my Firebird cannot take the curve
Girl put your ass in the damn Metro bus

I'm gettin clo-ser, my player days is o-ver
Well maybe not completely
But still and all, come here, rest ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks 
Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh

We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Child's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Sean don
Just a bottle of Evian; see'mon, uh

So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa

I'ma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii

Feed morphines to more fiends than you've ever seen
It's pain I deliver reflection
Every word like a mirror
Bigger picture I try to keep shit in perspective

Capitalistic driving force got no remorse

I was doomed
Repeatin' the lords prayers sittin' in this court room
I'm cursed

I wonder when I close my eyes will it hurt?
I'm suicidal
Can't take this pressure or this pain
Too much for these young eyes
Real G's don't die, that's a lie
'cause I'm dyin inside, cryin' inside
Look at me sweatin', palms shakin, hidin' inside
Drive bys and quarter ki's
This ain't what it oughta be
Almost caught a ki
they're tellin me that there's more to see
God listen, it was him or me
Sorry for the choices I chose
The bricks that I sold
The voices I rolled
The concrete roads
Accept me as I come into your presence

What's it all about?
Sittin in this jail house
Eleven counts, but only one count
that's the color of my skin
Black robes, white justice
Clarence Thomas is a motherfuckin puppet
Murder anyone over 21
Through my travels I've seen barrels and gavels
Diamonds and Castles
Caught up in this solution called life
When you bitch niggaz is shootin', aim right
Say goodnight to the bad guy
Last time you're gonna see a bad guy like me
I'm the last of the dying breed
Hope these words burn your brain
Find a place in your heart
Close my eyes and pray in the dark
Ask God what's the meaning?
Leavin niggaz screaming
Bullet holes bleeding, I see demons

Dried up, sittin' in a chair fried up

[Verse 2]
You know me; I don't need no introduction in this
Big gun, big dick, half of a meal on the wrist
Sittin in my continental thinkin' about potential connects
I live in all, just pencil the best
Parts of the live of a quintessential hustler
When I pull a slide back
Motherfuckers be hoppin' their faces don't get left open
You understand?
Shirt soaking, brain smoking left in the ocean floatin'
Shyne Po, dough, stack, y'all Rap niggaz is trash
I don't give a fuck how much records you sold
Tryin' to be me
Keep it real dog, you'll die to be me
You want to know how it feel, don't you?
To have a murder charge, took gun to the American Music Awards
And live life against stars
Doing 170 screaming ""FUCK THE WORLD"" (gangsta get outta the car)

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
Where the fuck them niggaz at? We gonna handle this beef
Turn your mic off bitch; see me in the street
Fuck peace 'til I'm rest in the dried up flesh is finish
I don't know how to tell until I'm in the morgue
Dysfunctional, highly uncomfortable paranoid
Without the extra clip (bitch), try me I'll puncture you
Had niggaz waking up with wings in their backs, halos in their head like
""Ayo I'm dead""
Can a knight fucking princess Diana type
Vane wives, vane light, pen I write cold, hand of ice
They said too much for the motor mind to comprehend
Walk wit me, pause take a breath
Things ain't just the same for gangstas
Sleeping in diamond, it's fucking up the game for gangstas
While charges tryin to ring a gangsta
Through it all I maintain my gangsta

[Verse 1]
Ohh you rhyme witta slug and sum shots in his face
He rhyme witta slug tryna sound like ma$e
Listened to his tape, this lil' nigga used to sound like cake
Maybe I'm juss killin, maybe he juss snitchin
See a whole lot different when my sales ecliped
What I see is straight bug, straight thoro
Yea he be a killa, you kill wit bugs
Rather look at the facts not the hype
Like who got shot and who got knifed
Who keep gettin struck, but don't neva strike
Hope the beef go away but the feds indict
I know yo card nigga, it's so clear
You juss want to sell record you don't want warfare
You don't want to ride you want to get rich and hide
These niggaz would've died if they shot me nine times
Heyy it's juss for the best
Take this mob shit seriouse, please respect it

[Hook]
And there go the shots stay rippin 'em apart
'cause it's a blood comin outta his slum
It's murdah bloody homicide is what they cry
When they losin' their life
When muhfuckaz ax me how I sleep at night
Pretty cold witta slug might heat me tight
Pray to god while I'm gone, is what underneath feels like
It's my work by the surf when they turn off the lights

[Verse 2]
You ain't kill humma 'cause if you did
Why you ain't get the pen after all of that hit
You know I know, that if you live
That shit that you spit, somebody got somebody
Somebody got jumped, somebody got cut
Yoo pac's a nigga, nobody got shot
Nobody got flushed, you screamin what what
Okay okay killa you'sa slut
Think about it, enoughs enoughs
I'm tryna show 'em whoes who
And what is what
I mean how can I respect you
When them niggaz that left you ain't none of 'em blessed you

You know where they are, where they perform
Bust yo gun, stop makin songs

Death of perfection as I move witout motion
Ain't no nigga in his game doin the shit that I'm quotin'
Take a good look 'cause you'll neva a see enought of me
Might be sum otha g's tryna trace n color me
But I believe in the ways of old
Slice these niggaz throat tryna tell on po
That shouldn't excist, fuckin snitch
Cut of his dick, put it on his lips
You really think I was gon' let you slide
Fuckin wit me you must be outcho mind
You really think jail was gon' make thinks right

Bleed for the streets love the war

And fucking with Goodfellas? Uncle Paul got me dying to ball
Every thing I talk about I live it

I was designed to hold nines, and grind
Step out of line put you in that white line

Gimme a tech that don't jam (bang bang)
I'm tryin to jucks some more grams and work this whole thing
My minds poisoned, corrupted and diseased
360 ki's
Money make the world spin
I make your chest smoke
Have your mother singing hymms
Particles of your brains up on your tims
Kiss you before I twist you
170 miles
Headed for disaster faster
I put it down right
Bustin off these rounds like
Real niggaz is kings
You ain't rockin' that crown right
Harder more PK watches
Topless, bitches in cars
Only meals could heal my scars

Niggaz want to rhyme like shine like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to bust their guns like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to grind like crime like me
They supposed to
Niggaz want to mash like me, dash like me

Allegations got me pacin'
Grand jury wouldn't understand my fury
For fast cars and jewelry
I could give a fuck if there's a heaven for a G
This is heaven for me
Go to trial never plea
Do a bullet and come home to the throne
I don't rhyme, I just talk about this life that's mine
I've seen niggaz die, in front of my eyes
Doin' my filth
Niggaz is expiring like milk
Different strokes for different folks
Just give me, different coke in different boats
Black Aristotle Onassis
All I see is crack addicts and automatics
You rap niggaz is faggots
y'all cannot be serious
I'm in coupes with gucci interiors
Airin' out your areas
Tech nines, two in the flex and shit
Lookin' at myself like
Yo, I'm the best in this

[Chorus x2]

Sometimes I really wonder
What's it all about?
How many bitches can I fuck until I get out
How many ki's can I cut, guns can I bust
Wigs can I push, spots can I juck
Every single one, 'cause I'm a fuckin' savage
Til I'm cremated, most hated, self made
Blood type G
All these young hustlers want to bubble like me
They supposed to
Sippin on syrup, until I perish
Pickin' bitches off the run-way
Look forward to, gun-play
Go to sleep with one eye shut
Wake up and do the same shit
I ain't never gonna change bitch

Yeah, it's a wrappity wrap

P-O, nothing more to it
I'm gully, what, I've really been through it
From the stoupe to the coup and anything in between
I carry a sleet through me, niggaz live out they dreams
Throw the ones in the sky or up in the bing
I do it for them, when I'm crackin' them rims
See me doing solo, silver pot holes
Bustin' off Roscoe's, like fuck it, I'll buy a new set tomorrow
I'm the horror, the system belt
Suck liquor, out my mom's tits, instead of milk
I'm society's filth, shit, I feel no guilt
Well fear couldn't feed Po, what the fuck, I need mo'
Mo', mo', catch me posted up on one Pivot
By the looks of my arm and palm, it's been a blizzard
Bitches want to know, who that nigga Po
When you think of me, just think of snow
Call white, hard white, masterpiece, all white
It's alright, I could take you out tonight
And put you in some things
Have you lookin' like something, diamonds, buttons
It's the predicate felon, millionaire dollar rederick
Tellin', spittin' thesis, for my connections
Leave a nigga speechless, can't talk with a gun in your throat
Yeah, I'm loc'd, been around too much dope
All my life, brain ain't never been right
Don't hear shit, I air shit, niggaz lose sight
It's bigger than mics, come fuck with the kid
O.G.'s look at me, like that's how I live
Niggaz look from the sky, like, yeah I stay live
Resurrected through the necklace or the gold coated six
Gangsta never die, as long as I'm alive
And when I go, it's gon' be another Po

[Chorus: Shyne]
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do
When you see that watch blue, it's for you
When you see that coupe with no roof, it's for you
For all my niggaz who ain't here with me
You still here with me, everything that I do
Kid that I fried around the way, was for for you
Connect that I tied the other day, was for you

Yellow tapes, yellow bottles and, yellow rocks
It's the number one gunner, pop pa-pop pop
Hard top, windows black, that's the way, how gangsta mack
Comin' through bumpin' Thriller, like I'm really a killa

No, I hit you when it's burnin' or numb
Who you, screw you, just for burnin' ya gums, get it right

Noise over beats, ya'll niggaz hymen
My other shit is real, I'm buyin' jet fuel

shit, sometimes man, a nigga be contemplating,
yo, living in fuckin' hell, nigga die, might be better.

[Verse 1]
walk through the shadow of death, my dick out pissing
rebel, laughing at the devil, homicidal threats
only if he knew, I want to lie a coal, who the fuck want to die old
on this miserable earth, forever, put me in dirt
it's better then living searchin treasure
that only brings atrocity, and treachery, baby mothers stressing me
ain't no hope left in me
live everyday like it's my last
waitin' to meet my niggaz that passed
at last I could meet Christ, ask him why the fuck you died on the cross
here these stupid motherfuckers, they still lost
I'll ask Malcolm, see what it was like to fight for civil rights
and nights he thought he would die, what did he do
did he grab his gun and a bust shot?
get on my knees praise Big and go fuck with Pac
find out did he really take 5 shots
ask him, who shot ya, was it the Feds?
couldn't of been Big Poppa, Brooklyn niggaz ain't braille
like that, ask Martin, why the fuck you ain't fight back

life ain't real its a dream we see tomorrow
reality, shit that's pain and sorrow
reality, disaster beat breaks,
a little girl up in the projects gettin raped
reality's a nigga gettin rock shot 41 times
and you askin why I run from one time
I don't even get justice,
nigga sometimes, no times, oh I'm bout to lose my mind
reality's fucked up, like a hard workin mother, losing her job
the battle of good and evil
like the devil, ain't losing for god, we on lucifer's squad
not knowing what the fuck it all mean
I can't even, get a can of sardines
niggaz driving bentley's, burning money, I'm yearnin money
taking your shit, I'm earning money
yet you call me a thief I call me a broke nigga trying to eat
on this earth suffering, why its like that
guess we the punished, blame Adam and Eve

CHORUS (3X)
if you had a choice

[Verse 3]
hold your latex, from nuns I take sex,
play chess, with the devil from the sky
like rain shells drop immune to this cold world's sorrow
beyond shell shock, can't you tell pop, I need some help ox
see them meadow officers watchin' myself rot
ice pick and cell blocks
hope the 12 stop on the highway to hell, switchin lanes
niggaz that know, what I mean to suffer and struggle in the gutter
slice birthday cakes with box cutters
I did not stutter, you heard me this is utter, reality

Where you be?
Come on, just play it with me

[Shyne]
When it come to hoes, we don't love not one
Fuckin a friend ain't no option
It's a must, her friend assists like Stockton
When we fuck, I gotta have two not one
She know a freaky nigga like me
Get her wet then I'm out like strike three
No doubt, make her girlfriend eat her out
After we fuck then the exit beat her out
Believe me, we don't love them hoes
Break out, after we dug them hoes
You wanna stay bitch, what'cha talkin 'bout?
Get your shoes on, and start walkin on

Hook: Slimm + Shyne

Get out, I don't wanna hug you
Get out, bitch I don't love you
Get out, what'cha talkin 'bout
Get your shoes on and start walkin

You know you hittin, you got me lickin the hole
Before I'm stickin the hole up in my face
In the place most niggas don't see love drug baby
I'm about to O.D. cocaine pussy
One stroke be a whole ki
You're feminine, hood from heaven an'
I'll do anything, orals to S and M
Keep you satisfied, back ?certified?
Come and take a ride, I'll be your great adventure
Tell ya friends I bent'cha, who sent'cha?
Must'a been God, my bedroom angel taken
Lovin the curves as you purr while I'm stroking
Grabbin ya hair, don't'cha dare shed a tear
You a good girl, don't cry
Shake that thang that I give
Throw ya back as I dig
Like a broke matress you had me sprung out
But ain't nothin changed you got to get out

Hook

To all my niggas that know what I mean
When you fuck a bitch good she don't wanna leave
I go through this all the time
Bitch act like she don't see the exit sign
Start cryin, how much she love Shyne
That's the same thing she told my man Brian
What the fuck, she think I'm stupid?
Don't know my pimp blood is deeply rooted
Inherited, that be my heritage
That I don't give a fuck about bitch fetishes
So when we fuck and its over
Throw ya pocketbook on ya shoulder
Put your shoes on and hit the road
I'll kick ya last name once, bitch and roll

Hook x2



",Buried Alive Intro
Shystie,"Why didn't you say this before, them times when I wanted more
Remember I moved too you but then you said you weren't sure
So we sat and spoke about this and agreed to stay friends
And now your saying that you want me when I'm moving out the ends

Look at my friends that you've been through
I've seen what you put them through
Your wrong, its kind of long,
I've now moved on, I can't get with you

Sorry to tarnish your plans
But you need to understand
That you had that chance to be my man
But didn't feel to take the stand

And now your telling me today
When tomorrow I'm moving away na, that's deep I can't stay
You need to know this, I ain't taking no notice
'cause I was raised not too let no man distort my focus

Thou my heart is sugar coated
Its sealed and still bolted
Hun I notice, how you move
So I could never be devoted
Don't risk what you got, 'cause you got too much to loose
'But I love you' na you just dazed and confused

[CHORUS]
Make it easy on yourself [x4]

[VERSE TWO]

This whole scenario, just shows we weren't meant to be
'cause I love as my friend now, so it's best I leave
Look.. your out there studying your masters degree
While I like a thug that devises bank robberies

Ya see, Shystie's all about living life fast
Hopping in and out of cars, thugs repping it large
You can't change your ways, so just keep to your books
Because there's no such things as 'No half way crooks'

This is what I'm on, who I am, I ain't gona change
I'm about the street fame living in the fast lane
Let me make this brief, my ways get me into beef
So I need a man, that's on guard ready to roll deep

Use your logic don't go with your heart, I'm rough round the edges and dark
Yeah we got a deep past but it will never last
I'd rather past, you were right from the start,
Friends until the day we die, friends until we past

[CHORUS]
[Repeat]

[VERSE THREE]

Look, you need a relationship that's stable, I ain't really able
I know you got faith boo, but I'm far from a angel,
In my ends I'm labelled, my tag name will say it all
So I couldn't guarantee to you that I'd stay faithful

You need a girl that moves with a slow tempo
Appreciates the things you do and gets sentimental
I ain't the one to like, your not my hubby type
Don't throw away your life your playing with a game of dice

'I don't care what you say I wana be with you
I wana hold you down I've opened up my heart to you'
Right now I really don't care this situations not fair
In months to come I bet that you'll forget I even lived here

I'll be your blurred memory,
I bet you won't even remember me
You'll be like what's that chicks name again
Like you ain't heard of me

So just keep your head and just hold it firm
And we can both take this as a lesson that we've learnt

[CHORUS]
[Repeat]



",Make It Easy
Shystie,"Ohhh..
uh ha.....

[Verse One]
I grew up in H-town living life on the blocks
From then that's when I became unorthodox
I use to tie knots in ma socks
filled them with rocks And I'd swing your jaw if you gave bad looks

Now I, haven't changed still slightly deranged
Still slightly outraged and I feel insane
At way I contain so much pain
like a feen Life is real do you know what I mean?

Its like, ever since the days I was young
man was bussing full clips and the run of your tongue And
in my hood I see mans get worked
Then ah man would come back n say that man got murked

Yea, I can say that my live's been hard
Six of us lived in ah two bedroom yard
So I keep this in mind full well knowing I know where I've been
so I know where I'm going

[Chorus]
You don't know where I've been
You don know what I've been through
So how can you judge me?
You don't know about the life that I got
You don't know what its like to live in my slot.
this worlds gone mad and it don't seem right
every night I pray to god please turn out the light
that would be my one wish!
(that would be my one wish)
(that would be my one wish)
that would be my one wish

[Verse 2]
I got that H-A-see blood in me
I rep my east side I'm that ghetto gully mind chick
born in E5 And I've always moved
with mans ever since I was young
'cause these girls are too bitchy and their mind set is long

Yea I learnt how to move and stay wise on the street
'cause my older boy's showed me how a girl should roll deep
I saw moves get moved, watch man move what they move
To survive out here you got to do what you do

Hustling on the corner shotting work
'cause when your grinding you gota make shit work
'cause life is hard and life is real
And mans now ah days don't care when they kill

Boys young as sixteen
life's taken and gone and I sit back and sigh
what the fuck is going on This is wrong
to the families of lost ones I'm sorry R.I.P to babys Jessica and Holly

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse three]
The hood holds loyalty
the hood holds faith The hood holds struggle
and the hood holds rage
The hood holds haters that wana grudge me
But I don't watch you only god here can judge

So I don't care if you like me or hate
'cause lately a lot of heads wana vibe crazy
But I ain't here to make new friends
Shystie is jus here to make ah means to ah end

So, ima be the reason why you step up your pace in this race
Ima take every chicks fan base
And ima be the realist girl in the game
Ima be the reason people forget your name

'cause I'm big inner dis
big bad inner dis
And I don't care who likes me and whose pissed
'cause Shystie's here and I'm repping it for London
I'm never gona be ah pop Emcee, you must be dumb man

[HOST]
Hello welcome to the Nathan never show
Tonight we got many guess and exclusive videos
But first, we'd loved to get this woman between my sheets
Yeah you guessed it we got shystie in a hot seat

To be quiet honest I'm like sick to death with you
All these kids running around idolising you
From graffiti on trains too kids tattooing your name
What's next for heavens sake a shystie video game

Just kidding you're on the path to ultimate fame
Now can you explain how you got in involved this game?

[SHYSTIE]
First of all you need to watch your mouth and mind how you chat
Cause you're getting excited and best you relaxed
Bro, you got me confused like some closet Homo
But further more well discuss that shit after the show

Any way I made my name on this scene as a teen
And these broad page, pages that you seen that's just me
Because my PR you no ruth down there and sainted
She's blown me up now I ain't nothing to play with

[HOST]
Shy as you said this scene like male dominated
I mean you no some women get frustrated
It's hard to keep focus and self motivated
Results to women doing tings x rated
I'm mean you just got to keep control
I no a few stars that sold their soul
Even servicing there services on road
I mean shy I no you ain't no hoe

[SHYSTIE]
Listen yeah those question I ignore em 'cause I've got decorum
So I leave it to the girls who like whoring while I'm touring
Further more that question rude do you perceive me as some sket
Do I look like a girl that's who sleeps around to build a rep?

[CHORUS]

Question after question being asked
I don't know how long my patience's gona last
I am who I am so let me be who I be
I just want to spit man I don't need this grief

Question after question being asked
I don't know how long my patient going last
I am who I am so let me be who I be
I just want to spit man I don't need this grief

[VERSE TWO]

[HOST]
I mean you got Will smith and jada Beck's and posh,
J-low and Ben aflet, 50 and vivica fox
Lauren and her Rasta king eminem and Kim
It's a endless celebrity lists, I don't know were to begin

ooh year not to for get jay z and beyonce
And there's rumours going round that you have a fiance

[SHYSTIE]
Listen yeah your talking like you no me you don't know me
Me and you ain't no friend's blood you're to nosey
All your question after question man its all bullshit
And I ain't going to fuel your fire towards it cha

Who I sleep with in between my sheets I keep discreet
I don't need my business talk about on the street

[HOST]
Look, I'm a strapping lad a masculine chap
I mean I play croquet but I can learn how to rap
Only last two minutes but believe I'm good in the sack
Sometimes I last a little longer but my woody clasped

I'm begging you please my marriage is like turned in to rubbles
Baby me and you could be the next celebrity couples

[SHYSTIE]
I can't stand when these interviewers don't pay attention
And not to mention you look like you're on a pension
You look like that ronald MC Donald and MC hammer
And by your heavy breathing I can tell you got no Stamina

You came on stage with your bow legged walk
Grey hairs on your head and that slur in your talk
From the start of your show I didn't take you serious
I don't even like you point blank and period

[CHORUS]
[REPEATED]

[HOST]
Its time for the audience to participate in the fun
Throwing question at you like a cricket ball that's been swung
It could be negative criticism that slips off the tongue
If I were you I would not be bother by none of these bums

Ok you first 'me ' no the guy with the thong in his head
You air head chop, chop time is ticking ahead

[AUDIENCE MEMBER 1]
Ok hi em hello my name is Bernard yeah

No hi good bye ergh..

[AUDIENCE MEMBER 2]
Yeah I love your stuff; yeah it's rugged and ruff
I'm in to hip hop me, I'm in to will smith and puff
It must have been tuff, brought up in the ghetto and that
You must have had to sell crack to put clothes your back

Look don't stereo type me because I'm from the ghetto
I ain't buss no guns or drive by's so just settle
Shit what the fuck, what do you wana hear me say
Ok I'm armoured with live grenades and ak's

[AUDIENCE MEMBER 3]
I thing your so articulate
Your lyrical content is magnificent
Such emotion such conviction
Such intimacy, such addiction

[SHYSTIE]
Thanks to everybody that supporting me out here
Listen yea My album is dropping out of the end of the year
So, when it comes out go down to the stores and cop it
'cause you play a part of putting figures in Shy's pocket

[HOST]
That's enough of this fraf forgive me shy for all of this crap
It a commercial break soon, but I got one thing to add
I mean hmm, what's your actual chances of making it
This could be tumbling career that lasts one minute

Can you progress through this race to the very finish?
I mean all your competition can you handle it?

[SHYSTIE]
Competition you're joking mate that means I feel threaten
And there not no artist in this game that's got shy sweating
Na, I take the piss I tell it how it is right now
And 'cause I'm real, you see your fans, I'm here to take them right now

Ha Ha simple you feel me doe
From head to toe, my whole style and flows original
And I don't like them fizzy pop emcees yeah I said it
You're all shit I'll waste you like a ten-pound credit.. What!

[AUDIENCE]
Go shystie Go shystie Go shystie Go shystie

[SHYSTIE]
Other than that, I'm down too earth a star from the birth
More than worth you to spending your album money to hear my verses
I say what people think but are to scared to say
I'm that wild renegade and I been let out to play

Now imagine if this whole globe was run by jus women
Jeeze cor blimme what a world we would live in
Getting men all hung upon our love until they be sprung
Imagine men on page three posing nude in the sun

AND--- Imagine ladies pimping these guys
Getting them to sell there bodies on the streets at night
Think, we can choose a man then we treat them bad
Get what we want and need then we ditch them Lads---

Call them to attend to our needs
Get a web cam set up so my friends can see
Then make him pole dance on my bed post then expose him
And put his pictures on the net so everybody knows him

Imagine them with stush attitudes
Or the had a shy mood so we make the first move
But we use them for ah one night flex
Sayin don't get attached baby boy its just sex

[CHORUS]

Imagine the first prints on the moon was ah five
And all the world leaders had a trimmed bikini lines

And the red light district was only full of man
Posing nude looking rude in the shop windows
This world feels like heaven Amen the lord know

Jesus come on guys please us
You're the birds and were the geezers
Imagine if guys took pride all the time

So ladies stand up firm, (Firm)

To flip reverse this universe
Together woman we can run this earth

Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Right out of space your haunting face appears

Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Si Zentner,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

But I'll keep on waitin' 'til you return.
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam.
You can't be happy until you bring it home,
Home to the greenfields and me once again.",Green Fields

Momentarily she brings peace to me 
Momentarily she brings peace to me

Someone who's listening 
And still she stays 
Her time is precious 
Until I am safe 
She gives her presence

He knows she likes fresh breath
He rushes to the station
He waits atop the steps
He's brought with him a mars bar

A love-lorn serenade, a trade

How can he become the psychic that he longs to be to understand you

Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in

I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed

And I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator

I will time you as you run up to down
And you will measure my footsteps as I pleasure this town
The mean of our heights is divided by the
Nights
Which is timed by the daggers in the root of all our fights

The pass of your poem is to sway me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

I am a dash and you are a dot, when will you see that I am all that you've got?

I'm a binary code that you cracked long ago, but to you I'm just a novel that you wish you never wrote

I'm greater than x, and lesser than y


So why is it that I still can't catch your eye?

You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I'm sitting here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurt

Oh Academia, you can pick me up, soothe me with your words when I need your love.

You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is over analyzed again

And if I am a number I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words you are afraid to be the one
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one
And if I'm four words then I am needing of your love.

Wanna throw you from the roof

Wanna put my hands through you

Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us

You give me a taste of you and no one
But you always leave, and again I'm alone
This secret burns but I'm imprisoned

I put a little make-up on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette
But I'm strapped to my chair
And it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill
Your chance to make history

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why
I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry

Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word

You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die

Looked me straight in the eye

Siân Phillips,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,

Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory

Not bound in any way by selfishness or greed

Suddenly so flimsy and weak
So did they ever exist?

So I could judge who had my happiness in mind

Count me out if I'm to serve you further
My best interest isn't your best interest
Let me out if it's that one-sided

Count me out if I'm to serve you further

Screaming and crying, we'll have none of that
You had you're chance, now just sit and relax
Don't you wanna sink to the bottom with me?

We're all rotten, buried and forgotten, living it up underground
So take a ride, hey, hey, hey, hey
You really can't be looking so surprised
If you can't beat 'em, might as well eat them
No one's getting out alive, give it a try, hey, hey, hey, hey
It really is a wicked way to die

And you'll get used to it in a while
Look at the way each of us smile
You were living a fantasy
This is exactly what you need

If you wanna sink to the bottom with me
[Incomprehensible], reeling and rotten beneath
One, two, three and down you go
Feel that smile just start to grow

Is he ready for the big surprise
He'll be playin' Lego in a dream
When the shadows come to life

Age nine then he should've been fine with a secret he's sure to keep
Two times and they tell a little lie
For the sake of him and me
Now it's over

While you were ticking me off
Gotta be stoned leave me alone

Now he's three years to the day
Confused, but unlike you
This feeling wont go away

Sixteen and the woman down the street
Has invited him to come inside
First time and it didn't feel right
It'll be the last time he tries

While you were ticking me off

I wont say nothing's wrong.

Seventeen and all he's ever seen is
A limit in between the lies
It's kind of funny how a mind
Can keep living in denial

Eighteen is a very strange scene,
And hes still playin with the past
Expelled, maybe someone could've helped
If someone had known to ask

Are larger than they used to be

Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand
In this age of unreason
There's a time and a season for love, stand

Like a pilgrim traveling in disguise
I searched for God, I found it in your eyes
Now, I know there is a place
Where sweet compassion never dies

It's between the darkness and the light
In the deepest stillness of the night
There's a fire that burns
Where hearts will find their wings and take to flight

Come on and stand, plant your sword in the sand

I gas it up then it's a go
Until the wheels fall off engine explodes

To the damn Matrix got a few new foes
Every second I got, I try to live me up
The harder the work the better the odds
I intend to rock the truth and sell
And not go prostitute myself
Fuck if that's stressin' me
Clock tic tocs and it's too late to bring back yesterday
So I invade your playlist
Make kids turn it up and wake the neighbors
And take the numbers that create the matrix
And get them placed on my paychecks
What!? let's go.

And the pressure of the game

And lightness has a call that's hard to hear.

With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee.
He never did marry  or see a B-Grade movie.
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me.

Got my paper and I was free.

Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before.

Along came a spider, sat down beside her
And whispered in her ear

From the momentary lack of stable ground
Looked for you and the room was spinning

Looks like I won again
I can't believe what you just said
I'll let you do the math
If you can do it in your head
Darlin' you can't add
And your subtraction skills are sad
So let's call it even and start over instead

Why do we bother with it escalater
Waiting around for the crowd to disperse
The longer it drags just gets worse and worse

Shaking like an oscillator
So many battles lost and won
That we need a calculator
Nobody won the war
Now what were we fighting for
Got lost in all the convoluted roar

Evaporation cools you down
Some day you're gonna blow you've been smoldering for years
No one ever comes around anymore

and I remember a long lost summer
when you and I were a whole lot better friends 

In sky clad fields we came together
hard to hold in moonlit heather
get off me boy, you're breaking my back again 

And a mouth full of broken words
was all I had and all she heard
as the sun set down to disappear
into the haziest sunset of the year 

So we drove for days and talked about nothing
as the fields rolled by an American discussion

Do you recall the place that you're from
who do you like and who do you love
who do you hate and who's your favorite band

Stranded on the other side of town?
The sun came up, we pushed the Dart to the station by the park
They start selling again at six
Mechanic got an early start, while we waited for the part
We sat and drank ourselves sick

Clouded up and the snow came down all day
Tonight the show's at least an hour's drive away
I propose this time we take my car
Can't miss it, it will be the best by far
The party came and went, the carpet's soaked, the keg is spent
And there's a ringing in my ears
Everyone said it was the best, you and I cannot attest
I guess we had more fun last year

The sun came up and it's shining in my eyes
Managed to miss the best night of our lives
Walk through the snow until you feel the sting

You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

I have no will, you've made your kill

So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Sid Phillips,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

I found a heart just a little bit truer

How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey

And I'm still awake,
So I picked up a pen and a page,
And I started writing,
Just what I'd say,
If we were face to face,
I'd tell you just what you mean to me,
I'd tell you these simple truths,

Be strong in the Lord and,
Never give up hope,
You're going to do great things,
I already know,
God's got His hand on you so,
Don't live life in fear,
Forgive and forget,
But don't forget why you're here,
Take your time and pray,
These are the words I would say,

Last time we spoke,
You said you were hurting,
And I felt your pain in my heart,
I want to tell you,
That I keep on praying,
Love will find you where you are,
I know cause I've already been there,
So please hear these simple truths,

Be strong in the LORD and,
Never give up hope,
You're going to do great things,
I already know,
God's got His hand on you so,
Don't live life in fear,
Forgive and forget,
But don't forget why you're here,
Take your time and pray,
These are the words I would say,

From one simple life to another,
I will say,
Come find peace in the Father,

Be strong in the LORD and,
Never give up hope,
You're going to do great things,
I already know,
God's got His hand on you so,
Don't live life in fear,

And You said come and follow me
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams
Would I love You enough to let go

Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me

You can have me
If You're all You claim to be
Then I'm not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering
I will love You enough to let go

As my conscience fell
A silly little lie

It didn't mean much
But it lingers still
In the corners of my mind

Still you call me to walk
On the edge of this world
To spread my dreams and fly

But the future's so far
My heart is so frail
I think I'd rather stay inside

But You love me anyway
It's like nothing in life
That I've ever known
Yes You love me anyway
Oh Lord, how You love me
How you love me

It took more than my strength
To simply be still
To seek but never find

The reasons we change
The reasons I doubt
And Why do loved ones have to die?

But You love me anyway
It's like nothing in life
That I've ever known
Yes You love me anyway
Oh Lord, how You love me

I am the thorn in your crown
But You love me anyway
I am the sweat from Your brow
But You love me anyway
I am the nail in Your wrist
But You love me anyway
I am Judas' kiss
But You love me anyway
See now I am the man who yelled out from the crowd
For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking ground
Yes then I turned away with a smile on my face
With this sin in my heart, tried to bury Your grace
And then alone in the night I still call out for You
So ashamed of my life, my life, my life

But You love me anyway
Oh God, how You love me
Yes You love me anyway
It's like nothing in life

Died on a cross between two thieves
And on the third day the stone rolled away
He beat back death so we could say

Sidewalk Prophets,"Christmas is the time of year
For being with the one's we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feelin'
Watching the one's we love
Having so much fun

I was sittin' by the fire side
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that he came to us
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Hey yeah, that's what I wanna hear
Heh heh

And the love that we're living

Sidewalk Prophets,"What child is this
Who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant king to own him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet

The virgin sings her lullaby

Sidewalk Prophets,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten,
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten,
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

And I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

And I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white",White Christmas
