Juanes,"Es más fácil dar la espalda a los problemas y decir, 
""Esto no me importa ya"" 
Es más fácil ser cobarde que valiente 
Si ver que las cosas salen mal 

Los problemas, nuestra casa 
El día siguiente la soledad no nos deja respirar 
Es como estar librando una batalla a muerte 
Oh 

Es duro aceptar lo que no puedes cambiar 
A quien no le importa la felicidad? 
Yo solo no quiero abrir la puerta 
Matar las penas 
Sanar la herida 

El amor lo cura todo 
Nada es más fuerte que el amor 
Si lo intentas es posible 
De lo contrario imposible 
No lo sabrás 

Verte así me parte el alma 
Inevitable tu soledad 

Tu soledad 
Es como estar librando una batalla a muerte 
Oh

Es duro aceptar lo que no puedes cambiar 
A quien no le importa la felicidad? 
Yo solo no quiero abrir la puerta 
Matar las penas 
Sanar la herida 

El amor lo cura todo 
Nada es más fuerte que el amor 
Si lo intentas es posible 
De lo contrario imposible 

El amor lo cura todo 
Nada es más fuerte que el amor 
Si lo intentas es posible 
De lo contrario imposible 
No lo sabrás.",El Amor lo Cura Todo
Juanes,"Mi corazon te besa 
Ya que mi alma no lo se 
Tanta belleza 
Tanta belleza 
No puede ser 

Son demasiadas cosas 
Es mejor ir una a la vez 
Armémonos esta noche 
Armémonos esta noche 

Y este amor crecerá 
En nuestros corazones 
Como una vida en otra vida 

Sera como una musa 
La mística que canta 
Lo bello del amor 
Lo bello del amor 

Nadie va a separarme de ti 
Este amor durara lo que viva yo 
Alto como las nubes 
Hondo como el mar 
Te declaro esta noche 
Lo que dice mi voz 
Mi voz",Esta Noche
Juanes,"Todo no ha sido perfecto 
En lo nuestro 
Pero han sido más los buenos momentos 
De lo nuestro 
Así es el amor de verdad 
Te enseña y es capaz de esperar 

Tantas noches extrañe un cariño 
Verdadero 
Tantas noches me bebí tu recuerdo 
En silencio 
Así es el amor de verdad 
Te enseña y es capaz de esperar 

Cuando el amor se aleja 
Como todo vuelve 
Las olas al mar 
El afán a la calma 

Nena, no voy a dejarte por un romance pasajero 
Tu eres el amor más bello y natural que tengo 

Olvida el pasado, te digo 
Vamos a comenzar de nuevo 
Tu eres el amor más bello y natural que tengo 
Olvida el pasado 

Ha sido tortuoso y violento, amor 

Volvamos a empezar 

Cuando el amor se aleja 
Oh
Cuando el amor se aleja 
Como todo vuelve 
Las olas al mar 
El afán a la calma 

Nena, no voy a dejarte por un romance pasajero 
Tu eres el amor más bello y natural que tengo 

Olvida el pasado, te digo 
Vamos a comenzar de nuevo 
Tu eres el amor más bello y natural que tengo 
Olvida el pasado 
Ha sido tortuoso y violento, amor 

Volvamos a empezar 
Volvamos a empezar",Lo Nuestro
Juanes,"Se derriten polo norte y sur
Nadie lo estaba esperando
Los delfines son aniquilados

New Orleans, Colombia, Cuba
Y Venezuela
Millones de niños en las calles

Pero no es una quimera

Oleada de terror
Bendita naturaleza

Mejor ahora que lamentar

Que no sabemos que va a pasar

Algún día todo tiene que cambiar
Amar de adentro hacia fuera

Juanes,"Un once de noviembre a las siete
De la noche
Hombres armados dispararon
Sin reproches
Contra la gente del municipio
De Segovia

Llovía cántaros la plaza estaba llena
Varias granadas estallaron en cadena
El nordeste antioqueno todo rojo
Se torno

Es una canción por los que se
Murieron allá en Segovia
Y por todas las familias que
Fueron victimas en Segovia
No van a desaparecer
Nunca jamás de la memoria
No van a desaparecer
Aunque los quieran desaparecer

Juanes,"Cada cosa me recuerda ti
Tu recuerdo va donde yo voy
No he podido escaparme al sabor del infierno
Que estoy viviendo ahora

Que te fuiste tan lejos de mi
Para otro mundo construir
Me cuesta tanto aceptarlo amor
Pero esto ya, se acabó

La soledad es un tipo de veneno
Que entra despacio y quema muy lento el corazón
Que no tiene remedio, que no, que no

Juanes,"Se que no puedo
Cambiar el mundo

Juanes,"Es tan difícil tenerte entre la vida y la muerte
Me duele que estés tan distante
Llevando desesperanza a todas partes

Te herí yo lo sé, perdona, te herí, yo lo sé
Mis ojos se ven cansados de llorar
La rabia de este amor

Y no regresas, y no regresas
No soy el mismo, sin tu amor

Me duele que estés en silencio
Hablemos sin hacernos preguntas
Hallemos el miedo

Te herí yo lo sé, perdona, te herí, yo lo sé
Mis ojos se ven cansados de llorar

Y no regresas, y no regresas
No soy el mismo, sin tu amor

No soy el mismo, sin tu amor",Y No Regresas
Juanes,"Azul
Busco un acorde azul
Un viento suave
Cuatro notas graves
Que me den las llaves de un Blues

Atrás, duele mirar atrás
Paisa, te acuerdas
Cada vez que pierdas
Date cuerda y vuelve a empezar
No seas una estatua de sal

Una canción con un mapa en la voz
Una canción mejor que tú y que yo
A flor de piel, una balada
Con miel tostada y mi sol

Acuérdate de olvidarte de mi
(Nunca de mí)
No dejes que te oxide el porvenir
(El porvenir)
No cuentes cuentas del rosario
De un corsario sin pedigree
No digas que no, porque sí

Cuando quieras escapar
En el barco de Peter Pan
A las playas de Robinson
Con un verso y un acordeón

Acuérdate de olvidarte de mi
(Nunca de mí)
No dejes que te oxide el porvenir
(El porvenir)
No cuentes cuentas del rosario
De un corsario sin pedigree

No digas que no, porque sí

Juanes,"Dame la fuerza y voluntad
Dame la señal que necesito ahora
Para calmar ésta pasión que ahoga y quiere salir

La luna llena me recuerda
Que vale la pena luchar por ti
Que vale la pena, que vale

Juanes,"Como una primavera que despierta la razón del día
La haces de inmenso tu amor
Como una noche que me roba y me rebosa de alegría
Como el silencio que divulgas cuando callas y me miras
Lo haces de inmenso tu amor
Como el café temprano donde mojo el pan de cada día
Conjugando las estrellas, coronando el firmamento
Derritiendo mis palabras con tu voz

Como un lenguaje indescifrable que me enseña y me da vida 
Así es de inmenso tu amor 
Como una luz que resplandece y me ilumina cada día 
Conjugando las estrellas, coronando el firmamento 
Derritiendo mis palabras, con tu voz

El parlamento de mis noches y tu
El violonchelo de este adagio en azul
Lluvia y verano eres tu
El horizonte de mi norte y sur
El calendario de mis besos de tul
Lo que poseo y lo que tengo eres tu

Juanes,"He buscado olvidarte y no he podido escapar
He intentado arrancar tu recuerdo en vano
Como una espina acariciando mi alma vas
Corazón invisible, eso soy para ti
Tú no sabes lo que me duele amarte
Como una espada atravesando mi pecho en silencio vas
Y por la espada que suave me atraviesa voy

Voy, voy camino hacia ti
Y aún no se si estoy preparado para decirte adiós
No lo sé aún no se si puede comenzar de nuevo, no
En mi desierto no hallo aliento más que tú
Qué difícil es decir adiós

Corazón invisible eso soy para ti
Bajo el mar mis palabras nadan
Como un amante que en silencio va borrando su andar
Y por la espada que suave me atraviesa voy

Voy, voy camino hacia ti
Y aún no se si estoy preparado para decirte adiós
No lo sé, aún no se si puede comenzar de nuevo, no
En mi desierto no hallo aliento más que tú
Qué difícil es decir adiós",Corazón Invisible
Juanes,"No me hablan las paredes
Soy un fantasma
Que se pierde en el laberinto de tu corazón
Delirando vivo por tu amor
Respirando tu silencio voy
En un viaje sin regreso

Me haces falta tú
¿Te hago falta yo?
Lo quisiera saber
La noche nunca estuvo tan hermosa
Los perros nunca ladraron así
La luna sobre la ciudad

Hay que saber cuando decir adiós
No ser entero contigo no
Estoy locamente enamorado de ti
Alguien como tú se merece lo mejor
Quizás yo no lo soy
Alguien que te pueda entregar el corazón
Quizás yo no lo soy

Me hipnotiza tu presencia
Soy un adicto a tus labios
Y me resisto a perderte
Me haces falta tú
¿Te hago falta yo?
Lo quisiera saber
La noche nunca estuvo tan hermosa
Los perros nunca ladraron así
La luna sobre la ciudad

Juanes,"Y en el Laberinto de mi alma
Donde la felicidad y el dolor

Y tu vestido negro tiene poca tela
La borrachera está muy buena
Yo sigo aquí bailando como las palmeras

Esta noche quiero ser tuyo
Esta noche he de ser tuyo
Esta noche voy a ser tuyo

Quiero morder tus labios como una aceituna
Bajo las sombre de las velas

Me fui de casa
Con una ilusión
Te perseguí de un sueño
Tras el sol

El cielo por mi cama
El hambre el pan de mi dolor
Por encima de mi orgullo
El polvo y el sudor
Me dieron fuerzas
Para continuar
En este viaje
Persiguiendo el Sol

Y cada paso lo hago
Cuesta más de lo que cuesta andar
Y solo así se aprende a caminar
Pero cueste lo que cueste andar
Por muy duro el caminar
Nada que se mueve más
Que lo que uno deja atrás
Soy aventurero y soñador
Persiguiendo el Sol
Aventurero y Soñador
Tal vez eso soy

Y mucho vi y poco soy
Entrego así mi corazón

Detrás del horizonte
Hay un horizonte más
En el que toda esperanza
Tiene otro color
Muy diferente
Del que imagine
Al perseguir sueño
Tras el Sol

Y cada paso lo hago cuesta aun más
De lo que cuesta andar
Que solo así se aprende a caminar
Pero cueste lo que cueste andar
Por muy duro el caminar
Nada que se mueve más
Que lo que uno deja atrás
Pero cueste lo que cueste andar
Por muy duro el caminar
Nada que se mueve más
Que lo que uno deja atrás
Soy aventurero y soñador
Persiguiendo el Sol
Aventurero y soñador
Tal vez eso soy",Persiguiendo el Sol
Juanes,"Con tú piel sobre mi piel
Y el amanecer
Sentí amarte tanto
Y hablábamos de los dos

Mientras Rolling Stones
Sonaba en el despertador
Can't always get what you want

Es hora de partir
Y quizá no puedo sonreír
Pero mi guitarra habla por mi

Para que todo esto
Sino estás tú aquí
Vinimos como una nube
Que la brisa se llevo deprisa
No se si tú estás
Pensando en mi
Pero ahora te digo que
Yo solo pienso en tí

En la cuerda floja estoy
Caminando voy
Perdiendo el equilibrio
Que alguna vez conocí

Es hora de partir
Y quizá no puedo sonreír
Pero mi guitarra habla por mi

Para que todo esto
Sino estás tú aquí
Vinimos como una nube
Que la brisa se llevo deprisa
No se si tú estás
Pensando en mi
Pero ahora te digo que
Yo solo pienso en tí

Para que todo esto

Dímelo de frente
Si me dices que me odias
Dilo cuando no este yo

Si te digo que ya se
Muy bien que tú me engañas
Si no tienes las agallas
Para venir a decirlo
No lo quiero saber

No es nada fácil olvidarte
Pero lo voy a hacer

Si me miras de frente
La verdad
Solo flor de piel
Flor de piel
Si te quedas despierta
Pégate
Contra la pared, la pared

Me pregunto si tal vez
Sabrás lo que se siente
Me pregunto si algo de esto
Pasa por tú mente hoy
No lo quiero saber

Te pregunto si cuando
Me encuentras en la calle
Te pregunto si te atreverías
A mirarme no
No, no lo quiero saber

No es nada fácil olvidarte
Pero lo voy a hacer

Happy golden days of yore

Hang a shining star
On the highest bough
And have yourself

Like a nightingale without a song to sing.

Hearing words I have never never heard,

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,

That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.

Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride

Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall

But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call

And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Now I see you standing with brown leaves all around and snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel over Washington Square
Our breath comes in white clouds, mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me we both could've died then and there

Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague

Cause I need some of that vagueness now 
It's all come back too clearly, yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust, I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Judas Priest,"The old man's sitting there, his head bowed down
Every now and then he'll take a look around
And his eyes reflect the memory-pain of years gone by
He can't regain nostalgic dreams he'll never see again

With trembling hands, he wipes a tear
Many fall like rain, there's one for every year
And his life laid out so clearly now, life that's brought death
So nearly now life once he clung to dearly now lets go 

But spare a thought as you pass him by
Take a closer look and you'll say
He's our tomorrow, just as much as we are his yesterday

A lonely grave, and soon forgot
Only wind and leaves lament his mournful song
Yet they shout his epitaph out clear
For anyone who's passing near
It names the person lying here as you
And you, and you, and you",Epitaph

So when the winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold
This rose reminds you of a time when all was warm and living

Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
'Til one day not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose buds I shall return

And all around seems dead and cold

All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
The spikey leather guys were foolin' with the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island

I cased the joint, straining at the seams

I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled give me a bourbon
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact
Then there he was, saw me and knew that

I'd had too much, foolin' around
Statues alive, seconds are hours

Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters

There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever

Judas Priest,"I traveled to a distant shore
I felt I had to go
An inner voice had called me there
But why I did not know
I saw the evening star rise up
Shining out to sea
And now I understand at last what it means
What it all means

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

I used to tempt fate
I couldn't see straight
I faltered through my younger days
Never knowing where I was going
Then something helped me penetrate the haze

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

Now I am stronger
The haze no longer
Ruins my future destiny
Such inspirations and new sensations
Pull up these string ties chasing me

Evening star I can see the light

The things that I have found
Much wiser now, so simple how

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, serving to my need
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout, I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion by

He's watchin' for a sign
His life is on the line
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins to toll
A storm begins to grow

Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest is scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives

Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

Sworn to avenge
Condemn to Hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel",The Sentinel

But you'll feel me
Without warning, somethings dawning, listen.
Then within your senses,
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other.

Then we race together.
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry.

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode.

Judas Priest,"It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all corners of the land

At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for

This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good

The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

Fast devastating and desolating the curse

Judas Priest,"Don't speak to me of morality
Justice wrong or right
You dig up the dirt ignore the hurt
And spit out all your lies

Conscience free as we bleed
Hypocrisy born from greed
Don't preach to me of integrity
Or your legal highs

The judge's thrilled
He's dressed to kill
On TV every night

Subliminal so absurd
It's criminal yet can't be heard

Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites

You will be on the stand today
They cannot harm you it's okay
But they will destroy your family
And drag you through hell and tragedy

A circus heading into town
Complete with cameras and the clowns
The First Amendment shot to bits
The world is watching just for kicks

As the day drew close to hand
For all to view the faceless man
He put out the lights it's sad
Now who's to blame for that?

Intimidate twist what you say
With their fine points of law
They lose the case but pontificate
And then appeal some more

Subliminal it's so absurd
It's criminal but can't be heard

Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites

Bloodsuckers how can they sleep at night
Bloodsuckers nothing but parasites

Promise to tell the truth
The whole truth
And nothing but the truth
So help me God!

You will be on the stand today
They cannot harm you it's okay
They will destroy your family
And drag you through hell and tragedy

Judas Priest,"So many years that we were one
So many things we've done
The memories alive
But most of me has died

As I struggle with events
I'm offered words of strength
They do not comprehend
The passion we possessed

People tell me what to do
Tell me how I should get through
But they haven't got a clue
No one else comes close to you

I see your eyes before they closed
They looked right inside my soul
And they asked me not to grieve
I tried but still I bleed

I wake up, I break up
Try hard to shake off
The desolation as it grows
As nothing else comes close

And as I stand here by the grave
And the wind calls out your name
I know that time could never heal
The emptiness I feel

People try to give me hope
Tell me how I should let go
But they'll never really know
'Cause there's nothing else comes close

People tell me what to do
Tell me how I should get through
But they haven't got a clue
No one else comes close to you",Close to You

In depth but also shallow

Where in deep sleep
There you lie still

Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend

Now you are mine
In my control

And I own your soul

Softly you stir
Gently you moan

Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white

When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay

Judas Priest,"Forged in the Black Country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit
Down to Holy Joe's
Used to lose our head while metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood won't let us die
We built our world of metal watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone

Gotta deal with the devil
'Cause you know that's it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

Rollin' down the M-Way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there 'til we all went broke
When we don the leather
And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more, we can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow into one voice
Took on the whole world it had no choice

Late at night
You're in our sight
Where we can feel what we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
On this stage, let it rage
For a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind",Deal With the Devil
Judas Priest,"Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth

Blood's on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring

Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regaled of his race
Prepare to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The Painkiller rises again

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to posses us
Out, demons out

Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's Gideon's quest
To take Satan's throne

The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminates all
When vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins to disintegrate
And pulverize all in it's wake

By the even tide on mass

That the story they will tell

A way to ease your mind
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust

I tried so hard to have you reach
Another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Desert heat can wear you down
But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze

I am driven by a thirst
To quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
Beckoned by the glow of kerosene and tumbleweed
They're calling out (They're calling out)
Forevermore (Forevermore)

I'm leaning in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for

I change the course of history
With premonitions from the void
Will you live, will you die
Will your worlds collide

I am Nostradamus
The hand of fate
I am Nostradamus
With love and hate

Lost in this vortex
The mystery begins
Will you be victim
Saved from your sins
Time is illusion
Trapped in the skies
Destiny's calling
Hear from my eyes

Many years ago a boy was born
A boy with a gift
A gift that would be the envy of all mankind
To see what no other could - great visions
Of the future
Or would a curse be bestowed on the boy
The boy whose name was Nostradamus,
Damus, damus, damus, damus, damus

I am Nostradamus
Do not forsake
I am Nostradamus
Your life's at stake

I am Nostradamus
The lightning rod
I am Nostradamus
The voice of God

Celestial comets
Reign towards earth
Alchemy's tempest
Predicting your worth
Pray for deliverance
Escape if you can
For I have borne witness
To the purging of man",Prophecy
Judas Priest,"As the evening comes to pass
I prepare myself to ask
Never knowing what may come
Oh! Oh!

Close the door and turn the key
Breathing in uncertainty
As my heart begins to race
Oh! Oh!

I see all things
From my mind's innocence
When they call me
I hear their prophecy

You say I must
Face my own deliverance
Did you choose me
Have I lost sanity

These eyes can see right through me
I feel your soul inside
What have you waiting for me
I'll do what you decide

And now this possession
Becomes my obsession
Adrift in illusion
I'm sent into confusion

Such torment and sadness
That overwhelms like madness
So fearful and intense
It burns inside

I'll spread the word
Around the world
My name will last
Eternally

I have the power
I have the choice
They'll hear my voice
For centuries

Pandora's Box is opened
Too late no turning round
A paradox has woken
I serve with honor bound

I take this possession
And make it my obsession
Alive in illusion
To make sense from confusion

Come torment come sadness
Give me the joy of madness
This fear and this intent
Runs deep inside

This deepest possession
For my life
I want this obsession
In my life
I claim this possession
Take my life",Revelations

And all the world must be aware

Embers ignite once again
I watch them dance around the flame

The shadows taunt as if to dare
Ghostly embrace takes my heart
Now I surrender and it starts

Show me what is right
Help me through the maze of mystery

Turns the page
It never ceases to amaze
Fill me with hope if you can
I will become a better man

And tell the future of mankind

There's nothing I can do (There's nothing I can do)

Such a lonely night
Premonitions running wild
I can see them now
All alone I fantasize

As daylight breaks
Through the stars
I wonder how I got this far
As I leave my room
And lock the door
I know I'll live forever more

Judas Priest,"Hail the hero coming home
Honor bound from whence he roamed
Fortitude and skill
Call of duty all alone

Lead the nation for the crown
Serve the orders coming down
Charge ahead with pride
Guard the chivalry you've shown

Those forsaken reawakened with my battle cry

Indestructible by choice
Valor rings out with the voice
Rail the consequence
Destiny's the flag you hoist

Your endeavor lives forever with my battle cry

Cast this sorrow to the wind

Let tomorrow be the light you're made to herald in

And as I reach up to the sky

Erasing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And so we'll rise
By the grace of God alone
His words are carved in stone

I'm never gone
I'll always be within your heart
Waiting's the worst part
Now the voices are calling me
Soothing me and easing the pain and the fear

So lay me down
Lay me to rest
It's over now 'cause I know
It's the beginning of the end

And I see my life pass quickly by
I am watching
All these years we thought we were so wise
They mean nothing

Walk alone into the dying mist come alive for ever
See the things we've never seen before
Hand in hand together

They galling rays are lighting up the open door
We've all been waiting for
All the voices are calling me
Showing the path that is clear

It's the beginning

Fatality waits in the wings
Surrounded by fools behind walls that are breached
Beware of the jester that sings

Stand tall rise up stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find it's reward

The whispers can't hide when the tongues are let loose
Then hiding the truth is absurd
A stab in the back or taste of the noose
Is when action speaks louder than words

Jude,"I asked you for a ride I was lonely
And hoping to see you before you left town
You said ""I'm sorry I'd like to
If only I had had the time maybe next time around""

And I walked for miles and carried my bags
On streets with no sidewalks in search of a ride
It was me and a Baby Ruth
A chewy chunk of chocolate truth
And here from the bus I would like to say thanks
Thank you

And muffins maybe some cinnamon toast

Thanks a lot
Thank you - not

An angel is peering at me now from under a book
She catches me staring and smiles to the window
Again I'm in love and with only a look

And it must be it's true I am free
And last night a bird you know who spoke to me
Saying welcome the solitude it's your family tree
And you would've been
Only a heaven

At noon I will fly to my city my prison
And you will be forever gone from my life
And soon I'll deny any lingering vision
Of me in some catalogue and you as my wife

'Cause I walked for miles in search of a ride
On streets with no sidewalks and steep muddy banks

A chewy chunk of chocolate truth
And here from the bus I'd just like to say thanks

Only in love with you
But I guess I'll never be whole
And you know it's true
It does not stop me that we all die
I know this trip's to slaughter
But if only I could let me cry
I feel the healing water roll down

I will not die
Down I will not die
Down I will not die",Charlie Says
Jude,"George died in the fifth grade 
No one ever knew why 
He was out selling lemonade 
On the Fourth of July, and he died 

Sister Claire said that he was 
An angel on Earth 
She stood there and she told us 
She had clearly rehearsed every verse 
Of the lies that tie you down 

And I've forgotten my first love 
I haven't seen her since when 
But there's a bum on the corner 
He thinks that I'm his best friend, we pretend 

He says the rapture is any day 
That's when God's coming down 
Although perhaps He should stay away 
They'll run him right out of town, like a clown
With the lies that tie you down

There are times when a man feels 
That it's him against the world 
There are times when a man steals 
From the love of his girl 

There are days when a beast dies 
Long before the gun 
And there are days when a crow flies 
Straight into the sun, to be done 
With the lies that tie you down

The lies that tie you down
The lies that tie you down

Nineteen ninety...
Nineteen ninety-nine

Jude,"Well I knew a dealer, Dan, and he'd say 
""Don't worry 'bout me - 
I'm never gonna fit the plan 
And I'll never work for free"" 
And then he spent some time in a State Penitentiary 
I believe he made ten cents an hour 
And I knew a girl in college 
Sweet as the summer sun 
Never worried 'bout books and knowledge 
She was having too much fun 
And I hear these days she's living at home with a three year old son 
Reading up on women taking power 
The trees grow high 
and the leaves they grow green 
And me oh my all the things that I have seen 
Don't be surprised little bro 
When the world turns out mean 
Life is what happens In Between 
Well I know a man, old man, about ninety five 
He could hardly see nor stand
But he was goddamn glad to be alive 
And he said, ""Hey son go and taste of life! 
Get in your car and drive."" 
And that's exactly what I do 
But out here on the road
You know a man leads a simple life
Don't carry no heavy loads 
Ad he don't get time for the lady or a wife 
But sometimes the stars aren't fallin' 
Oh no they don't shine so bright 
And that's when I wish I was home with you 
The trees they grow high 
And the leaves they grow green 
And me oh my all the things that I have seen
Don't be surprised little bro 
When the world turns out mean 
Life is what happens In Between 
Well you remember our dad, remember what he said?
He said, ""This here's a family, 
Gonna be together 'til we're dead"" 
Ten years and two homes ago 
It ain't quite what turned out to be 
And I still hear those words 
They ring and ring and ring inside of me 
The trees grow high 
And the leaves they grow green 
And me oh my all the things that I have seen 
Don't be surprised little bro 
When the world turns out mean 
Life is what happens In Between

Jude,"She was a faker
I was a fool 
I tried to make her
I broke the rule 

And over coffee 
On the morning next 
I learned the rest 
Had regrets

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lays me down, down 
But my God will still come around around 

He was a salesman
I was a fool 
He had retirement 
I had a stool 

And over bourbon 
And a Coca Cola 
I fought the bad guy 
And I kept my soul 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life can lay me down down 
But my God will still come around around around around around 

And it's a full house flush 
With a bass and a brush 
And a subtle soft shade 
Of the cheekbone blade 

And the world turns around 
The sun which is found 
To be casually gunning
For life overrunning 
In heels 
He squeals and reveals 
God don't cut deals 

He was a savior
I was a child 
Programmed behavior 
And a Santa smile 

And over red wine 
And a little bread 
We commune with the divine 
And the diva in the priest-suit said 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Boy life lay you down, down 
But my God will still come around around around around around 

And it's a drag queen sheriff of a ghost town 
Probably since the last days of hate
When the mushroom clouds came down 
Smoke signaling too late 
And CNN broke the blow dry grip 
For a flash of the end - like it's some hot tip 

And God
If the last voice I hear on that community screen
Sounds deeper than Yours and doubly as mean
Then the Jedi knight was right 

Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lay you down 
Life can lay me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lays me down 
Life lay me right down oh now down 
Life can lay me down 
Life can lay me down 
Life can lay me down down down down 
Life can lay me down 
So hard sometimes I even sing light jazz fusion 

And it's a full house flush 
With a bass and a brush 
And a subtle soft shade 
Of the cheekbone blade 

And the world turns around 
The sun which is found 
To be casually gunning
For life overrunning

Jude,"Way down in soho town 
Where the lovely people love to be 
And they all write all their best lines down 
And they hope their hair turns white like Andy 
There's a man who was almost king 
He was lionized when they left the ring
And some time away was soon the end

I can't go back, but I know I should

Chucky's in love with a friend 
You can fall in the arms of each other 
And nothing is like that brother 
And Love, I know you're gone for good 
I can't go back, but I know I should 
Love is larger than letters 
Taking up his sword again 
It was a Mont-Blanc monogrammed pen 
And he wielded the power of his PHD 
While he sat there 
And glouded his green screen tragedy

Jude,"I heard nothing but the empty slap of words
That was all I heard when you spoke to me

And I ... I laugh at you

I had much more than I wanted

And yet we are turds of great colossal birds

Hey, hey baby, we've gotta get out of L.A. 

I met a girl who looked like a movie star 
She was going for a ride and I don't mean in a car

With the objects in my home
I am caressed by my razor
And so am not alone

I spoon an over-sized pillow
I bought for such a use
And to the flowers in my garden
I am lover not recluse

If you, my dear, were such a flower
You would stay and only grow
And I would tend to you and water, baby
And straight up would you go

You would spread and maybe blossom
With each passing summer's day
And not the suitors from a hundred hives
Could draw your love away

Then as autumn shut the light 
Down in advance of winter's bite
According to true lover's creed
You would not die but go to seed

For so it is with paper towels
And other things about my place
The old begets the new
And the things I need keep up to pace

But you, my dear, you're gone forever
You left no silly seed behind
Save a rotten pit it lingers
Cherry tombstone in my mind

You're not a paper towel
You're like the wind goes howling

You fled as if the autumn grays
Were the heralds of final days
Uprooting with your seeds and all
Cruel harvest of love's first fall

You're not a paper towel (no, no)
You're like the wind goes howling (howl)

The walk of fame,
The Japanese,
Their up against, their trying
To match the hand sizes with the household names,
And I just try to bob and weave,
And keep from bumpin into furry,
Fairy prostitutes, and make it to the corner,
Gonna lose myself inside,

I kneel and kiss the ground you were such a prophet then to me,

To supplicate is not the way,
You gotta put the other man down on his knees,
But that's not why I arrived, no,
That was not the reason,
Don't mind if I retire from a town without one,
Just like a season

I remember when I first had come to town, and you suggested,

In counter time to your piercing cameras before me,
Moving closer I've come to know that there's nothing in there toshow me,
Pretty good show she said,
I kinda like your style,
Well maybe we could go to bed,
And I can help you run the three minute mile,
But first you got to take the drinks,
You gotta learn to fake the smiles,

And beaten up and beaten down 
Who'd I run to mama tell me who 

And as I grew to be a man 
And all the world held such elan 
I did what I thought I just had to do 

It was you mama you, it was you all along
It was you I ran away from I was wrong 
And if I could I'd change my life 
I swear to God I'd cut it out with a knife 
And with a glue stick I'd reapply it in a song

And laid back Kerouac never no a heart attack 
Drinking and thinking about the place he ran back to 
The moloch is an old man the moloch is a love-lack 
Bending for a quick snack remembering his friend Jack 
And mama sometimes I remember you 

It was you mama you, it was you all along
It was you I ran away from I was wrong 
And if I could I'd change my life 
I swear to God I'd cut it out with a knife

Mother loves child 
Sometimes I call my lady mama 
So I can feel at home for a while 
So I can feel at home for a while 

Looking around at all the Mellencamp towns
The excuses and the nooses where the coffee grounds 
I found places and traces of a storybook world 
And I went out there for a ride 
On the misty coast but the holy host 
Is under Mickey D's American flag and it's unfurled 

It was you mama you, it was you all along
It was you I ran away from I was wrong

For a groom without a pearl or a diamond on his mind
Did you think that for a second on the brink 
That you could let me take a drink and bet that would not climb inside over my
Primly pride
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
See you walking down the hall kinda tall it isn't all like Bacall and
I'm gonna pucker up and blow you right out of the seams of your suits and the
Dreams will be roots for the teams in cahoots

There is only so much I can give without return
Maybe a song
Maybe a few
Maybe not
Maybe, finally fuck it and just take a shot

I would crawl back to you and say thanks I needed that
It's been a while
I would crawl back to you and say thanks I needed that
It's been a while
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Smoother skinned than most she was and beautiful and just because I thought I'd 
Be a doomsday gift I placed the rift
Callous first and cavalier dropping verses she could hear the sad refrain
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

It's my rope and my asp and my doom for my lusting of you
Throw me a thin spider line, I'll be fine, as I climb the mine to my divine

Now, you're going straight to Hell and that's where your story ends

Well, one of those girls was a friend of mine
One of those ones you took
One of those girls didn't want to see her face on the cover of a dirty book
One of those girls took her life last night just in case you had not heard

Were all the ones I spent with you. 

I would give anything I own. Give up my life and my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own, just to have you back again.

You may lose them one day. Someone takes them away and they'll never hear the words you have to say.

the things you cling to
Your heart can start to grow.

You, you're walking away.
I've been there now I know what to say I'm the king of
yesterday.

A silly little love song for myself.
It's all I ever do you know I shine the shell.
A pretty little picture, the face of you.
You were my setting sun and now you're every view.

You, you're walking away
I've been there now I know what to say
I'm the king of yesterday.

Why don't, why don't, why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay? why don't you stay? why don't you stay?

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You are the one that I want.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You were the one that I wanted.

And someday I'll be over on my own.
Believing all the legends of the loves I've known

And seeing you in summer the way we were when you were seventeen
You know I much preferred you walking away.

I've been here, now I know what to say
I'm the king of yesterday.

Why don't, why don't, why don't you stay?
Why don't you stay? why don't you stay with me? stay.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You are the one that I want.

Take a little time, throw it on the line.
Let me believe that you believe in me.
Baby turn around, look at what I found.
You were the one that I wanted.

And the world was in her closet while she dressed for her groom.

There were angels above her and furs on the floor.

And with the nose of a reindeer, the skin of a plum.
But now she'll be lovely, forever look dumb.

It never meant that much to me but now I understand. 

The way you walked away from your commitments and your promises.
You know how to play the game you'll never know the way to be a man. 

Oh boy you'll never be the man now.
Oh boy, you want to be a star, yeah.
Oh boy, you're only Peter Pan now.
And you depend on everyone to tell the world exactly what you are. 

Well 26 has come and gone, more quickly than it came to you.
Everything you've done before is only in the past. 

Well, you should keep a gun nearby, I hope you get the courage.
Dying young is the only way you're ever going to last. 

[Chorus] 
You've been fucking for fame since you were 16, everybody knows.
Stolen kisses, something's missing, hey man come or go. 

I'll see you at the show. 
Oh boy, I see you with your friends now.
Oh boy, pretending you're a star, yeah.
Oh boy, there's no way you can hurt me now.

And stares at me
These two teeth are
Gone as you can see
I don't know just who
To blame for this catastrophe
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
Is as plain as it can be

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth
My two front teeth
See my two front teeth

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could with you
""Merry Christmas.""
It seems so long since I could say
""Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!""

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be
If I could only whistle (thh)

Have my two front teeth

Jude Cole,"I'm in the mood for a sad song, one that cries on it's own
And we can sing it together, so I don't cry all alone
Seems I don't know where to go, since she went away
And the room's spinning faster, as the record plays
It's the one that reminds me of much better days
I'm in the mood for a memory, one that lives on and on
If I relive the laughter, then it won't feel like she's gone
I can't remember when I smiled, since she went away
I keep reaching behind me, today's so hard to face
And the silence reminds me of much better days
And it's too long to morning, since she's not in my sights
She's the one that could move me, but she's out of sight
Why am I holding on, I should let it fade
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days",Better Days
Jude Cole,"I knew Mary when she was a baby
One little girl and one big little man
Five years younger, she cried like the thunder
I watched her reach ten and never saw her again
From one boys home to one prison cell
Mary I've known this world's bitter hell
But come this winter I'll see my parole
And watch the heads turn, down the aisle we stroll

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
But she left a picture of you at seventeen
And every day since then, Mary you have been my dream

For years I've waited, alone in the dark
Thinking of you through a young boy's heart
Over and over, the price that I've paid
Was watching you cry as they drove me away

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
So many times I've wondered, behind these doors
Will we be together, the way it used to be
Now that you are older, Mary do you think of me

Are you still Crying Mary, the girl I knew before
Your mama used to come here, she don't come no more
Just this worn out picture that carries everything
But there's no way of knowing, Mary do you think of me

Do you think of me Mary",Crying Mary
Jude Cole,"To watch her walk away was all that I could take
I had to stop my feet from making a fool of me
Now I make a point of staying far away
From this kind of activity
'Cause every time I try, I find I'm only losing heart
And I start to wonder why

Everyone's in love, isn't that enough
Love, stay away from me

So watch me walk away, call it a draw and say
Goodbye Shangri-La, your beauty is lost on me
I don't see the point of going through obsession
Just for some intimacy
'Cause I just want to go sit back in an easy chair
And watch the next guy try

Everyone's in love, isn't that enough
Love, stay away from me
Everyone's in love, isn't that enough (I don't get it)
Love, stay away from me

Does anybody see the same thing I see
Making history instead of making love
And I haven't a hope if I'm gonna get the girl
By giving up the world
But I've done it over and over again
I'm just gonna go kick back in an easy chair
And watch and wonder why

Jude Cole,"What happened to Joey the strong believer
He was a real straight shooter, but he got the fever
Now he's cruisin' the downtown queen of the city
With a feel for the street and he's dressing pretty
'Cause when she left him behind, something inside said no more
There's a price to pay when you play with the little town flirt
And ooh, baby that's the hurt
What happened to Sally, she's so nervous
Does she need a love or a mental service
All the boys just leave her poor heart achin'
But she can't look back now, Joey's taken
So the time rolls by, 'til something inside says no more
There's a price to pay when you can't keep away from the dirt
And ooh, baby that's the hurt
Someone's always telling lies
Someone's always got something to hide, now don't they
Someone's running and someone's reaching

And the lonely nights just wrap around my soul
'Cause you've broken every promise that you ever made to me
Trading dreams for a life of luxury

So I met a girl and knew it wasn't love
But knowing that she didn't mind
Made it easy to be kind
A lover's surrender, a room for a homeless heart
Never being aware
That every moment you were there

'Cause the fool inside my heart won't let it go
And it's tearing me apart to let it show
'Cause you're broken every promise that you ever made to me
Trading dreams for a life of luxury

(You can't wait forever, and now you know
Don't ever regret her, just let her go)
But I can't, I can't, I just can't hold back

Do we learn from our mistakes
Is there anyone awake
Show me you're not on the take

Show me there is still a prayer

Show me, is there someone there

And your red dress
In the afternoon
The sun shines on Temple Street
And all the Mexicans
Smile freedom
But you're not like them
You got a heart of black ink

Walkin' beautiful

That could paint them silly
And I don't care if it's good or evil

Since I met you I'm a stranger to myself

Jude Cole,"I sat on the roof as the night came down
Looking out over this pitiful town
And thought of you out there
Back in the race
Looking for someone to take my place
That's when it hit me
That's when the walls came down
You see, I never thought it could happen to us
Now we're going 'round
Breaking down each other's hearts
So go on and blame me for whatever you must
But we've become just like the ones
We laughed about
This time, well this time it's us
Up in a watchtower with the streetlights below
In a town full of places that we used to go
And a river of people walking two by two
Everything I see now reminds me of you

That's when it all came true

We can't hide what we both know

Every time I think it's over

You've been keeping all your secrets inside
I know the truth now baby
You don't have to hide, no no no

What a shame things had to turn out this way

Oh, it's time for letting go
We can't hide what we both know
But ooh, the hurt grows

One September in the pouring rain
A midnight flyer, and a girl named Lori Rose

She'll be gone when you're out of cash

All your life you run to love
You give your heart then it's not enough
Buy hey babe, that's the way it goes

So Romeo in a G.T.O.
Met Juliette at the drive-in show
Midnight dreamin' down the Texas coast
We stopped to wish upon a star
She stole my breath, she stole my car
But hey baby, it's just the way it goes

Every time that your heart breaks
You swear you won't make the same mistakes
But hey baby, that's the way it goes
First your money, then your clothes

Oh no, love ain't cheap
There's a toll booth up on Lover's Leap
Sweet romance take a chance
Come and dance with me

I'm ridin' out on a Southbound train
Just a Romeo in the pouring rain

Burning out of control

So lock your doors up tight
And say a prayer tonight
You know it's hard to keep the demons down
When it comes around

In the darkness of your room
While you're drinking to your past
And livin' your cartoon
Deep down in the gutter
They're calling your name

And you were such a pretty woman
Those were the days
One thing's for sure in this town, baby
Being pretty pays
But all the fame and riches
Gonna turn out to be Fool's gold
When you look to find shelter in
The ones you bought and sold

So sad, so alone
It cuts right to the bone
When you find out how it feels to hit the ground
When it comes around

Turn it off, man, I've seen too much
You better look over your shoulder, honey
You're losin' your touch
Deep down in the gutter
Or up on the stage

It comes around and around and around
So lock your doors up tight
Say a little prayer tonight

Like a lighthouse in the sky
And let these eighteen wheels fly
I woke up this morning
In a Motel 5
Brokenhearted, I'm gonna drive through the night
Down the open road

I asked her where we stood
She said Johnny, this ain't no good
You made the highway your home
And I'm just tired of livin' alone
So you go your way
And I'll go mine
And maybe one day you'll find what you're looking for

I've been down this road many a time
And Lord I've tried to find
Some peace of heart, some peace of mind
But this road just winds and winds...

She could take away my homesick blues
And lately I feel a little crazy too
Yes I do, Ma'am, yes I do
Got a dobule sleeper
I'm hell on wheels
Come on sweet thing, show me how love feels

Back in high school days
Living for freedom
And not for the A's

On graduation day
Hoping someday I'd find

Down in the old watertown
Hear the train whistle blowin'

Going nowhere soon
With a dream and a beat-up six-string
You're just howling at the moon

Sail above the clouds
Faith keep me from falling
And I swear I won't look down

Factories were shutting down
But we were rock and roll stars
To all the watered-down bars
And teenage brides in wedding gowns

And oh, the bomb went off right in his face
Oh, he wears the scars with grace

But if you ever make your mind up

Jude Cole,"Like ghosts on open windows,
The curtains rise and fall.
The past is a foreign country
At the dark end of the hall,
And the morning is an offering
To the shelter of the day.
But the violent come, and they bury it away.
Time goes by at the speed of life,
Slower than a slow dance on a hot summer night.
Faster than the skin breaks on the edge of a knife,
And we just go on at the speed of life.
Like questions begging answers,
The stars appear at night.
What's it mean to love somebody?
What's it mean to be alive?
I heard a little girl laughing
At her first sight of snow;
Saw an old man dying
In a room he didn't know.
While the world turns through the ages,
It's a most peculiar ride.
Holding on to one another,
Moving at the speed of life.
We just go on at the speed of life.
A family on the midway, in the carnival lights,
Moving in a circle through the sounds and the sights,
And it all goes by at the speed of life.

Time goes by at the speed of life,
Slower than a slow dance on a hot summer night.
Faster than the skin breaks, baby,
On the edge of a knife,
And we just go on, and on, at the speed of life.
Moving at the speed of life.
Speed of life.
On and on, and on, and on.
On and on, and on, and on.",Speed of Life
Jude Cole,"Liven up, loose the chains
It's hard to lie down in the driving rain
I lost a job I thought I had
My friends say maybe that ain't so bad
You gotta lose boy to learn to win
Life's just a game I'll never understand

But the ride is rough
And you fall, you better get back up
Take the reins by the hand
And learn to fall like a man

My baby called from the south of France
Said I know what you want buddy
But there ain't no chance
I finally found my pot of gold
And what you hide man, is yours to hold
Well baby darlin', I'm just a man
And love's just a game I'll never understand

And when you fall, you better get back up

Of all the words you think you mean

By the look on your face
You ain't lovin' me

For you now
Is hang around
And remind you of
The lies you tell
For your picture perfect private hell

Baby be true
To your heart and mind
Just this once
And for old times
'Cause I've had enough
Of spending all my days in doubt

Why you want to hurt so bad
Why don't you take a deep breath

I would take back nothing
Not a single step away from here

With a simple wish in these violent times
To dream of yours, peaceful in mine

Innocent strangers, eternal friends
In a world of our very own
Far from space and time

Leaves every afternoon
And funny little cars

Judee Sill,"I've been lookin for someone
Who sells truth by the pound
The I saw the dealer and his friend
Arrive, but their gifts looked grim.
Now I'm tired of hanging on,
Waitin' for a showdown
Don't y'see I gotta ride 'em out
Cuz the pearls' just around the bend
Beautiful pearl, o when will you reappear?
Mysterious unfurl and become so clear,
When I feel you near...
I found a way outside myself
To make my spirit climb,
And I culda shinnied on up
But my rope was made of wind
I appreciate the words,
But I won't be there at showtime
Don't y'see I gotta ride them out
Cuz the pearl's just around the bend
Beautiful pearl, o when will you reappear?
Mysterious unfurl and become so clear,
When I feel you near...
When my backyard weeds grew high,
I hoped that they would hide me,
But I felt that the pearl was near
Cuz I thought I saw it shine,
I was lookin' all around
When I felt it there inside me
And I see a possibility
That its been there all the time...",The Pearl
Judee Sill,"The sun was red, and the fires were roarin'
Stars aligned and the webs were spun
I coulda sworn I heard my spirit soarin'
Guess I'm always chasin' the sun
Hopin' we will soon be one
Until it turns around to me, then I try to run…

On phosphorous wings the phoenix floated
The fires froze and the sea was hushed
And when I tried to speak, the sun imploded
And the war will wage in my guts
Till the Devil bites the dust,
I never say him losin' a race, but I think he must…

The great storm raged and the power kept growin'
Dragons rose from the land below
And even now I wonder where I'm goin'
Ever since a long time ago
I've tried to let my feelings show
I'd like to think I'm bein' sincere, but I'll never know…

(repeat 1st verse)",The Phoenix
Judee Sill,"There's a rugged road on the prairie
Stretchin' all across the last frontier
There a stranger strives solitary
Blessed is the lonesome pioneer

Roll on, roll on, roll on, night birds are flyin'
Come on, the light is gone, hope's slowly dyin'
Tell me how you come ridin' through
Still surveyin' the miles yet to run
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come

He can blaze a trail, though the rumblin'
Dims his guiding light to just a spark
When the hour is low, he comes tumblin'
When the moon is high he gives his heart

Roll on, roll on, roll on, night birds are flyin'
Come on, the light is gone, hope's slowly dyin'
Tell me how you come ridin' through
Gainin' steady till this round is won
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come

People far below chasin' pleasures
Offer him directions on the run
Prophets on the path offer treasures
Though she's mighty hungry he takes none

Roll on, roll on, roll on, night birds are flyin'
Come on, the light is gone, hope's slowly dyin'
Tell me how you come ridin' through
Blindly faithful but followin' none
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come

When the sun goes down at the right time
She comes windin' through the purple haze
Just a feather's touch in the night time
But it'll color all my weary days

Shinin' finer than this earthly sun
On the ragged, rugged road to kingdom come
On the ragged, rugged road to kingdom come

",There's a Rugged Road
Judee Sill,"I've heard the waterfall roaring again
Since I've been lovin' you
With my poor heart in my throat I begin
Living a dream come true
Tumblin' down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
On the edge trembling, I totter
My fate unknown
But my fear has flown

Cause' your love came to lead me home
Waterfall song in my head
Prasin' its thunderous swords
Just as my heart praises you and me here
True love's the wondrous force
Tumblin' down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
Rumbling gravity falters
Since dawn has shown
How nice overthrown
And love comes to lead us home
From a small trickle it grows
Watching a waiting front
Til its momentum will carry the flow
Over the rushing falls
Tumbling down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
Pass the sun's rays growin' hotter
The cascades drones 
Through glistening falls
Like love comes to lead us home",Waterfall

And I do not want to give this injection

I am not a qualified physician
And I do not want to give this injection

Dorothy's begging for trouble
She is insisting I give her this needle
Darling one thing I want you to know
Don't blame me for where the needle goes

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

She lied down in such a position
It was difficult to give this injection
She starts holding on to the needle
Making me so uncomfortable
I said 'darling, can't you be steady,
I'm going to have it in very shortly'
She said 'Dr. Kitch I am sorry,
But the sight of the needle frightens me'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

She still wouldn't lie down quietly
Constantly moving her body
So I slap her in the face with vexation
And go on giving the injection
She screams 'Doctor stop it, I can't stand the pain,
I don't think your inside the right vein'
I said 'You little fool you wouldn't be told,
The needle must be sticking in the wrong hole!'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:
""Dr. Kitch, you are terrible,
I can't stand the sight of your needle.""

I pull it from the hole and start again
I have the needle now in the right vein
The needle's just in half an inch
The stupid young lady start to flinch
Suddenly she calls 'Doc it's working!
I can feel the pennicilin going in'
I said 'You silly fool, look what you do
The needle's gonna break inside of you!'

I push it in, she pulls it out
I push it back, she starts to shout:

Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound

A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears

Pretend that I'll make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

That love is blind and your heart will not grow old

I hate to tell you, I hate to cry
But my mouth keeps moving while the tears roll from my eyes

Now every evening I feel cold
'Cause all I know is what I'm told

You can watch me moving faster
You can ask me where I'll go
But baby, don't expect an answer
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

In the winter I feel warm
'Cause I relate to the freezing falling storms

Now I could tell you what I mean
But I don't know what I believe

You can watch me moving faster
You can ask me where I'll go
But baby, don't expect an answer
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I don't know where to go
I, I wish I had a heart to follow
I don't know what to know

it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show

but ain't too much sadder than

smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown

Judi Connelli,"Tell me where
Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly!",Piece of Sky [From Yentl]

Judi Connelli,"Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say
In all the words, in all the books
I wish there were a way to say that
What she's taught me
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
Who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she 
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last!
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside
Is getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise it won't be the same
Anymore!
",No Matter What Happens
Judi Connelli,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening [From South Pacific]

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Und nimmst deine Schuh

Deine perfekten Katastrophen nimm gleich
Mit
Seit ich dich kenne, verfolgst du mich
Auf Schritt und Tritt
Ich weiß, du planst für mich ein Ende
Von fast biblischer Gewalt
Aber John, John, John
Ich werd lieber alt

Judith Holofernes,"Du sagst, ich fühl mich heute nicht so gut
Ich sag, Mann, reiß dich zusammen
Du sagst, dass dir der Kopf wehtut
Ich sag, meiner steht in Flammen
Und du sagst, du bist so müde
Ich sag, mir ist schlecht

Das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe
Jetzt erst recht

Du fragst, wie hast du geschlafen
Ich sag, weniger als du
Du sagst, weniger als gar nicht
Aber ich hab schon die Augen zu
Und du sagst, du bist so müde
Ich sag, das ist schlecht

Das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe
Jetzt erst recht

Du sagst, komm, wir schieben heute alles
Den Kindern in die Schuhe
Du sagst, ich sehe doch toll aus
Ich sag, Mann, lass mich in Ruh' ich sag
Ich bin so müde du sagst ist dir Recht

Du willst Liebe, du willst Liebe
Jetzt erst Recht

Und ich liebe dich, ich lieb dich
Jetzt erst recht

Das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe

Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Running over the same old ground

Your memory comforts me.
In the darkness, when I'm frightened,
I can see in my dreams.

Though I'm far dear, though were parted,
I know that time can change nothing.
So if you feel afraid, and if your hope is gone,
Just remember all these things I promise you. 

I will move heaven,
I will move hell and earth to be where you are.
I will move heaven,
And it might take my life,
It might take forever,
But I promise you.

As I sail through, stormy seas dear,
You come to still my heart.
As I walk through, a path of danger,
You lead me through the dark.

Though I'm far dear, and though were parted,
I know that time can change nothing.
So if you feel alone, and if your faith is gone,
Just remember all these things I promised you.

I will move heaven,
I will move hell and earth to be where you are.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

Oh! Will you never set me free?

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace that fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home.

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear.

Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free
No, there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me.

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me

Judy Allen,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Who knows the status of my soul 
Measures the merit of my mind
 
[Chorus: ]

As life and death conflict and need 
Feature in all reality 
More than a common ground I see 
One race that is humanity 
And though the future's overcast 
Still I am hoping anyhow 
We've got to look beyond the past 
It is the time for healing now",Between You and Me
Judy Bailey,"Lately I've been living 
Did a check on my heart and I can feel it beating now 
Never had the attention 
Never thought anyone would give up all their time 
Never thought I could hold the interest of someone like You 
Never thought anyone could satisfy or please me like You do 
Do it again do it again 
Not many people look deeper 
Or have the desire the patience the tools to dig down anyway 
Not many get to see the real me and still want to know 
Not many would tolerate my swings or mind my moods 
I've had imitations 
I've had a few good tries 
Had a few good intentions but few came true 
Few came through 
Only You only You only You only You 
Bridge 
I love the way You love me 
Please don't stop now 
I love the way You love me now 
I could get used to this 
To just having You near me 
To having Your arms wrapped around me 
Just being there 
Feel Your breath on my cheek Your gaze on my face 
And all the while You make me smile 
With the words that You whisper in my ear 
It's plain to tell You know me well 
You say the things that I love to hear 
Calm into my turbulence and bringing hope to my despair 
Comfort to my restlessness and reassurance to my fear
Do it again do it again 
Feels nice oh feels nice 
It's gotta be love love 
It feels nice oh feels nice 
I love the way You're i love the way You're 
I love the way you're mine 
I love the way you're I love the way You're mine

How You reach me thrill me meet me

Judy Bailey,"Talk is cheap in times like this 
Children die mothers cry 
You and I talking about the way it is 
All around see the signs 
To my shame I just play the caring game 
Talking about the way it is 

[Chorus] 
Gonna need some courage to practice what I preach 
Gonna need some love to carry it over 
If I didn't have words would I be what I say I believe 
Don't just keep talking about it 
Don't just keep talking about the way it is 
Don't just keep talking about it 
Don't just keep talking about the way it is
I'm saying more and doing less 
I criticize analyze I'm paralyzed 
Talking about the way it is 
And the feelings gone now 
Funny how my heart is much harder now 
Talking about the way it is

Judy Bailey,"More life more love more peace when I give it up
We will not be free until we fix our minds on the Almighty 
We will never see unless we look to the Lord 
We won't find ourselves 
Until we lose our drive for earthly ambition 
We will never live until we die to this world 
More life more love more peace when I give it up
We will never learn 
Until we run to the Father like little children 
Change will never come until we're rooted in Him 
We won't win this race 
Until we stumble realizing our weakness 
We can't lift our heads up 
Until we humble our hearts and give Him all the praises 
More life more love more peace when I give it up 
Give it up give it up give it up give it up 
I get the meaning when i give it up
More life more love more peace when I give it up

0h yeah yeah wo yay oh 
Songs of freedom songs that save my soul
Ancient echoes of my past bring light and life to me 
The same old song that my mother sang 
Was a song that set me free
 
Deep in the night she would rock her child singing over me 
The very same song her mother sang the prayers of centuries 
The cry was freedom all the way 
Feel it in the music hear it in the words I sing 

[Chorus: ] 

And when the pain of yesterday plagues my memory 
My song is a light to chase the lies
The past is telling me 
I lift my head up to the sky and suddenly I see 
I know the truth, I know myself 
And I know my destiny 

The cry is freedom all the way 
Feel it in the music hear it in the words I sing

Judy Barnett,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

One gentle kiss, please, please

I want some mellow loving

Waiting for one little touch
Can't you see that I'm a woman
And I'm hungry
Can't you see what I need

One day the devil came down to his plow

And off to hell with her in a pack

He set her down at the fork in the road
O daddy be gay

He said old woman you're a hell of a load

Then he carried her down to the gates of hell

He carried her down to the gates of hell
Said rake up the coals and we'll roast her well

I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
And the devil knows who I'll marry

I have stockings of silk
Shoes of bright green leather
Combs to buckle my hair
And a ring for every finger

Feather beds are soft
Painted rooms are bonny
I would trade them all
For my handsome whim some Johnny

Some say he's bad
I say he's bonny
Fairest of them all

Judy Collins,"A fair young maid was in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
He said fair maid, will you marry me?
And this answer was her reply

Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
For I've a love and he sails the sea
And though he's been gone for seven years
Still he will return to me

Well, what if he's in some battle slain
Or if he's been drowned in the deep salt sea
Or if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

If he's in some battle slain
Then I shall die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
Still I'm true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they live across the sea

He picked her up in his arms so strong
And kisses he gave her one two three
Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley

Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley",John Riley
Judy Collins,"[Chorus]
I am a maid of constant sorrow
I've seen trials all of my days
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

Your friends may say that I'm a stranger
My face they'll never see no more
There is but one promise that's given
I'll sail on God's golden shore

All through this world I'm bound to ramble
Through sun and wind and drivin' rain
I'm bound to ride the western railway
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Like a banshee's lonely croon
And a thousand blades were flashin'
At the rising of the moon

All along the singing river
That dark mass of men were seen
Far above their shining weapons
Hung their own immortal green
Death to every foe and traitor
Foreign strike the marchin' tune
And hurrah me boys for Ireland
Tis the rising of the moon

Well, they fought for poor old Ireland
And full bitter was their fate
Oh what glorious pride and sorrow
Fill the name of ninety-eight
Yet thank God while hearts are beating
Foreign manhood's burnin' noon,
We shall follow in their footsteps

For he robs the girls of their delight
Causes them to weep causes them to mourn

And on the world's oceans I will float
Hail each captain as I pass by
There I'll ask for my sailor boy

Oh captain captain tell me true
Does my own Willie sail with you
Tell me soon to give me joy
None will I have but my sailor boy

Oh no kind lady he's not here
He drowned in the gulf and we buried him there
Upon the island as we passed by
There we left your sailor boy

Oh she rung her hands and tore her hair
Just like some lady in great despair
Called for a chair to sit her down
Penningdon for to write it down

Oh dig my grave wide and deep
Put a marble stone at the head and feet
On my grave a turtle dove
Tell the world I died for my love

Judy Collins,"Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the bloody wars
Of high Germany
For they've carried off my own true love
Left a broken heart to bleed

The drums beat in the morning
Before the break of day
And the wee, wee pipes played loud and shrill
While yet the morn was gray

And the bonnie flags were all unfurled
Was a gallant sight to see
But sorrow for my soldier lad
Who marched to Germany

Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the country
Where our men are forced to be
And woe be to the foreign wars
That stole my love from me

The cause of greatest fame am I
The cause of proudest care on high
To have for mine, the king of all

And though You are the king of all
They sent You to the manger stall
Where at Your feet they all shall fall
And glorify my child the king

There shone a star above three kings,
To guide them to the king of kings.
They held You in their humble arms
And knelt before You until dawn.

They gave You myrrh they gave You gold
Frankincense and gifts untold
They traveled far these gifts to bring,
And glorify their newborn king.

The cow's in the corn 
Now is the time for a child to be born 
He'll laugh at the moon 
And cry for the sun 
And if it's a boy he'll carry a gun 
Sang the crow on the cradle 

And if it should be that this baby's a girl 
Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl 
With rings on her fingers 
And bells on her toes 
And a bomber above her wherever she goes

The black and the white 
Somebody's baby is born for a fight 
The crow on the cradle 
The white and the black 
Somebody's baby is not coming back 
Sang the crow on the cradle 

Your mother and father will sweat and they'll slave 
To build you a coffin and dig you a grave 
Hush-a-bye little one, never you weep 
For we've got a toy that can put you to sleep 
Sang the crow on the cradle 

Bring me my gun, and I'll shoot that bird dead

The crow on the cradle, what can we do 
Ah, this is a thing that I'll leave up to you

Saying here am I thy child's father
Although that I am not comely

I am a selchie in the sea

He hath put it upon her knee

And take thee up thy nurse's fee

When the sun shines hot
On every stone
That I shall take my little wee son
And I'll teach him for to swim in the foam
And you will marry a gunner good
And a proud good gunner I'm sure he'll bev And he'll go out on a May morning
And he'll kill both my wee son and me

And goes off in the air with the dew on her breast
Like a jolly plough boy she whistles and she sings
And comes home in the evening with the dew on her wings

He goes whistlin' and singin' through yonder long shade
He met with dark-eyed Susan she's handsome I declare
And he bought her rows of ribbon for to roll around her hair

He met with dark eyed Susan she's handsome I declare

Taught him to whistle to sing and dance and run

Round the world in half a day on him I could ride
Sing terry O' day

I buyed me a little bull he was four inches high
Everybody feared him who ever heard him cry
When he began to bellow he made such melodious sound
That all the walls in London came tumblin' to the ground

I buyed me a flock of sheep thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool sometimes yielded feathers
I know mine are the very best sheep for yield and increase
Every full and turn of the moon they bring forth lambs and geese
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little glass colored it was green
In it was all the wonders man has ever seen
I put in my pocket tied up with a cloth
Cried and cried the day I found that it had been lost

Many a cold and winter night that I alone have been.
It is a cold and cruel night when I must lie alone,

To go and get me married to one who is so young.
For he is only sixteen years and I am twenty-one.

Oh! daughter, dear daughter, I did not do you wrong
For I have married you to a rich man's son
And he shall be a match for thee when I am dead and gone.
He is young, but he is daily growing.

Oh! father, dear father, I'll tell you what I'll do;
I'll send the boy to college for another year or two;
And all around his college cap, I'll bind a ribbon blue,
For to let the ladies know that he's married.

A year it went by and I passed the college wall
And saw the young collegians a-playing at the ball;
Amidst them was my own true love, the fairest of them all,
He was young but he was daily growing.

At the age of sixteen he was a married man,
And at the age of seventeen he was the father of a son,
At the age of eighteen, his grave had all grown green;
And the death put an end to his growing.

I'll make my love a shroud of ornamental brown;
And whilst I am a making it, the tears they will run down;
For once I had my own love, now he's lying low,
And I'll nurse his bonny boy while he's growing.",Bonnie Boy Is Young

Judy Collins,"Oh, can't you see that pretty little bird
Singing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black as coal

Of all the colors I ever did see
Red and black are the ones I dread
For when a man spills blood on the coal
They carry him down from the coal mines dead

Fly away you red winged bird
Leave behind the miner's wife
She'll dream about you when you're gone
She'll dream about you all her life

Oh, can't you see that pretty little bird
Singing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black as coal

Judy Collins,"As I was a walking and a rambling one day, 
I met a fair couple a making their way. 
And one was a cowboy, and a brave one was he.
And the other was a lady and a fair one was she.
The other was a lady and a fair one was she.

""Oh where are you going my pretty, fair maid?""
""Just down by the River, just down by the shade,
Just down by the River, just down by the spring
To see the Water gliding and the nightingale sing.
To see the Water gliding hear the nightingale sing.""

They had not been there but an hour or so
When out of his satchel came fiddle and bow
He played a tune that made the woods ring
She said I can't hear the nightingale sing
She said I can't hear the nightingale sing

He said pretty lady it's time to give o'er
O' no pretty cowboy just play one tune more
I'd rather hear the fiddle or the touch of one string
Than to see the water gliding or the nightingale sing
Than to see the water gliding hear the nightingale sing

She said pretty cowboy will you marry me
O no pretty lady that never can be
I've a wife in Arizona and a lady is she
One wife and a cow ranch is aplenty for me
One wife and a cow ranch is aplenty for me

Well I'm going out to Mexico I'll stay Ã¢??bout a year
I'll drink red wine, I'll drink lots of beer
If I ever return it will be in the spring
To see the water gliding and the nightingales sing
To see the water gliding hear the nightingale sing.",Wild Rippling Water
Judy Collins,"In the heat of the summer
When the pavements were burning
The soul of a city was ravaged in the night
After the city sun was sinkin'

Now no one knows how it started
Why the windows were shattered
But deep in the dark, someone set the spark
And then it no longer mattered.

Down the streets they were rumbling
All the tempers were ragin'
Oh, where, oh, where are the white silver tongues
Who forgot to listen to the warnings?

On and On come the angry 
No longer following reason
And all the stores were the target now
Where just the other day they were buyin'

Drunk with the memory of the ghetto
Drunk with the lure of the looting
And the memory of the uniforms shoving with their sticks
Asking, "";Are you looking for trouble?"";

""No, no, no,"" moaned the mayor.
""It's not the way of the order.
""Oh stay in your homes, please leave us alone
""We'll be glad to talk in the morning.""

""For shame, for shame,"" wrote the papers.
""Why the hurry to your hunger?
""Now the rubble's resting on your broken streets
""So you see what your rage has unraveled.""

Baricades sadly were risin'
Bricks were heavily flyin'
And the loudspeaker drowned like a whisperin' sound
When compared to the angered emotions 

And when the fury was over
And the Shame was replacing the anger.
So wrong, so wrong, but we've been down so long
And we had to make somebody listen

Judy Collins,"I am a queen's daughter
I come from Capakin
In search of Lord Gregory
Pray God I find him

The rain beats on my yellow head
The dew wets my skin
My wee babe's cold in my arms
Lord Gregory, let me in

Lord Gregory, he is not here
I swear can't be seen
He's gone to bonny Scotland
For to bring home a fair queen

So leave now these portals
And likewise this hall
For it's deep in the sea
You should find you downfall

Oh don't you remember, love
That night in Capakin
When we exchanged rings, love
And I against my will

Yours was pure silver
And mine was but tin
Yours cost a guinea
And mine but a pin

My curse on you, mother
My curse being sore
I dreamed that my true love
Come a knocking at the door

Lie down now, my foolish son
Lie down and sleep
Twas only a servant girl
Lies drowned in the deep

Go saddle my black horse
The brown or the bay
Go saddle the fastest horse
In my stable this day

I'll ride over mountains
And valleys so wide
I'll find the girl that I love
And ride by her side",Lord Gregory
Judy Collins,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots
Judy Collins,"Why all these bugles crying for squads of young men drilled
To kill and to be killed and waiting by this train?
Why the orders loud and hoarse, why the engine's groaning cough
As it strains to drag us off into the holocaust?
Why crowds who sing and cry, and shout and fling us flowers
And trade their right for ours to murder and to die?

The dove has torn her wings so no more songs of love
We are not here to sing, we're here to kill the dove

Why has this moment come when childhood has to die
When hope shrinks to a sigh and speech into a drum?
Why are they pale and still, young boys trained overnight
Conscripts forced to fight and dressed in gray to kill?
These rain clouds massing tight, this train load battle bound
This moving burial ground sent thundering toward the night

Why statues towering brave above the last defeat
Old word and lies repeat across the new made grave?
Why the same still birth that victory always brought
These hoards of glory bought by men with mouths of earth?
Dead ash without a spark where cities glittered bright
For guns probe every light and crush it in the dark

And why your face undone with jagged lines of tears
That gave in those first years all peace I ever won?
Your body in the gloom, the platform fading back
Your shadow on the track, a flower on a tomb
And why these days ahead when I must let you cry
And live prepared to die as if our love were dead?

",La Colombe
Judy Collins,"Got up sometime in the afternoon
And you didn't feel like much
You said to yourself, ""Where are you, golden boy
Where is your famous golden touch?""

I thought you knew where
All the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince
Of all the wheels in Ivory town

Look at your body now
Where there's nothing much to say
And a bitter voice in the mirror says
""Hey prince, you need a shave""

Now if you can manage to get
Your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping
A stainless steel razor blade?

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

There's no hot water
And the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect
From the kind of places you've been living in?

Don't drink from that cup
It's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend
That is your vision that is dim

Cover up your face with soap, there
Now, you're Santa Claus
And you've got an A for anyone
Who will give you his applause

I thought you were a racing man
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror
And it's stopping at your face

That's right, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
And wasn't it a strange way down?

Once there was a path
And a girl with chestnut hair
And you spent the summers
Picking all the berries that grew there

There were times she was a woman
There were times she was a child
As you held her in the shadows
Where the raspberries grow wild

And you climbed the highest mountains
And you sang about the view
And everywhere you went
Love went along with you

That's a hard one to remember
It makes you clench your fist
And the veins stand out like highways
All along your wrist

And yes, it's come to this
It's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
Wasn't it a strange way down?

You can still find a job
Go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine
There are coupons you can send

Why don't you join the Rosicrucians?
They will give you back your hope
You can find your love in diagrams
In a plain, brown envelope

But you've used up all your coupons
Except the one that seems
To be tattooed on your arm
Along with several thousand dreams

Now Santa Claus comes forward
That's a razor in his mitt
And he puts on his dark glasses
And he shows you where to hit

And then the cameras pan
The stand in stuntman's
Dress rehearsal rag

Judy Collins,"Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength and lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll may be trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water
And He spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see Him
He said, ""All men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you trust  her
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind",Suzanne
Judy Collins,"The lady comes to the gate dressed in lavender and leather
Looking North to the sea she finds the weather fine
She hears the steeple bells ringing through the orchard
All the way from town
She watches seagulls fly
Silver on the ocean stitching through the waves
The edges of the sky

Many people wander up the hills
From all around you
Making up your memories and thinking they have found you
They cover you with veils of wonder as if you were a bride
Young men holding violets are curious to know if you have cried
And tell you why
And ask you why
Any way you answer

Lace around the collars of the blouses of the ladies
Flowers from a Spanish friend of the family
The embroid'ry of your life holds you in
And keeps you out but you survive
Imprisoned in your bones
Behind the isinglass windows of your eyes

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone

Even now by the gate with you long hair blowing
And the colors of the day that lie along your arms
You must barter your life to make sure you are living
And the crowd that has come
You give them the colors
And the bells and wind and the dream

Will there never be a prince who rides along the sea and the mountains
Scattering the sand and foam into amethyst fountains
Riding up the hills from the beach in the long summer grass
Holding the sun in his hands and shattering the isinglass?

Day and night and day again and people come and go away forever
While the shining summer sea dances in the glass of your mirror
While you search the waves for love and your visions for a sign
The knot of tears around your throat is crystallizing into your design

And in the night the iron wheels rolling through the rain
Down the hills through the long grass to the sea
And in the dark the hard bells ringing with pain
Come away alone
Come away alone with me.",Albatross
Judy Collins,"Bien sûr, nous eûmes des orages
Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient

Dans cette chambre sans berceau
Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

Mais mon amour
Mon doux mon tendre mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore tu sais je t'aime

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements
Tu m'as gardé de pièges en pièges
Je t'ai perdue de temps en temps
Bien sûr tu pris quelques amants

Il fallait bien passer le temps
Il faut bien que le corps exulte
Finalement finalement
Il nous fallut bien du talent
Pour être vieux sans être adultes

Oh, mon amour
Mon doux mon tendre mon merveilleux amour
De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore, tu sais, je t'aime

Et plus le temps nous fait cortège
Et plus le temps nous fait tourment
Mais n'est-ce pas le pire piège
Que vivre en paix pour des amants
Bien sûr tu pleures un peu moins tôt

Je me déchire un peu plus tard
Nous protégeons moins nos mystères
On laisse moins faire le hasard
On se méfie du fil de l'eau
Mais c'est toujours la tendre guerre

De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour
Je t'aime encore tu sais je t'aime

Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you

Now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes like the shoreline and the sea

But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie

When I am Lord at last
And your body is the little highway shrine
That all my priests have passed
That all my priests have passed?

My priests, they will put flowers there
They will kneel before the glass
But they'll wear away your little window, love
They will trample on the grass
They will trample on the grass

And who will shoot the arrow
That men will follow through your grace
When I am Lord of memories
And all your armor has turned to lace
And all your armor has turned to lace?

The simple life of heroes
The twisted life of saints
They just confuse the sunny calendar
With their red and golden paint
With their red and golden paint

And all of you have seen the dance
That God has kept from me
But he has seen me watching you
When all your minds were free
When all your minds were free

And who will write love songs for you
When I am Lord at last
And your body is the little highway shrine

I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now

And you turned into a grownup male stranger

I'd just have to fall

Making love to people
That I didn't even like to see

Yes, I mean in the sick sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
Try to hold your face before me

And I want you to know, I just had to go

I wouldn't be here at all

I never slept with you

You have gathered flowers, and did they not smell for me?

And I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds blow
Well, the liquor tasted good and the time went fast
Well, there she goes my friend, there she's rolling now at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

Judy Collins,"No use cryin', talking to a stranger
Namin' the sorrow you've seen
Too many sad times, too many bad times
Nobody knows what you mean

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use ramblin', walkin' in the shadows
Trailin' a wanderin' star
No one beside you, no one to hide you
Nobody knows where you are

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use gamblin' runnin' in the darkness
Looking for spirit that's free
Too many wrong times, too many long times
Nobody knows what you see

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roamin', lying by the roadside
Seekin' a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walkin' behind

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

",Pack Up Your Sorrows
Judy Collins,"Out under the winter sky
Out under the winter sky
Stars come trembling on my eye
Stars to tremble my eye

And I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
Hand me wings for to fly

High is heaven in early morn
High is heaven in early morn
Men lie sleeping in beds that are warm
Sleep in beds that are warm

And I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
Tells my soul not to moan

Judy Collins,"Amazing grace 
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost 
But now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught 
My heart to fear
And grace my Fears relieved
How precious did
That grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace hath brought 
Us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

When we've been there 
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We'll have no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Judy Collins,"Farewell to Tarwathie
Adieu Mormond Hill
And the dear land of Crimmond
I bid you farewell
I'm bound off for Greenland
And ready to sail
In hopes to find riches
In hunting the whale

Farewell to my comrades
For a while we must part
And likewise the dear lass
Who first won my heart
The cold coast of Greenland
My love will not chill
And the longer my absence
More loving she'll feel

Our ship is well rigged
And she's ready to sail
The crew they are anxious
To follow the whale
Where the icebergs do float
And the stormy winds blow
Where the land and the ocean
Is covered with snow

The cold coast of Greenland
Is barren and bare
No see time nor harvest
Is ever known there
And the birds here sing sweetly
In mountain and dale
But there's no bird in Greenland
To sing to the whale

There is no habitation 
For a man to live there
And the king of that country
Is the fierce Greenland bear
And there'll be no temptation
To tarry long there
With our ship under full
We will homeward repair

Judy Collins,"Jacob's heart bent with fear,
Like a bow with death for its arrow,
In Vain he search for the final truth
To set his soul free of doubt.

Over the mountains he walked,
With his head bent searching for reasons,
Then he called out to God
For help and climbed to the top of a hill.

Wind swept the sunlight through the wheat fields,
In the orchard the nightingale sang,
While the plums that she broke with her brown beak,
Tomorrow would turn in to songs.

Then she flew up through the rain
With the sun silver bright on her feathers,
Jacob put back his frowns and sighed and walked 
Back down the hill.

God doesn't answer me and 
He never will.",Nightingale II

Of women giving birth
And in it I would weave the innocence
Of the children of all the earth
Children of all the earth

Won't you show my brothers and sisters

'Cause I I would bind up this sorry world
With hand and my heart and mind

Judy Collins,"Come, all of you who are not satisfied
As rulers in a lone wallpapered room
Full of mute birds and flowers that falsely bloom
And closets choked with dreams that long ago died

Come, let us sweep the old streets like a bride
Sweep out the dead leaves with a relentless broom
Prepare for spring as if he were our groom
For whose light footstep eagerly we bide

We'll sweep out the shadows, where the rats long fed
Sweep out our shame and in its place we'll make
A bower for love, a splendid marriage bed
Fragrant with flowers a quiver for the spring

And when he comes, our murdered dreams shall wake
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing
And when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing

",Prothalamium
Judy Collins,"'Tis the gift to be simple
'Tis the gift to be free
'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
It will be in the valley of love and delight

When true simplicity is gained
To bow and to bend, we will not be ashamed
To turn, turn, will be our delight
'Til by turning, turning, we come round right

Judy Collins,"Sons of the thief, sons of the saint

All were children like yourown

But sons of tycoons or sons of the farm
All of their children run from your arms
Through fields of gold through fields of ruin

In towering waves in walls of flesh
Among dying birds trembling with death

Judy Collins,"There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain
All these places have their meanings
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Is all my time together;
Take the rugged sunny days,
The warm and rocky weather,
Take the roads that I have walked along,
Looking for tomorrow's time,
Peace of mind.

As my life spills into yours,
Changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time,
Turning time to flowers,
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before.

We have seen a million stone lying by the water,
You have climbed the hills with me 
To the mountain shelter.
Taken off the days, one by one,
Setting them to breathe in the sun.

Take the lilies and the lace
From the days of childhood,
All the willow winding paths
Leading up and outward.
This is what I give
This is what I ask you for;
Nothing more",Since You Asked
Judy Collins,"The door it opened slowly
And my father he came in
I was nine years old

And he stood so far above me
And his blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold

He said, ""I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told""

So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his axe was made of gold

You who build these altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore

For you never had a vision
And you never have been tempted
By the Devil or the Lord

Yes, you who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before

When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word

And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I ask
""According to whose plan?""

When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will love you if I can

And may I never learn to scorn
The body out of chaos born
The woman and the man

And mercy on our uniform
Man of peace, man of war
The peacock spreads his fan

All the bird are leaving,
Ah, how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire,
We'll still be dreaming.
I do not count the time

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shore,
Your fickle friends are leaving,
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go,
But I will still be here,
I have no thought of leaving.

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I'm not alone,
While my love is near me,
And I know,it will be so,till it's time to go,
So come the storms of winter,
And then the birds in spring again.
I do not fear the time

Who knows how my love grows?

Judy Collins,"I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
The traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
Rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
Pigeons fly, and papers lie
Waiting to blow away

I woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of orange juice too
And the light poured in like butterscotch
Stuck to all my senses

Oh, won't you stay we'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the contain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By jewel light, by candlelight, if only you will stay
Oh my darling won't you wake up, it is a Chelsea morning

Do you know, my darling
Will there ever be a time

I thought you'd like to know
The willow's turning green
I was down along the railroad tracks today
The winter seems so long
I was here and you were gone
It seems that was as long as I remember

Tell me how you spend your time there
Here there's nothing much to do

And the trains are going somewhere
But they won't be stopping here to bring you home

Think Ill go out to Alberta
Weathers good there in the fall
Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies

Judy Collins,"One morning in Bolivia
The leader of the partisans and two of his companions
Were forced to flee the mountains for their lives
Through green and dusty villages they sped along the little roads
The peasants smiled and shouted as they hurried by
Jesus called out to every one ""Don't think that we are leaving,
They only tried to frighten us with guns, we shall return,""
Continue with your work, continue with your talk
You have it in your hand to own your life to own your land
The people smiled and shouted and they ran along a little while
The stood and watched, their hands were restless and empty
The body of Jesus was in the jeep that they blew up 
Before it reach the plane

The priest was proud to bless him for what there was 
of him remaining in the afternoon

Continue with your work, continue with your talk
You have it in your hands to own your life to own your land
There is no one who can show you the road you should be on
They only tell you they can show you and then tomorrow they are gone

The smell of oil and incense fill the room in this adobe hut
Where on the table lies the body of a man
His face is pale and young, his beard is dark and curled
Pennies hold his eyelids from the evening light
People from the village those who knew him, those who killed him
Stand inside the door, their hands are restless and empty
They watch the priest make silent crosses in the air
And pray to God inside their hearts for their own souls

Continue with your work, continue with your talk
You have it in your hands to own your life to own your land
There is no one who can show you the road you should be on
They only tell you they can show you and then tomorrow they are gone",Che

In the sand beside the sea
The sunrise hits their oilskin boots
And their painted boats and me

For the tide to turn

Never catches more than he knows 
He can sell in a day,

Night's the time to go dancing

They're drinking beer and laughing
And squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them
When the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered
From all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait
They always know that the tide will turn

The big ships hunt for whales
The Japanese have caught so many
That now they hunt for snails

He seems content to live
With the sun and the sand
And a net full of fish when the tide turns

Judy Collins,"She is a weaver
Through her hands the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars

She sings and sighs as the shuttle flies
Through the yarn like a Kerry dancer
Pink and purple velvet red for a lover's bed

Living north of San Francisco
With a man who built his house alone
Living peaceful in the country
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

She is a spinner
In her hands the wooden wheel turns the wool around
Then around again

A gypsy from Bolinas
Sits and plays the mandolin
Faces smile in the firelight of a foggy night

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says, it's peaceful where she is living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

You can see the bridges of the city
Hanging in the air by steel and stone
She says, it's peaceful where she's living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

Through her hand the bright thread travels

Her hands are light, her hair is bright as the summer sun

A plain wooden cottage
A patch of brown lawn

He moved to Arizona in nineteen sixty-one

I always knew the paths we walked were meant to cross again
We talked on the telephone once or twice a year
His voice was so familiar, his memory was clear

I'll never know what brought him to where he finally stood
A shotgun pointed at his head in a cabin in the woods
But somehow I could hear it, it struck my heart as well

Judy Collins,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans

Say a prayer for his wife and his children

Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay at home voter

See the parading of gray suited grafters

Judy Collins,"I didn't even know the man
I didn't know the man himself
Even though his music filled my life
As it has so many others

I knew that he had died that week
After fighting death a year or more
But I had had a rule before
That funerals were a waste of flowers

But something said I had to go
To be a witness to his gift of love
A man who never once gave up on life
Until death took him in his tracks

The people stood around the church
Ten thousand people there they say, or more
Black and white, rich and poor
Together they were there to say farewell

In New York City it had rained that day
The streets were silver and the sky was gray
But in the church the music soared and sang
And seemed to fill the air with shining sun

The man was a hero
He played the music of our souls
He knew that we all have in us
A place where beauty always grows

Outside in the streets again
The people wandered through the falling rain
They waved their hands and dried their tears
And turned to go about their lives again

But none of us will be the same
If we hear the things his music says
That loving is the gift of life
And making music was his way of love 

The man was a hero
He played the music of our souls
He knew that we all have in us
A place where beauty always grows",Song for Duke
Judy Collins,"Here I am at your door
hoping you'll come back once more
And here I am and your love has died
It's one thing I wish you could hide

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you

I've heard it said that time brings relief
But hey just how long will it take
And here I am I feel like a fool
For causing this fool's heart to break

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you

How can I see you like seeing a friend 
when each time I see you I break down again

Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you
Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
but crty all the tears left inside you
",Love Hurts
Judy Collins,"It seems I've always been in charge before
I made the rules and they were followed
The men I loved would gather at my door
To wait the word for the day

I must admit I had my moments
When I wished the world would suddenly go mad
But then I'd come back to my senses
And think how sweet was that freedom I thought I had

Out of control you send me
I never know where it will end for me
You put the lights in my head, a song in my bed

Oh, nothing I say can change you
You know your way, life is clear to you
All I can do when you call me is follow
Oh, I am a woman as sensible as can be

Out of control, you spin me
Take me again, your love is winning me
I'd follow you anywhere you say
I fell in love with you today

",Out of Control
Judy Collins,"The Diamond is a ship my boys, for Greenland she is bound
And the quay it is all garnished with bonny lassies 'round
The Captain gives the order to sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets my lads no darkness dims the tide

[Chorus]
So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the Bonnie Ship the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead, the lassies stand around
With their shawls about their heads and salt tears runnin' down
I'll never weep my bonny lad though I'm left behind
For there's not a rose on Greenland's ice to make you change your mind

[Chorus]

Here's a health to the Resolution likewise the Eliza Swan
A health to the Battler of Montrose and the Diamond ship of fame
They wear the trousers of the white the jackets of the blue
When they return to Peterhead they'll find that we've been true

[Chorus]

It'll be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home
With a ship that's full of oil my lads and money to their name
They'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear
And every lass in Peterhead sing hush-a-bye my dear

Judy Collins,"Travelin' down that coaltown road,
Listen to those rubber tires whine;
Goodbye to Buckeye and White Sycamore
I'm leavin' you behind.
I've been a coal man all my life 
Layin' down track in the hole,
Got a back like an ironwood bent by the wind 
Blood veins blue as the coal. 

Somebody said ""That's a strange tattoo 
You have on the side of your head.""
I said ""That's a blue print, left by the coal 
Just a little more and I'd be dead""
And I love the rumble and I love the dark 
I love the cool of the slate.
But it's on down the new road lookin' for a job 
It's the travelin' and lookin' I hate. 

I've stood for the union, walkin' the line,
Fought against the company;
Stood for the U. M. W. of A.
Now who's gonna stand for me?
I got no house and I got no pay,
Just got a worried soul;
And this blue tattoo on the side of my head 
Left by the number nine coal. 

Someday when I'm dead and gone 
To Heaven, the land of my dreams,
I won't have to worry on losin' my job 
To bad times 'n big machines.
I ain't gonna pay my money away 
For pensions and hospital plans.
I'm gonna pick coal where the blue heavens roll 
And sing with the angel bands.",Coal Tattoo
Judy Collins,"I went out to the hazelwood
Because a fire was in my head
Cut and peeled a hazel wand
And hooked a berry to a thread

And when white moths were on the wing
And moth-like stars were flickering out
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout

When I had laid it on the ground
And gone to blow the fire aflame
Something rustled on the floor
And someone called me by my name

It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And vanished in the brightening air

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands
I will find out where she has gone
And see her lips and take her hand

And walk through long green dappled grass
And pluck till time and times are done
The silver apples of the moon
The golden apples of the sun",Golden Apples of the Sun
Judy Collins,"You have many houses, one for every season
Mountains in your windows, violets in your hands
Through your English meadows your blue-eyed horses wander
You're in Colorado for the Spring

When the Winter finds you, you fly to where it's summer
Rooms that face the ocean, moonlight on your bed
Mermaids swift as dolphins paint the air with diamonds
You are like a seagull as you said

Why do you fly bright feathered sometimes in my dreams?
The shadows of your wings fall over my face
I can feel no air, I can find no peace
Brides in black ribbons, witches in white
Fly in through windows, fly out through the night

Why do I think I'm dying sometimes in my dreams
I see myself a child running through the trees
Searching for myself, looking for my life
Looking everywhere crawling on my knees
I cannot see the leaves, I cannot see the light

Then I see you walking just beyond the forest
Walking very quickly, walking by yourself
Your shoes are silver, your coat is made of velvet
Your eyes are shining, your voice is sweet and clear
""Come on"" you say ""come with me, I'm going to the castle""

All the bells are ringing, the weddings have begun
But I can only stand here-I cannot move to follow
I'm burning in the shadows and freezing in the sun

There are people with you living in your houses
People from your childhood who remember how you were
You were always flying, nightingale of sorry
Singing bird with rainbows on your wings",Houses
Judy Collins,"Down in some lone valley in a lonesome place
Where the wild birds all whistle and their notes do increase
Farewell Pretty Saro I must bid you adieu
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go

My love she won't have me and I understand
She wants a rich merchant and I have no land
I cannot maintain her, I've no silver and gold
Can't give her the nice things that a big house will hold

But if I were a merchant and I could write a fine hand
And I'd write my love a letter that she'd understand
I'd write it by the river where the waters o'erflow
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go",Pretty Saro
Judy Collins,"Seems it was just a while ago
All of my friends and I
Went to each others weddings
And stood by each others side
And became brides

Talked to Kurt on the phone today
He said that he and Liz were through
And by the way that
Things have been going
You could that they were overdue

For every other married pair of us
That already split in two
Each of us turning our own lives alone
For sleeping with someone new

Everyone wants to be free

And don't you know it is my lifetime

I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before

Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

Teach me how to sing

If I cannot fly
Let me sing

Sipping coffee, dancing
Pretty women are a wonder

Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air

Stay within' you, glancing
Stay forever, breathing lightly

Blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
Even when they leave, they still are there

Pretty women in their gardens
How they make a man sing
Proof of heaven as you're living

And what's on the other side

Gonna go and get me some sunshine.
Clipping along t'ward the Colorado Rockies,
Leaving you behind me.

There's a cold icy wind blowing like a demon 
Off Lake Michigan.
I'm going where the weather is warm and the heat off.

You burned me out and you did me in,
You beat me at the game 
I can not win.

I'm going where the pace is slower,
The stakes are lower.
I'm running for my life.

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you.
I'll curl my hair, and listen to my heart.
I don't want to hear a word about you, 
I'll do what I care to do,
I'll do what I dare to do.
I'm running for my life.

I can see the switch man out in the freight yard,
Waving his lights at my train.
Red fir stopping my heart from beating,
Green for driving me insane.
And the rain is pouring,
And the wheels are rolling past that Nevada line
I'm going where the weather is hot,
And you are not.

I played the fool I believed your lies,
I danced till I was nearly paralyzed
I'm gone and going.
I'm running for my life

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you,
I'll get a room with windows on the sea
I'll do all the things I could never do,
You never will find me here
Not a thing to remind me here.

Sky's getting bright with California sunrise,
Shining its light on my train
Drying my tears soothing my fears,
Taking away my old pain.
And the engine's rockin' and the wheels are talkin'
About the tracks ahead,
I'm going where the world is new and the past is dead.

I'm leaving you with my bridges burning,
There's no returning.

You've made a garden out of love
With splendid flowers and bowered paths

A sorrow Allison could hide
That Denver soothed and comforted

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

When the world just went away,
I didn't know if it was night or day.
I didn't know if there were clouds or fire in the sky,
I didn't want to live if I could die.
Somewhere down the line I found myself up on that road,
Where the devil led me, I would go.
I had sold my soul for pleasure, 
Thinkin' it would last,
All my hopes had vanished in the past.

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,
Driftin' away with the tide.
God only knows how I made it back home.
I must have an angel on my side. 

In the mornin' I'd wake up and shake my weary head,
Wonder where I'd been and what I'd said.
Was I on the River Styx for all eternity?
Would I drown forever in the sea?
Why did anyone keep livin', what was there to find?
I wanted just a little peace of mind. 

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,
Driftin' away with the tide.
God only knows how I made it back home.
I must have an angel on my side. 

Never had a flash of lightnin' comin' right at me,
One day I just know I woke up free.
The day was breakin', I was livin', 
I couldn't tell you why,
First I laughed and then I learned to cry.
Somethin' in my heart was sayin' you can reach the sky,
You just gotta live until you die.

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,

Nightmares come, I know, I've had one
Why can't I be awake? Say it's just a dream
This is all too real for dreaming
Like something in a play, truer then it seems

How did your face of love turn to hate?
Only a moment passed, now it is too late
Blind to the truth I have loved
Lost for now, I am helpless without you

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love

Clouds covering her face so she can not see
Tears are falling from my own eyes
Hope dying in my heart, struggles to be free

Where I thought that I'd found love at last
Love that would suffer my sins
Love that would let me begin to live

Doin' ninety-five in the middle of the night on an open road,
Time for a good ol' girl like me to be bedded down.
Gotta get home before the kids find out I've been away,
I figure I'm gonna reach town just before dawn.

I can see the sun is gonna be comin' up real soon,
Hope the children don't wake up and wonder where I am!
Gotta get the older ones to school and play with the baby,
She's the apple of her mother's eye, and doesn't she know it!

Don't know how it happened one more time, 
The money's running' out and the other kids are cryin!
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy,
Doin' what I can to raise my babies.

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels, 
Love never knows a season.
Mama, tell me you understand,
The heart always has a reason.

Wonder if you know just how it feels to be alone,
Tryin' to raise a bunch of kids on nothin' but love and guts.
When the day is over I'm about as wrecked as a body can be,
I got my troubles, but again I need me some kind of lovin',

Don't know how it happened one more time,
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'.
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy,
Doin' what I can to raise my babies.

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels,
Love never knows a season.
Mama, tell me you understand,
The heart always has a reason.

The doctor down in Lincoln said I'd be all right,
He said he didn't want to help me but he'd do it just this once.
Made me feel so bad I couldn't stop the tears from fallin',
Made me wish he had to pay this kind of price for his lovin'.

Don't know how it happened one more time,
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'.
Five kids are gonna drive me crazy,
Lord, I can't have another baby.

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels,
Love never knows a season.
Mama, tell me you understand,
The heart always has a reason.",Mama Mama
Judy Collins,"Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan 

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again 

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning 

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning 

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is 

Look
A new day has begun",Memory

Even though it may tear her apart
I can hear the lullabies I sang you

One word from you can melt the winter snow
Make me forget the longest mile

I know I stumbled on the way

When I was wrong you had to pay

I hope by now you can forgive me
And take the good I had to give
I was too young to be your teacher
We learned together how to live

If you're a dream, don't let me wake

Walking fast in little towns
I had a lot of men offer me love

Never felt so much at home

I knew somewhere there were dreams coming true
Finally one of them is mine
If you're a dream, please let me believe
That life could be so fine

Let's hurry up don't waste the day
Out in the park we'll stage a fight
Just like on the T.V.
You play the one who has to die
I'll shoot the gun and you will cry 
You will fall down and I will run
Just like on the T.V.
My daddy has a gun for real
I'm gonna have my own someday

My daddy told me what to do
If anybody bothers you
He says the law is on our side

Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
And ask your questions later

My older brother has his own 
It's got a handle made of bone
He carries it all over town

My daddy gave my mama one
Genuine real pearl-handled gun
She says she got to have her one
Just like on the T.V.
Did you see who got shot last night?
I stayed up to watch him
They rushed him off to surgery
Right there on the T.V.
Gosh I hope they catch the guy
I think they ought to shoot him
But if they bring him back alive
He'll be on the T.V.

And ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first

I've got to go it's getting late
I wish I had a real gun
Then I would never be afraid
Like some guys on T.V.
I'd never use my gun on you
You'd never have to worry
You'd be the good guy on my side
Just like on the T.V.

I think when I grow up someday 
I'm gonna join the NRA 
I saw them telling what they're for
Last night on the T.V.
My daddy says it's not a game
We've got to play to win it
He says I'll have to learn to fight 
Just like on the T.V.

Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
And ask your questions later

Judy Collins,"Everybody loves to love
The local girl made good
Surely I'd find peace of mind
If anybody could

Still at times I find myself
Wishing they were right
If everybody loves me
Where are they tonight?

Everybody loves to love
The sweetheart on parade
Out there on the stage tonight
The girl who's got it made

But after the applause is gone
I sometimes wish I knew
Why everybody loves me
And I love only you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give?
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live?
All I need is someone I can share it with

But how they love to love
The golden girl next door
Up there with her name in lights
Now who could ask for more?

Still I can't help wondering
Why it should be true
That everybody loves me
Everyone but you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give?
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live?

Judy Collins,"My child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away. 
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My child turned ten the other day.
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today,
I've got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's ok.""
He turned away, but his smile never dimmed,
""I'm gonna be like him,"" he said.
Yes, I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon. 
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
""I'm proud of you, son. Will you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
""What I'd really like to do is borrow the car keys.
I'll see you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, I've long since retired and my child moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.""
He said, ""My new job's a hassle, and the kids got the flu,
But it's so nice talking to you, dad.
It's so nice talking to you.""

And as I hung up the phone, 
It occurred to me,
My boy's a lot like me.
My boy's a lot like me.

When the world leaves you shivering
And the blizzard blows,
When the snow flies and the night falls
There's a light in the window and a place called home
At the end of the storm. 

One night on the mountain I was headed for Estes
When the roads turned to ice and it started to snow,
Put on the chains in a whirl of white powder,
Half way up to Berthoud near a diner I know

And the light burned inside, shining down through the snowfall
God it was cold and the temperature droppin',
Went in for coffee and shivered as I drank it,
Warm in my hands in the steam as it rose.

Sitting there at the counter was a dark headed stranger,
Me and the owner and him keepin warm,
Nodded hello and I said it's a cold one
Looks like there might be a blizzard tonight -

And ""yes"", said the owner,""
There's a big storm on the mountain,
Good thing we're open, we could be here for hours
There's nothing for miles and it's too late to get to Denver,
Better not try for the summit tonight"".

And the snow fell 
And the night passed
And I talked to the strangers 
While the blizzard blew.

Me and the stranger, you know I don't talk to strangers,
I'm a private sort of person but a blizzard is a blizzard,
And somehow I found myself saying you'd left me,
Tellin' him everything I wanted to say to you.

You know how it is when you can talk to a stranger,
Someone your quite sure you'll never see again -
Soon we were laughin', and talkin', and drinkin'
He said ""you must know you're too good for him"". 

And the snow fell 
And the night passed
And I talked to the stranger 
While the blizzard blew.

The stranger said ""Love it can cry you a river -
Me, I'm a loner cause I can't take the heartache
And sometimes I'm a fighter when I get too much whiskey -
Here have a little whiskey, pretend you don't give a damn -

My cabin's up here on the side of the mountain
You can go up there and sleep through the blizzard"".
I put on my parka, said goodbye to the owner
Followed the stranger through the snow up the mountainside. 

Woke in the morning to the sun on the snow,
My car was buried in six feet of snow drifts,
They dug me out, just the owner and the stranger,
Sent me on my way when the snowplow had been by 

And the roads were all clear and the sun on the mountains
Sparkled like diamonds on the peak to peak highway -
Then I knew that I would get over you, knew you could leave me 
But you'd never break me.

Sand slides through the stranger's hand
As he deals the game.
All the candles are burning low
No more cradles and no more snow

Play your queen, you could win your soul,
Stakes are high you can live or die
To risk everything.

In your goblet the wine is black
As a moonless night
Wet your lips before you kiss
The blazing light
Bets are off but the game is on,
Drop the armor you counted on
All your armies are fled and gone
Win your king, you can play your pawn
Take your time, you have just begun
To risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Through the window you see the storm
That is gathering,
Painted gypsies on dappled horses are galloping
Through the trees in the howling wind
Down the hills to the river bend
Shadow ghosts that are blind as night
Shrieking curses against the night,
Daring you to come join their flight
And risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

There is nothing to hold you now

Birds of prey when the dreamer dies

Burning saints in the flaming skies
Bet your life every promise dies
All that's left for you to try
Is risking everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Oooo, Oooo

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive.
To risk everything.

Time slips by in the hourglass
You can hear your name
Sand slides through the stranger's hand
As he deals the game.
All the candles are burning low
No more cradles and no more snow
Bet your life on a lucky roll
Play your queen, you could win your soul,
Stakes are high you can live or die
To risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.",Queen of the Night
Judy Collins,"Anastasia woman in the cold of the desert night
The fire in the cave is burning hard and bright
Three days her lover hunted on the plains
She never knew if he would ever come home again

So she could feed the flame of love and then
Hold him in her arms again
Make the demons all depart
Heal the wounds that break the heart

A love that lasts is hard to find
Like the harmony in an old design
But the love of a good woman
The love a good woman 
Stands the test of time

Woman on a cliff at the break of a winters day
A baby at her breast and her lover far away
Watches the horizon for the curving sails to rise
Across the water and through the stormy skies

He returns at last from the battle field
Where death has marched with a Christian shield
She will make the demons all depart
Heal the wounds that break the heart

A love that lasts is hard to find
Like the harmony in an old design
But the love of a good woman
The love a good woman 
Stands the test of time

The brittle will be broken
And the supple will survive
Men are born to fight in armor
Women born to stay alive
Behind every veil of tears
There is a sister of a thousand years

High in a canyon where the city meets the stars
My face against the window and my dreams that reach so far
Back to the women whose spirits so fierce and fine
Whose warriors fought for a love like yours and mine

Oh we are all the guardians 
And everyday we start again
To make the demons all depart
Heal the wounds that break the heart

A love that lasts is hard to find
Like the harmony in an old design
But the love of a good woman
The love a good woman 
Stands the test of time

A love that lasts is hard to find
Like the harmony in an old design
But the love of a good woman
The love a good woman 
Stands the test of time

A love that lasts is hard to find
Like the harmony in an old design
But the love of a good woman
The love a good woman 
Stands the test of time",Test of Time
Judy Collins,"My child arrived just the other day,
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay.
He learned to walk while I was away. 
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew,
He'd say, ""I'm gonna be like you, dad.
You know I'm gonna be like you.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

My child turned ten the other day.
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, dad come on let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today,
I've got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's ok.""
He turned away, but his smile never dimmed,
""I'm gonna be like him,"" he said.
Yes, I'm gonna be like him.""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon. 
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, he came from college the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
""I'm proud of you, son. Will you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
""What I'd really like to do is borrow the car keys.
I'll see you later. Can I have them please?""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

Well, I've long since retired and my child moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind.""
He said, ""I'd love to, dad, if I could find the time.""
He said, ""My new job's a hassle, and the kids got the flu,
But it's so nice talking to you, dad.
It's so nice talking to you.""

And as I hung up the phone, 
It occurred to me,
My boy's a lot like me.
My boy's a lot like me.

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,
Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
""When you coming home?""
""I don't know when,
We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""

""We'll get together then, son.
You know we'll have a good time then.""",Cat's in the Cradle
Judy Collins,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs, no diseases
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I can't comprehend
What all this war is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the song of every man
It's the song of everyone

Judy Collins,"In the sky the phantom moon appears at midday

Judy Collins,"All On A Wintry Night
A bright star was shining down 
Upon the little town of Bethlehem 
The shepherds in their fields
Were amazed at the sound
Of angels singing in Jerusalem 

The wise men made their way 
Every traveling night and day 
With myrrh and frankincense and gifts of gold 
While Mary, meek and mild 
Labored with her first born child 
And Joseph sheltered with her from the cold 

The angels and the animals 
Were kneeling to His glory 
To praise the Son of God 
Come once upon a time 
The promised Prince of Peace 
The babe in swaddling clothes 
In his mothers arms did sleep 
Embraced within a lullaby of light 
The angels sang on high 
The song of heaven bright 
Redemption came upon that blessed night 

The trembling voice of shepherd 
The harp that played a melody 
And Joseph knew among the straw 
The glory of divinity 
The promised prince of peace 
So let us sing his praise 
The baby King of light 
And make a place within our manger stall 
His promise is renewed 
Upon this Christmas night For you, for me, for shepherd King and all 

The glory of this humble verse 
Relieves us of our poverty 
And we are rich in blessing 
For He was born for you and me 
The promised Prince of Peace",All on a Wintry Night
Judy Collins,"Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I asked Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
And bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And feed us for Heaven to live with Thee there

There appeared a heavenly light
To guide the wise men to the King of hope
Who was born on Christmas night
The wisdom child and his mother mild
Slept in a manger stall
In a stable low while the cattle moaned
And the angels stood their guard

Come rejoice
Queen and beggar
The homeless man
And the Prince of pride
Saints and vagabonds
Rich and poor
Rejoice in gladness on
Christmas night

Bearing their gifts every wise man knelt
Bending his knees to the King
In the heavenly light while sweet Mary smiled
They heard the angels sing
So every soul on Christmas day learns to find the Grace
With gifts of Myers' and francescence
They bless sweet Jesus face

And the Prince of pride

Late tonight on a city street
some Child of woman and man
Goes to sleep on the frozen gravel
and holds an empty hand
Lift your eyes to the hopeless face
That greets you on your way
Give the tender gift of hope
Make Christmas every day.

Judy Collins,"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even

Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page and stand by me
If thou knows it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes's fountain

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me fur logs, hither
Thou and I will see him dine
Here we bear him thither

Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer

Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed

Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing

I reach out my hand touching death itself
just another holy day in Sarajevo

Hiding from the planes and from the bombing
Fire in the sky burning down my life
There is no more love no more longing

I dream of Peace
I dream of flowers on the hill
I dream I see my mother smiling
When I close my eyes I dream of Peace

Then the fire came falling from the sky
There is no one left who can protect me

Feeding on the dreams of all the children
War's an evil bird flying in the dark

I dream of flowers on the hill
I dream I see my mother smiling
When I close my eyes I dream of Peace

You are tall and strong and I am just a child.
Can't we live in a peace stop the flowing blood
Make a blessed world where I can be a child.

Do you dream of Peace?
Do you dream of flowers on the hill?
Do you dream you see your mother smiling?
When you close your eyes do you dream of Peace?

You have struggled here in Sarajevo
Courage you have shown to the watching world
We have prayed and wept for Sarajevo

Children dance again in Sarajevo 
Now the sun can shine 
Now the birds can sing

The lights are turned way down low

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

You stole my heart away
I'm writing you to say that
You were my original hero

My fabulous prince and my lover
You had the right answer to the riddle
But the years went by
And finally I left you for another
Saying this is love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
But I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

You were just the first of many men
I thought you would set me free
I took what I could
Made you a promise
That you wouldn't bind me

Then I would see a new smile
See the future bright and shining
I turned and tossed
In a sea so deep no one could find me
Saying this must be love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
And I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

Finally a man came along
I gave him all I had
I would have gone
To the end of the Earth for him
If he'd asked me

He only turned on his heel
And walked back the way he came
All all of my tears
And the pieces of my heart
Couldn't turn him around

Maybe I've paid the price
For breaking all those hearts
Maybe my dice will come up this time
With a lover that's really mine

So can you say you forgive
The girl you used to love
I've played the stakes high
And I've paid for my crimes
In the name of love

I'm sorry for the pain I caused you
I was a crazy girl in those days
But I have been burned
And, darling, I've learned
That lovin' and leavin' don't pay

Judy Collins,"I would have sworn I could have flown
There were some things I hadn't known
Stripped to the soul I'd reached the bone
In sanity and grace

You gave me wings but took the sky
I am caught in a world that's flying by
Right on course headed to the dawn
Where my heart has gone

I had a dream that we were free
Free to sail on just you and me
Far from the force of gravity
Flung to the brightest star
There is a dream beyond my dream
Wearing a face I'd seldom seen
I caught a glimpse within your eyes
I saw the shadow rise

Through miles of stars
A sea of light 
Bright as a beacon on the darkest night
Love finds a way
Through stars and stones 
To let us know we are already home
Already

Half of my heart wants you to stay
Laugh at the night and rue the day
Born on the wings of a night that burns
Loving to be unlearned

Better than nothing half a heart
Better to go than not to start
Who can I ask? Who knows the part
Of sanity and grace

It could have been a fantasy
Was I in truth already free
Could I pretend I did not see
Say there was not a trace
Where would I hide the truth of you
What would I do that I could do
Gone are the things I thought I knew
Of sanity and grace

Through miles of stars
A sea of light 
Bright as a beacon on the darkest night
Love finds a way
Through stars and stones

Burned in the fire and lace

Lily of the Valley
Lily of the Valley

They called her Lily of the Valley
And she lived beside the river
The youngest of her sisters
And the prettiest of them all
She was courted by the men in town
She could have married anyone
The one she made her husband
Was the handsomest of all.

They were married in a chapel
Lily bore him seven children
And every night he put her down
And made her feel ashamed. 

He took the face she used to wear
And put a look of sorrow there
The more he made her suffer
The more she felt to blame

No more tears Lily
Don't cry anymore
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lilly 
We know how you've tried
Fighting for your life was not a crime.

One night Lily turned to him
Before he raised his hand to her
One more time she said, and not again
He laughed and threw another punch
The blow knocked Lily to the floor,
Somehow she grabbed the kitchen knife
And stabbed her husband dead. 

The jury they decided it was murder in the first degree
They said she had provoked him
With her wild and wicked talk.
They hanged her by the river
Where so many times she wandered
And left her children motherless
In sorrow and in shock.

No more tears Lily
Don't cry anymore
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lilly
We know how you've tried
Fighting for your life was not a crime.

A soldier in a uniform is meant to kill the enemy
But Lilly in her own defense was framed to take the fall
Her children watched their father beat their mother all too often
The battlefields of families are the saddest of them all. 

The willow weeps for Lily
As its branches touch the water
The wind is crying, ""Lily"" 
As it sighs along the shore
The river's singing ""Lily --
We all know that you are innocent""
You were promised marriage
But you had to fight a war.

No more tears Lily
Don't cry any more
Tears of yours won't fall another time.
Don't cry Lily
We know how you tried

Judy Collins,"I saw a photograph of you and me
Standing together by the sea
Light on the water so beautiful in the dawn
I am looking into your eyes
Before the secrets, before the lies,
Your lips are smiling as though you meant to go on.

I don't remember the words
That you said to me
I don't remember the words
But the melody 
Haunts me

I found a rose that you gave to me
Pressed in a book of your poetry
Deathless prose like the love I thought that we shared
You left my life with no backward look
I crushed the rose and I burned the book
I cursed the day that I ever thought you could care

I don't remember the words
That you said to me
I don't remember the words
But the melody
Haunts me

Melody, melody, melody
Melody, melody, melody

There's not a day I don't think of you
There's not a think that I know to do
To keep your memory from invading my heart
And though your flowers and books are gone
The melody of you lingers on
You are a part of my song so what can I do

I don't remember the words
That you said to me
I don't remember the words
But the melody 
Haunts me

Melody, melody, melody

Judy Collins,"Time slips by in the hourglass
You can hear your name
Sand slides through the stranger's hand
As he deals the game.
All the candles are burning low
No more cradles and no more snow
Bet your life on a lucky roll
Play your queen, you could win your soul,
Stakes are high you can live or die
To risk everything.

In your goblet the wine is black
As a moonless night
Wet your lips before you kiss
The blazing light
Bets are off but the game is on,
Drop the armor you counted on
All your armies are fled and gone
Win your king, you can play your pawn
Take your time, you have just begun
To risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Through the window you see the storm
That is gathering,
Painted gypsies on dappled horses are galloping
Through the trees in the howling wind
Down the hills to the river bend
Shadow ghosts that are blind as night
Shrieking curses against the night,
Daring you to come join their flight
And risk everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

There is nothing to hold you now
To your fault or mine
Fallen idols and martyred souls
Are the only kind
Feet of clay in the emerald skies
Birds of prey when the dreamer dies
Perfect crosses perfect your lies
Burning saints in the flaming skies
Bet your life every promise dies
All that's left for you to try
Is risking everything.

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive
To risk everything.

Oh, Oh

Catch your tears in a golden sieve
Don't regret what you did to live
Don't forget that you must forgive.
To risk everything.

Judy Collins,"A dream came to me at night
When the boats were in the sea
A dream of the black death of earth
Two voices came singing to me.

Wind, water, fire, and stone.
Storms of sand, closing over the sun
Sand, fire, water, and wind
How can we begin again.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

Oh the rivers are poisoned
And the lakes are gone
The dolphins are dying
And the whales have lost their song.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

Once I saw a man 
Who said he'd seen a flock of nightengales
Once a child recalled the sound of rain
Like silver angel's wings.

Like a lost and homeless thing 
The planet spins her way through space.
Drugged and battered like a woman
Who can't recall her face.

Remembering the way she used to shine
Rivers in the sea
Shine, herons on the wing, 
And hear the crickets sing
A million forest birds 
The sea her mantle green 
Like a banner of bright hair 
Around her shoulders

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the world any brighter
By even one star. 

Awake, awake, awake.

Wind, water, fire, and stone.
Storms of sand, closing over the sun
Sand, fire, water, and wind
How can we begin again.

But you can't sink a rainbow
In a world that is green
You can't make the night any brighter
By even one star.

Awake, awake, awake.

A dream came to me at night
When the boats were in the sea
A dream of the bright death of earth.","Wind, Water, Fire and Stone"
Judy Collins,"Once upon a time in another world 
On a hill that overlooked the sea
There was once a garden of beauty and of grace
Lovely as a dream could ever be.

Then the roses bled and the lilies broke
On the day that death came to the garden
Hidden in the flowers, meant to break the heart
Flames that burst like blossoms in the garden.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden 

Name them all by heart, name them one by one
Countries where a child has lost tomorrow
Count the deadly flowers in the fields and woods
Count them like a rosary of sorrow.

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me,
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden. 

Where the children played in the summer light
Running through the flowers on the hill
Laughter in their voices, hope within their hearts
Knowing they would live forever more.

I have seen a child barely five or six,
Counting bombs and tears, his childhood broken,
Give him back the garden, give him back his life
Give him back a world where love is spoken.

Let us join our voices far across the sea
Singing all together of the garden,
Let the roses bloom, let the lillies grow,
Let us live together for the children,
In our lovely garden.",Voices
Judy Collins,"She is a weaver
Through her hands the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars
She sings and sighs as the shuttle flies
Through the yarn like a Kerry dancer
Pink and purple velvet red for a lover's bed

Living north of San Francisco
With a man who build his house alone
Living peaceful in the country
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

She is a spinner
In her hands the wooden wheel turns the wool around
The around again
The gypsy from Bolinas sits and plays the mandolin
Faces smile in the firelight of a foggy night

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says it's peaceful where she is living
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

You can see the bridges of the city
Hanging in the air by steel and stone
She says it's peaceful where she's living
The lights of the Golden Gate will lead her home

She is a weaver 
Through her hand the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars
She is my sister, the baby born when I was older
Her hands are light, her hair is bright as the summer sun

Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says it's peaceful in the country

Judy Collins,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas
Judy Collins,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Vingt ans d'amour, c'est l'amour fol
Mille fois tu pris ton bagage
Mille fois je pris mon envol
Et chaque meuble se souvient

Des éclats des vieilles tempêtes
Plus rien ne ressemblait à rien
Tu avais perdu le goût de l'eau
Et moi celui de la conquête

De l'aube claire jusqu'à la fin du jour

Moi, je sais tous tes sortilèges
Tu sais tous mes envoûtements

Il faut bien que le corps exulte

Il nous fallut bien du talent

Que vivre en paix pour des amants

You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet

Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you, before it's too late",Desperado
Judy Collins,"I'll learn to love the fallow way
When winter draws the valley down
And stills the rivers in their storm
And freezes all the little brooks
Time when our steps slow to the song
Of falling flakes and crackling flames 
When silver stars are high and still
Deep in the velvet of the night sky

The crystal time the silence times
I'll learn to love their quietness
While deep beneath the glistening snow
The black earth dreams of violets
I'll learn to love the fallow way

I'll learn to love the fallow way
When all my colors fade to white
And flying birds fold back their wings
Upon my anxious wondering's
The sun has slanted all her rays
Across the vast and harvest plains
My memories mingle in the dawn
I dream a joyful vagabonds

The crystal times the silence times
I'll learn to love their quietness 
When deep beneath the glistening snow
The black earth dreams in of violets
I'll learn to love the fallow times

No drummer comes across the plains
To tell of triumph or of pain
No word far off battle's cry
To draw me out or draw me nigh
I'll learn to love the fallow way

I'll learn to love the fallow way
And gather in the patient fruits 
And after autumns blaze and burn
I'll know the full still, deep roots
That nothing seem to know or need

That crack the ice in frozen ponds 
And slumbering in winter's folds 
Have dreams of green and blue and gold 
I'll learn to love the fallow way 
And listening for blossoming 
Of my own heart once more in spring 

As sure as time, as sure as snow
As sure as moonlight, wind and stars
The fallow time will fall away
The sun will bring an April day
And I will yield to Summer's way",The Fallow Way
Judy Collins,"Nothing lasts forever, you should know that by now
Good times, heartache
You'll get through this trouble though you may not know how
Your heart won't break

If you have a vision of your destiny
Tears can't stop you
Hidden in your heart is everything you can be
You'll be fine

Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

You know where you're goin' even when you are lost
Big world spinning
Just stay in the center where you think you belong
Gently turning

Run off with the Gypsies to the carnival
Tight rope walker
Mysteries and miracles wherever you go
You'll be fine

Nothing lasts forever

Nothing lasts forever
Nothing lasts forever

Watch the way the rainbow makes its way to the sun
Yellow, purple
Even in the shadows where the light doesn't shine
Magic silver

You could dream that all of this was meant to be
Daylight dawning
Nothing lasts forever, you should know that by now
You'll be fine

Nothing lasts forever

Judy Collins,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It
Is

Judy Collins,"Twas in the merry month of May, 
When the green buds were swellin'. 
A young man on his deathbed lay 
For the love of Barbara Allen. 

He sent his servant to the town, 
Sent him to her dwellin'.
""My master's sick and and he sends for you
If you are Barbara Allen.""

Then slowly, slowly she got up 
Slowly she went nigh him, 
And all she said when she got there was,
""My true love, you're dyin'.""

He turned his face unto the wall, 
Death was in him dwellin'
""Adieu, adieu, to all my sweet friends all. 
Be kind to Barbara Allen."" 

As she was walked down the road to home
She saw his hearse a'coming
""Oh, lay him down on the cold, cold ground
That I may gaze upon him.""

""Oh mother, mother make my bed
Make it soft and narrow.
For my true love has died today.
I'll die for him tomorrow.""

They buried her by the old church tower 
Him they lay beside her, 
And from her grave, grew a red, red rose, 
And from his grave, grew a briar. 

They grew to the top of the old church tower, 
Till they could grow no higher, 
And there they twined in a true love's knot, 
The red, red rose and the briar.",Barbara Allen
Judy Collins,"Black, black, black is the color of my true love's hair

I love the grass where on he goes
If he on earth no more I did see
My life will quickly fade away.

I'll climb up the mountain for to mourn and weep
For satisfied, I'll never sleep
I'll write to you in a few little lines
I'll suffer death ten thousand times

The time is gone that we have seen
But still I long for the day to come

Judy Collins,"Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now 
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Schemes and dreams and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads,
They say I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow

Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
Where we two have passed so many blithesome days,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

Chorus
O ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.
But me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond.

I mind where we parted on yon shady glen, 
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond. 
Where in purple hue, the Heiland hills we view, 
And the moon shinin' out from the gloamin'.

Chorus

The wee bird may sing and the wild flowers spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping:
The broken heart will ken nae second spring again,
And the world does not know how we're grievin'.

Judy Collins,"Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from heaven
Like the first dew fall, on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where his feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the one light, Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken like the first morning
Of the new day

Cha grin d'amour dure toute la vie
The joys of love are but a moment long
The pain of love endures the whole life

Your eyes kissed mine
I saw the love in them shine
You brought me heaven right then
When your eyes kissed mine

My love loves me
And all the wonders I see
A rainbow shines in my window
My love loves me

And now he's gone
Like a dream that fades into dawn
But the words stay locked in my heartstrings
My love loves me

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now can see.

And grace my Fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear

I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep

She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

Is wonderful, wonderful

Judy Collins,"In the bleak mid winter
Frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone

Snow had fallen, snow on snow
Snow on snow
In the bleak mid winter
Long, long ago

Heaven cannot hold Him
Nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign

In the bleak mid winter
A stable place sufficed
The Lord, God, Almighty
Jesus Christ

Angels and archangels
May have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air

But only His mother
In her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved
With a kiss

What can I give Him
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb

If I were a wise man
I would do my part
Yet, what can I give Him?
Give my heart

In the bleak mid winter
Frosty wind made moan
For earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone

Snow had fallen, snow on snow
Snow on snow
In the bleak mid winter
Long, long ago

Judy Collins,"Once there was a girl with a dream in her heart
Wild as the wind was her hope
In those far off days she could dream all she would
No one but her heart believed her hope
All she could do was to hold to her dream
Catching every rainbow's light
Praying for the miracle to come to pass
Even on the darkest night 

That she would fly beyond the sky
Beyond the stars beyond the heavens
Beyond the dawn she'd carry on 
Until her dreams had all come true

Once there was a woman with stars in her eyes
Flying on the wings of her dreams
She had come so far it was hard to believe 
Changed the world from what it seemed
Equal to the ones who had claimed the sky
Now she flew with them beneath the sun
But she dared a dream beyond all her dreams
She would take the helm and be the one

And she would fly beyond the sky
Beyond the stars beyond the heavens 
Beyond the dawn she'd carry on
Until her dreams have all come true

She had led the way beyond darkness
For other dreamers who would dare the sky
She has led us to believe in dreaming 
Given us the hope that we can try 

Now in the grace of her dance of delight
Shining in her destiny
Here is the promise for all our hopes
Telling us we can be free And we will fly beyond the sky

Beyond the stars beyond the heavens 
Beyond the dawn we'll carry on
Until our dreams have all come true

To those who fly, we sing to you 

Into the sky 

Beyond the stars 

We'll reach our dreams",Beyond the Sky

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The warm and Rocky weather,

Looking for tomorrow's time,
Peace of mind.

As my life spills into yours,
Changing with the hours
Filling up the world with time,
Turning time to flowers,
I can show you all the songs
That I never sang to one man before.

You have climbed the hills with me 
To the mountain shelter,
Taken off the days one by one,
Setting them to breathe in the sun.

All the willow winding paths

This is what I ask you for;

For like a breeze, it'd stir a dying flame

Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one? Made me feel unkind
So fare thee well, sweet love of mine

They're made of glass and they cut like wounding lies

Who was the one that stole my mind?

Who was the one? Made me feel unkind
So fare thee well, sweet love of mine

Don't look back to where you once had been
Look straight ahead when you're walking through the rain
And find a light, if the path gets dark and cold

Judy Collins,"It was seven months since 9/11
And the work was almost done
It was seven months since 9/11
And the work had just begun
Ground Zero lit the evening sky
Like a beacon through the heart
The searchlights drove through Heaven's doors
And blew them far apart
A few miles north on the Hudson River
We had gathered for a sort of wake
Nobody felt like celebrating
But the Firemen needed some kind of break
They'd been to so many funerals
And seen so many God-awful sights
They'd been to Ground Zero from dawn to dusk
And round the clock some nights

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

I was all dressed up like the rest of the crowd
At the Roxy Club that night
The men and women in Uniform
Tried hard to keep it light
Kevin Bacon played and sang
And folks began to smile
Chris Bodi played his silver horn
With rhythm and with style
I sang my song Amazing Grace
And people laughed and cried
Ronan Tynan sang Danny Boy and
Not an eye was dry
Steve Buscemi spoke of life
At Engine 55,
Of how these heroes
Stayed the course and
Saved so many lives

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

A burly man with a handsome face
Stuck out his hand and smiled
Say, meet my wife, we like your songs
We've been with you mile for mile
Though he had a rugged face
I knew I saw the hurt
Then he pointed to a spot above the collar of his shirt.
Just look here on the back of my neck,
There's a tattoo, can you see?
Just right here, I got up close
And saw the number 343,
The number of the Firemen
Who were lost upon that day
The numbers of those heroes,
Ground Zero was their grave

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Those firemen loaded up with gear
Climbed to their death's that day
Along with all the other hundreds
Blasted on their way
Police and EMS and those
On whom death took its toll
And more whose dreams will never dawn,
More than three thousand souls
I left the party after that
I could not stay my tears,
For all our gifts for all our hopes
For all our nameless fears
For all our heroes, men and women
Lost on that black day
Those firemen with courage
In their hearts so strong and brave,
Who made sure in their final hours
There were 30,000 saved.

They've gone to where there are no tears
And every heart is gay,
And they won't be forgotten on a sunny day

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day.",Kingdom Come

Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

Now, I'm so sorry I made you cry,

So come on, baby, let's shine them shoes,
Come on, mamma, let's lose the blues,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

Won't you listen to the way the guitar plays,
Listen to the way that the bass part lays,
Down in the middle of the tune and the rhythm so strong.
Boom be' boom goes the big bass drum,
Piano man's going to take his turn,
Look out, baby! The Singer's going to sing his song.

He says, ""Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,
Come on, mamma, can't you see,
We can make our troubles fly away.

Sugar pie, you sure fly high,
Make me feel like the Fourth of July,
Bump my head right up against the moon.

Jump and wiggle to the jiggle of the fiddle,
Don't stop to think about it or you'll realize real soon:

This song don't mean a thing,
But it sure is fun to sing,
It's a silly little diddle,
I was hoping it would make you smile.
Ain't got a lot to say,
But it's kinda fun to play, 
If it gets you dancing, well the diddle
It'll be worthwhile.

So, Come on, baby, won't you dance with me,
Come on, mamma, can't you see,
We can make our troubles fly away.
Come on, baby, let's don't fight,
Come on, mamma, let's fly tonight,
Come on, baby, let's dance the night away.

Come on, baby, show 'em what you got,
We can make our troubles fly away.

Judy Collins,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary
Judy Collins,"I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Judy Collins,"If I could go back home to the place I was raised
I'd catch the next bus and be there in a few days
But I just can't do it, I was raised on the road
I've got no place to go to, so l guess I'll stay on

There's dreams that I've had, I wrote in songs yesterday
But the waves of the world have washed them away
Still I carry them with me wherever I go
They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home

I've kept all my memories buried deep in my heart
Where time cannot touch them and rip them apart
Still I look for the hour when I will be free
From constantly dying and living on dreams

If I could go back home to the place I was raised
I'd catch the next bus and be there in a few days
My dreams in my pockets, my life, that's gone wrong
They're my only possessions on this slow boat back home
",Slow Boat
Judy Collins,"I went down to the place
Where I knew, she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow

I said, ""Mother I'm frightened
The thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone""

She said, “I'll be with you
My shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go”

And the night came on, it was very calm
I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, “Go back, go back to the world”

We were fighting in Egypt
When they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die

There was this terrible sound
And my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side

He said, “Try to go on
Take my books, take my gun
And remember, my son, how they lied”

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young

We were locked in this kitchen
I took to religion
And wondered how long she would stay

I needed so much
To have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way

But my son and my daughter
Climbed out of the water
Cryin' papa, you promised to play

And they lead me away to the great surprise
It's papa, don't peek, papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the World

Now I look for her always
I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer

Saying, “When will she summon me?
When will she come to me?
What must I do to prepare?”

Then she bends to my longing
Like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says, “When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song”

Now the crickets are singing
The vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair

I'll go down to Bill's Bar
I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there

And yes, here's to the few
Who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care

And the night comes on and it's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
And she says, “Go back, go back to the world”

Judy Collins,"Well I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings

Wearing wings you looked so grand, wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky?

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice

Once or twice, I heard you did, once or twice
Were you wondering, was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

So lately you've been hiding, it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime

Overtime, I've lost my fire, overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm getting tired, slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway, slowin' down, down, down

Judy Collins,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

Judy Collins,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood
Judy Collins,"I'll be damned
Here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you happened to call
And here I sit
Hand on the telephone
Hearing a voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes
Were bluer than robin's eggs
My poetry was lousy you said
Where are you calling from?
A booth in the midwest
Ten years ago
I bought you some cufflinks
You brought me something
We both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
And there you stayed
Temporarily lost at sea
The Madonna was yours for free
Yes the girl on the half-shell
Would keep you unharmed

Now I see you standing
With brown leaves falling around
And snow in your hair
Now you're smiling out the window
Of that crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes out white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could have died then and there

Now you're telling me
You're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You who are so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Because I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes I loved you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid",Diamonds and Rust
Judy Collins,"An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

Judy Collins,"Once I was a soldier
And I fought on foreign sands for you
Once I was a hunter
And I brought home fresh meat for you
Once I was a lover
And I searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another
To tell you I was just a lie

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me

And though you have forgotten
All of our rubbish dreams
I find myself searching
Through the ashes of our ruins
For the days when we smiled
And the hours that ran wild
With the magic of our eyes
And the silence of our words

And sometimes I wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me?",Once I Was
Judy Collins,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
In the land that I heard of
Once, once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare you dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds
Are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me

Judy Collins,"I still see my brother Michael,
pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry

I kept all my brother's letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head
His words said ""Not to worry, doing fine""
It was his way of trying to ease my mind
While I was trying not to read between the lines

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn't seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world

Then it was football games and homecoming and
picking out our dresses for the prom
With my brother in some desert dodging bullets when he wasn't dodging bombs
While we went from the land of brave and free
To just being afraid to disagree
While I was being brought down to my knees by

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much to lose, so much to miss
It doesn't seem fair that an innocent boy
Should have to carry the weight of the world

It was the middle of December when the Army sent my brother home at last
While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground

The weight of the world, too heavy to lift
So much was lost, so much was missed
It doesn't seem fair that any boy or any girl
Should have to carry the weight of the world",Weight of the World
Judy Collins,"Oh, oh, I was raised on rock and roll
Oh, and that music filled my soul

I've been wild since I was young
Takin' my freedom out on the run
Fought the rules, fought the ropes
When I was rolling, when I was broke

Did my drinking, had my fun
Nothing ever got in my way
Did my loving as I pleased
""This is livin',"" I used to say

I am an eagle and I've got to fly
Climbin' against the wind
I am a spirit who will never break
Never have a heart to mend

Oh, oh, I was raised on rock and roll
Oh, and that music filled my soul

Somewhere on that freedom road
Started fighting for my own soul
Thought of Jimmy and Janis, too
Livin' fast til they were through

Then my heart began to break
Fallin' when I wanted to fly
Someone said, ""Gal, slow down
You're too young, too young to die""

Even an eagle has to fall sometimes
Climbing against the wind
Even a strong heart has to break
And learn to love and heal again

All that runnin' got to me
Could I stop and still be free?
Could I break and still be whole?
Would I live to rock and roll?

Got some friends who stood by me
Tellin' me that I would survive
Said, ""You're strong, you sing your song
Know you're lucky to be alive""

Still my spirit yearns to run
Chasing every star in the sky
Wild and free I'll always be
I've got someone, I've got me

I am an eagle and I have to fly
Climbing against the wind
I've had a heart that had to break
To learn to heal and love again

Judy Collins,"Hey now, where are you going
Where are you going to, my friend
Said I’m going out to find
The pastures of plenty
I believe they’re out there somewhere

Did you hear about the girl
Alone in the world
Thought she was losing her mind
She found it in the discarded refuse pile
Down near the railroad line
A book of sonnets, torn and tattered
A few remained intact
One held the key, she said to me

Sometimes you talk but I can’t hear a sound
Sometimes I look down, find my feet off the ground

She prayed for the strength to run to the boxcar
To pull herself up for the ride

We sit so close for a while
You reach out for me in the low light so clear

Hanging on by, oh, the thinnest thread
Sometimes I see the faintest glimpse
Sometimes I feel I’d be better off in bed

She fell from the sky,
She fell very far and Kansas she says is the name of the star.

She brings you good news or haven't  you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle, what happened was just this.
The wind began to switch, the house to pitch, and suddenly the hinges started 
to unhitch.
Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing 
for a hitch.
And oh what happen'd was rich.
The house began to pitch,the kitchen took a slitch,it landed on the wicked 
witch in the middle of a ditch.
Which was not a healthy situation for a wicked witch.

Judy Garland,"I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning.
I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
But I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me.

I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby - like her. 
But maybe someday you'll realize that glamour isn't the only thing in this world. 
If your show's a flop you'll find you can't eat glamour for breakfast. 
Anyway, I might be pretty good-looking myself when I grow out of this ugly-duckling stage. 
And you're no Clark Gable yourself. 
But that's all right. 
Don't worry about me, I'll recover. 
Time is a great healer. 
But in the future if we should meet again at the opera or at a ball, and 
I'm dazzling in my diamonds and pearls and ermine wraps, 
And surrounded by lords and dukes and princes, you'll probably be sorry. 
And you'll probably realize that life is just an idiot's delight. 
And as I speed through the night into the abyss of oblivion, 
I can only say thanks - thanks for the memory.

I'll find two eyes just a little bit bluer,
I'll find a heart just a little bit truer.
I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me.",I Cried for You
Judy Garland,"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sang was this
Ahh

Poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one note, yelled willy nilly
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace

Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class, by himself, by gum

Poor Johnny one note got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note, howled like the north wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned 'round in his grave

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Every one was mute, Johnny stood alone

Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo all were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping
Traffic ceased its roar and they tell us Niagara stood still

He stopped the train whistles, boat whistles
Steam whistles, cop whistles
All whistles bowed to his skill
Ahh

Sing Johnny one note, sing out with gusto
And just overlord all the crowd
So sing Johnny one note, out loud
Sing Johnny one note
Sing Johnny one note out loud

",Johnny One Note
Judy Garland,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Judy Garland,"As I wash my dishes, I'll be following a plan
Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind
So I'll keep repeating in my mind

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue
Remember somewhere the sun is shining
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you

A heart full of joy and gladness
Will always banish sadness and strife
So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life

So always look for the silver lining
And try to find the sunny side of life
",Look for the Silver Lining
Judy Garland,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Way above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

They bring the flowers that bloom in May
So when it's raining have no regrets
Because it isn't raining rain you know
It's raining violets

You know they'll bring crowds of daffodils
So just keep looking for a bluebird
And listening for his song

Judy Garland,"The sound of applause is delicious
It's a thrill to have the world at your feet
The praise of the crowd, it's exciting
But I've learned that's not what makes a life complete

There's one thing you can do for the rest of your days
That's worth more than applause
The screaming crowd, the bouquets

Make someone happy
Make just one someone happy
Make just one heart the heart you sing to
One smile that cheers you
One face that lights when it nears you
One man you're everything to

that those happy days again will bring.

Sing before breakfast, never quiet a thing.
Before you eat your shredded wheat, sing, sing, sing!

Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye
four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie.
When the pie was opened and set before the king,
four and twenty blackbirds started into sing.

Sing a song that mentions love and you will yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

Sing a song of cheer again,
the skies above will be clear again,
those happy days are here again,
sing a song of cheer again.

let your frown turn summerset, get yourself a good quartet.

Judy Garland,"Fifteen thousand times a day,
I hear a voice within me say,
""Hide yourself behind a screen,
You shouldn't be heard, you shouldn't be seen,
You're just an awful in-between!"".

That's what I am, an in-between,
It's just like smallpox quarantine!
I can't do this, I can't go there,
I'm just a circle in a square,
I don't fit in anywhere!

I'm past the stage of doll and carriage,
I'm not the age to think of marriage;
I'm too old for toys
And I'm too young for boys,
I'm just an in-between!

I'm not a child, all children bore me,
I'm not grown-up, grown-ups ignore me,
And in every sense
I'm just on the fence,
I'm just an in-between!

I'll be glad when momma lets me go to dances
And have romances.
I'll be glad to have a party dress that boys will adore,
A dress that touches the floor.

I'm sick and tired of bedtime stories,
I'm so inspired by love and glories,
But I guess it's no use,
I still get Mother Goose!
I'm just an in-between!

I'm allowed to go to picture shows,
That is, if nurse is feeling able;
But we only go to Mickey Mouse,
I'm not allowed Clark Gable!
It's such an imposition
For a girl who's got ambition
To be an in-between!

My dad says I should bother more
About my lack of Grammar;
Huh!  The only thing that bothers me
Is my lack of glamour!
Why, if I use a lipstick and a powder puff,
Who knows, I might be Garbo, (in the rough)
Instead of in-between!

I'll be glad when uncle Jim
Can't call me ""Precious child!"",
That simply drives me wild!
I'll be glad to have a date
That doesn't grow on a tree,
A date that's not history.

I'll be so glad when I have grown some,
All by myself I get so lonesome,
And I hope and pray
For the day
When I'll be sweet sixteen,
Then I won't have to be an in-beteen!",In-Between
Judy Garland,"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, oh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!
Smile when you should cry,
For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!","It Never Rains, But What It Pours"
Judy Garland,"Oceans apart and with only the blue between
Since we're apart
I'm yearning
I tell my heart
We must wait for another dawn
When he may be returning

How I regret the night he sailed for another shore
Will he come into sight to leave my arms no more?
I'll kiss him again
He'll know right from the very start
That we were never meant to be oceans apart

Oceans apart and with only the blue between us
Since we're apart
I'm yearning
I'll kiss him again
He'll know right from the very start
That we were never meant to be oceans apart.

Judy Garland,"There's an old love refrain that has known the world over,
It's sweetness both princes and peasants may calim,
Like a bird on the wing or a bee in the clover,
No matter the language the song is the same.

While the stars above begin to peep,
They're lighting the windows of heaven, angels watch over you.

Thunder comes in spring?
Once upon a time it seems
All the world was wrapped in dreams
Playful little fellas, so they tell us
Said Let's have our fling!
Spring is in the air, you know!

So, when the thunder starts to thunder don't run home and cry

The news that's going round?

For there's a bloomin' law agin'

And he took me by the hand,
And he said, ""How's poor old Ireland
And how does she stand?""

""She's the most distressful country
That ever yet was seen;
They're hanging men and women there
For wearing of the green.""

Then since the color we must wear
Is England's cruel red,
Sure Ireland's songs will ne'er forget
The blood that they have shed.

You may take the shamrock from your hat now,
Cast it on the sod,
But 'twill take root and flourish still,
Tho' under foot it's trod.

When the law can stop the blades of green
From growing as they grow,
And when the leaves in summertime
Their verdue dare not show,

Then I will change the color that I
Wear in my canteen;
But 'till that day, please God, I'll stick
To wearing of the green.",The Wearing of the Green

The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights

The broken dates - the endless waits
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates
The conversation - with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain - no more strain
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punch - drunk

The pulled out fur - of cat and cur
The fine mismatching - of a him and her
I've learned my lesson - but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh - the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you - 'til the day I die""
The self deception - that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals - it soon reveals
The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care - no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir - I much prefer

I don't like quiet - and I wish I were

Judy Garland,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game
Jamboree Jones was the gentleman's name.",Jamboree Jones
Judy Garland,"Just imagine
That he loves me dearly.
Just imagine
That I'm here sincerely.
I'm pretending
That he's sending
Love note ending
""I love you!"".

Seems that he's there
As the day is closing;
On his knees there,
I hear him proposing!
He's not present,
Still it's pleasant,
Just imagine that it's true.

Have a very, very merry Christmas.

Christmas Eve when you retire,

So be jolly,
Have a holiday as gay as holly.
May the ones you love be near you
With the laugh of friends to cheer you.

Like the angels sing,
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree

Judy Garland,"What now my love
Now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul
What now my love
Now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

I'd be a fool to go on and on

If I should live or die

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it, and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain, it's the final curtain

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tells you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's abov, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play, could guarantee

I was a fool to fall, and get that way

Was all the preparation that they made

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Judy Garland,"And the gods beheld that the thunder warriors fought hard and brave in the
""battle of metal"". However, they wanted to challenge them once again. This test
Was called the ""battle of steel"". In order to aid them in their holy quest it
Was decided to bestow unto them four magic utensils.

So the gods called upon the old dwarf and the mighty wizard and told them what
They sought. The dwarf took the sword Nothung, once belonging to ""Siegfried
The dragon-slayer"", fused and smithed from it's steel four shakels of metal.
The wizard created the same number of amulets from the skin of a black demon.
He then took the silver shaded blood of a dead unicorn from which he drew four
Magic runes, each drenched with natural power.

The power and strength of a bear would be given to the bearer of the hammer
""giants death"", the speed of a hunting hawk to the bearer of the bow ""heart
Hunter"", the brutality of a lone wolf to the bearer of the axe skullcrusher,
And the deafening roar of a black lion to the bearer of the sword souleater.
Then the dwarf mounted the shakels of metal on the amulets whilst reciting
Ancient words of magic power. Thereafter the amulets were presented to the
Dragon lords, who brought them to midgard, home of the thunder warriors. They
Received this gift and a mighty power flushed through their veins. It was the
Power of magic-the magic of steel.

Suddenly thunder rocked the silence, lightning crushed the roof of the hall,
And the two mightiest gods of Valhalla -Thor and Odin- stood on the stage. The
God of thunder held his hammer on high. Odin wailed his spear into the
Audience. Any wimp present knew now that death was imminent. They disappeared
As quickly as they came.

In the blink of an eye the thunder warriors conquered the stage: Once again they
Would ride side by side with their legion of doom, under the sign of the
Wizard, to their next test- the ""battle of steel""... So they fought with the
Power of metal and again were victorious. They devoured the hearts and spilled
The blood of their enemies. Their weapons found the hearts of all decievers and
Liers, crushing their bodies to the ground. After the ""battle of steel"" was
Over the ground was covered by a sea of blood. From that day on the four
Thunder warriors knew that they were forever bound by metal.",Main Title [From Babes on Broadway]

I'll be glad to have a party dress that boys will adore

That simply drives me wild
I'll be glad to have a date that doesn't grow on a trees

But out of the blue I dreamed I met you and you said to me, hi, ya gate
Millions have heard you play Chopin, the critics applaud and approve
But millions more would simply adore to hear you get in the groove

You won't believe it, you'll think it's a dream
To hear them riffing it, right on the beam
But when you hear trumpets give out a call, you'll know
The joint is really jumpin' down at Carnegie hall

Instead of Strauss they play Irving Berlin
Instead of Brahms it's, begin the begin
Those classic ackies are due for a fall since
The joint is really jumpin' down at Carnegie hall

They're playing
Ta-tlee-a-ti, ta-tlee-a-ti, with Shostakovich
Ta-tlee-a-ti, ta-tlee-a-ti, Mozart and Bach
Ta-tlee-a-ti, ta-tlee-a-ti, and they don't know which
'Cause anything can happen when they start to rock

The philharmonic was so dignified
But now they're groovy and starting to ride
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall
'Cause the joint is really jumpin' down in Carnegie hall

They-hey swing everything with a ding, dong
And when the maestro gives them a beat, it's a
Reel beat that starts 'em to toot with a root-toot, that's a bit of alright
And even Jose Iturbi getting hep, he's hep, he's hep, boy

Tschai-Tschai-Tschai-kovsky would really be hurt
To hear 'em jivin' his piano concert

Was suddenly real

And pray you'd hear me

First he'd grab, the ladies fair 
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare! 
Especially those with jewels
Those with jewels to spare 
Especially those with jewels

Then he'd set the ship afire...what a pretty funeral 
Funeral pyre! 
Mack the Black, what a pretty funeral 
Mack the Black, marvelous funeral pyre! 
Though the years this black Macocco 
Lead his pirate reign 
His claim to fame was as black as his name 
All around the Spanish Maine 
When he'd a make his daily rounds 
Gals would trail him like a pack of hounds 
Ev'ry night he'd have a date Ladies go to pieces 
Over pieces of eight.

And he'll whack ya in half!

Perhaps it's better that he disappeared 
Yet I know, that he was bad 
I could fall in love with,
Fall in love with the lad! 
Evening star, if you see Mack 
Stop his wanderings and guide him back 
I'll be waiting, patiently 
By the Caribbean or Caribbean Sea.
Is that the Caribbean Sea? 
And if I met this famous pirate 
Met him face to face 
You think I'd run and hide my head 
And scream around the place 
Why no I'd just sashay around 
Displaying all my charms 
And soon I'd have him walk the plank 
Right into my arms

When Joe heard that it broke his heart!

In Hollywood Minnie traveled far,
They changed her name to Minnie La Mar,
And pretty soon she became a star,

But one day Minnie got awful mad,
a guy got fresh and she said, ""You cad!
My heart belongs to my Trinidad,
My Trinidad Calypso Joe"".

And she went back to from where she came;
And when she got there she heard with shame
That her Calypso Jo was dead!

When she heard that, she almost died,
She got a gun to try suicide!
But as she started to shoot, she cried,
""I think I'd rather live instead!"".

Judy Garland,"Voodoo, whisper low from above
Voodoo, what's this mystery called love?
Voodoo, folks keep tellin' me of
Love's allure, love's delight

June or January, noon or night
Voodoo, if this love's all that they say
Voodoo, for one favor I pray
Voodoo, won't you send it my way?

Judy Garland,"I was just lonely melisande,
Pity, pity me. 
Came a little wizard,
Waved his wand, 
Dreamed you up for me 

Now I feel a tingle
Each time I glimpse
Your face go dreaming by;
Proving the heart is quicker than the eye

When I look at you,
I hear lovly music, 
Can it be my heart that sings? 
When I look at you, 
I look at an angel,
Tell me where you've parked your wings

Dizzy me, silly moon 
Crazy quilt of a sky 
Are you real, or a dream
That got caught in my eye? 
When I look at you,
I, I'm looking at rainbows. 

Stars come tumbling down from above,
And I'm in love with you my love.",When I Look at You
Judy Garland,"Oh, my mother was frightened by a shotgun, they say
Thats why I'm such a wonderful shot.
I'd be out in the cactus and I'd practice all day,
And now tell me what have I got?

I'm quick on the trigger with targets not much bigger than a pinpoint
I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a celler, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
When I'm with a pistol, I sparkle like a crystal

Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun

If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle
You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder
And you can't shoot a male in the tail like a quail,

Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
I'm cool, brave, and daring to see a lion glaring
When I'm out with my Remington.
But a look from a mister will raise a fever blister

Oh you can't get a man with a gun
The gals with umbrellas are always out with fellers
In the rain or the blazin sun
But a man never trifles with gals who carry rifles

Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun.
A man's love is mighty, he'll even buy a nightie
For a gal who he thinks is fun.

But they don't buy pajamas for pistol packin mamas
And you can't get a hug from a mug, with a slug
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.",You Can't Get a Man With a Gun
Judy Garland,"You can hip, hip hurray
It was growing pop and it couldn't stop
Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Tom, Tom, the piper's son
He stole a tune and away he run
And away run he with that melody

Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he revamped it with a new off beat
And the classic thing got a shot of swing

Mr. Brahms cried, argh
So did Mozart and Bach
And to hear them rave
Paganini tumbled over in his grave

And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop and it couldn't stop
Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Tom, Tom, the piper's son
He stole a tune and away he run
And away run he with that melody

Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he vamped it with a boogie beat
And the classic thing got a shot of swing

Beethoven turned gray
So did Debussy and Bose
It was such a stew
Tchaikovsky said, ""I'm gonna sue""

And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade
It was growing pop and it couldn't stop
Now it's number one thanks to Tom the piper's son

Judy Garland,"People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about
Why don't they stop someday, address themselves this way?
Why are we here? Where are we going? It's time that we found out
We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh at it all

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
At eight each morning I have got a date
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State
You'll admit it's not the berries
In a building that's so tall
There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this
Life is just a bowl of, aw, nuts!
So live and laugh at it all!",Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries

Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for, I never really knew.
Finding your love, I found my adventure,
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights the star,

And someday I'll know that moment divine

Judy Garland,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

That never did come true?
