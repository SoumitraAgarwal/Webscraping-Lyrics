Junkhouse,"A big sun setting on the fields, I can't sleep on this tractor wheel
Put my seed into the earth, they never tell me just what it's worth
I'm praying for the rain, the open sky will seal my veins
When every farmer has made his grain, I'm praying for the rain, I'm still
Praying
The road was clear the night was too, and that's how I remember you
I hop a fence, I make my bed, but I can't make you leave my head
I'm praying for the rain, just to wash away this pain
Another headlight through my brain, I'm praying for the rain, I'm still
Praying
Now all my words have headed north, they rode a taxi or took a horse
The way I loved you was all in vain, I'm still praying for the rain 
I'm praying for the rain, beat the drum till I'm insane
Give the next dance craze a name, I'm praying for the rain, I'm still
Praying
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",Praying for the Rain
Junkhouse,"We live around the hydro towers
Listen to them singing in the park 
Wind our clock too tight
And all the radios are glowing in the dark 
Mothers lie down in the day time
And dream about Hollywood 
I know that they'd get there if they could 

[Chorus:]
It's just a matter of time
Before we get to shine 
It's not a question of when
Or who does the crime 

We show our skin through picture windows
Sit around cross legged on the floor 
Our living rooms electric, 
TVs, light bulbs, irons, cancer to the core 
Out in our back yards waiting
For women in flying saucers 
Under the stars and power lines 

[Chorus:]

The fans and the air conditioners
Runnin' in movie houses
The mother's not coming home again 

[Chorus:]",Shine

Junkie XL,"You've been living in a rot
And you can say you're not
But in case you forgot
You gotta give it your best shot

You've been bowin' on spots like metronome
Pack rat packs 'The Papers' like super gnome
Punch the clock in situations no win
Catch the weekdays past and next begins

Ambitions overrated, gets equated
With the freedom you'll be cravin', motivated than sedated
Feel like crackle doin' battle with the working cattle
The same shackle tackles the fellows, the pains, the marrow

Communities used once then destroyed
To many pawns, just to fill the void
Now you hit reflex real stallion
Blow steam like shining gold medallion

Scandalous, vandalous
Morals vanishing, chemicals refills
Sex kill, panting weekday
One wrecks the promise of 2001 violent

Junkie XL,"Mix it with mine, with yours
If the othordox ways crime
Ingnorance tricks the men
Sting again
Like porcupine
Skin complexion
Won't give direction
Hail to mulatto
Italiano
Farrago
Anything with a twist yo
For the night flows hot like sirocco
Mix with all for the ritual.
Win skin like Marlon Brando
In the last tango
Now I'm single
In the disco
Club schizo
When the disk spins loud colloyuial go.
Juices up
Loosen up
Let the lust overflows my cup pop.
Mix it with mine, blend it with yours.
Seeking a true force melange.
Never mind
Check the signs
Intertwine,
Cool: melange.
Ascetic aspects get no contact
Amatory looks for hot sex,
Screaming from your voice box, larynx
O yeah!
Steppin' to a girl that basically is way out of your league
Out of reach,
But the peach
Makes lips glisten,
Blushin' your cheeks,
Hold the courage and the guts
Aided by Millerquads or Buds
Alcohol creates the stud
To strut
In perfect duds
So much for phase one,
It takes one line to flake out son
As you glance
Top - bottom, butt
Gives the shakes on
Shoot the gift
For swift quick linguistic
Let libido uplift,
Arrange the melody
On the Freud theraphy tip
Figure you have potential,
She wetting lips.
It was a test,
Now your perfect match
'cause' the fire is lit.
Background unknown
But the sex drives the prone
Get the conversation on,
And dig out ones skulls to bone.

Junkie XL,"It's the conformist
Takin' the firm fist
Of the idealist
Taken the shitlist.
And now, the purist stays the purist
Till the shit hits the fan of the culprits
And then the lawyer
Will destroy a
Motivation to become the purist
And the terrorist
Is really fed up with.
Nothing strategic
To besiege with
And supremacists
Touch the surface
With their racist hatred. That glues eyelids.
Those with politics
All polite on tricks
Cripple the masses on the road to riches.

Why fight it,
Can't hide it.

Record needles showin' doses
With white Moses, party population

Peeps catch the beat, frantic pours pourin'
Strobe lights on, polygon
Hallucination gives you more than crazy moods
Stretch the grooves for the flock

No a-muck, super duper hi-tech rock
For the soft knock or hard knock
Down to few bucks, taxi cab aftershock
Follows the drug, marathon, strechtin' on

Standin' like ships on stones
Satiated, blatant, tainted
Now sanity shows holes

Sleep overcome the ones
That followed the god of fun
Honey buns with bums
Get the watchful eye stunned

Teens get me spirited
Exchangin' digits from sky pagers
To disco mania never sayin' to ya
The lust is major

Catch the brothers on the rebound
With skins on the skeez route
Those with wheels, fleshy feels
Surely got clout, what it's all about?

Stretchin' the funky addiction
Line to line, minds unwind
With the cocaine dissolution
Syringe tricks the kick in private seclusion

Chase the rush, it was tough to loose
The kaleidoscopic illusion
Stretch the limit, kill the cynic
In the human shell

Junkie XL,"No need for confetti bombs
Or phallus symbols
To be obnoxious, outrageous
But the sound will be very contagious
Like nuclear fallout radius

No need for bands with tight Spandex
Macho flex, high voices from Larynex
Tight jockstraps stuffed with socks
With walnuts to show sex
But plain, obscure, high tech

Or boys that play so crude
Or smokers obsessed on weed
To be hardcore with fatigues

That is the Junkie beats that grim reap
And shuffle the feet and put all asleep
In front of their MTV screens sweep
Lost souls are in deep
In their trash cash, middle class heap

Junkie XL,"Connecting channel to channel, communications are rebel
That we're looking for harmony like the bass and the treble
Divide it like pebble hallucinating battles
But we can't saddle separate the hassling tattle

Hope can strangle, mangled to confused and
Believe with the strength of Rosicrucians
Searching for human touch trust will be loving such
Musical solution, simple revolution beats and pulses

Our frek will reminisce quest for better pet
No, it sounds really bad wagoness
We get, the sweat my only methaphoreman
Let this cats only live for heavier sex

Chemical surfin' and ol' daddy seemed killed
Yesterday struggle success will predict a meatness
The violent we stand, united we fall

Junkie XL,"She was born fat to believe to be wed
Is a blessing with doubt without believe
Matrimony, so phony
Her up bringing real gloomy
Like a church mouth to his pouch
Before filling a duty
Counting out to all around
Left room shadow
When thoughts about pout
Outlays with sulk
In disgust she's filled with void
She said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Rings are gold and funds are mould
The story turns all to inconsistent, so bold
Now rise and unfold
All awhile I focus in the fiftieth mid
Wrapped to a person that could
Only be my dad
Mom's bliss's a chocolate but
Versus regret
She said, she said 

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

The girls next door
Slaves to explore
Gets more than she's looking for
Adventure k.o. no quid pro quo's
Gonna make her feel down and low
What a faint make up
(It's) Hard to keep the face up
Many partners come and go
Before she wakes up
Those who stay
Make it tempo-free
Made a wish she said
If you buy yesterday
Who's faster, faster each day
And I stay on her finest array
Then I heard her say
I heard her say

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Talked to the one who had no fun
From the day of their own prom
Hide behind quibbler lunch
Heard the one of great importance

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind

Zerotonine, I'm in line, to feel fine
Everything else, makes me blind",Zerotonine

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again

I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say

We could have lived this dance forever

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
The way he described it he said,
""You'd be better off dead than alive.""
I didn't listen to his jive.
I knew all along he was all wrong,
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
He said I need treatment.
But I'm not that easily led.
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind.
And he thought I was nuts.
No more if's or and's or but's.
Oh, no.

They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas.
But I knew what was happenin',
I knew I was a genius.
What's so strange when you know that
You're a wizard at three?
I said, ""Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me.""

I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.
But I had saw some crazy things
Before I came to.
Now, do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.

They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,
They all laughed at Edison,
And also at Einstein.
So why should I feel sorry if they just
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic
That went on in my head.
I had a brain, it was insane.
So I just let them laugh at me
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top.
Aaaaaaah.

""Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?""

Badada, badada, badada. Wo!

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
But I said, ""Doctor,
I think that it's you instead.
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.
And you know two heads are better than one.""

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,

Was man wissen muss in den Ohren.
Irgendwer schreibt grad dein Leben auf.

Wer zu uns gehört auf den Bildern,
Was uns stört im Netz.
Lasst uns daran wachsen oder platzen:
Uns schreibt wer das Leben vor
Modern life is war

Was wir gerne wären
Was wir gerne wären

Kannst du's mir zeigen?
Das „Selbstverständlich Schweigen“
Das „Leben Schütteln es nicht mehr heult?“
Und dann die Ruhe überstehen.
Wir haben uns wohl selbst verlernt.
Vielleicht sind wir schon längst glücklich
Und es fehlt nur jemand, der es uns erklärt.

Frag die andern, Glück kann man kaufen.
Frag die andern, Glück macht schön..
Sag den andern schnell wo dein Glück ist.
Irgendwer liest grad dein Leben mit.

Frag die andern: früher war's besser.
Und bald wird alles gut
Und wir stehen dazwischen, on a mission.
Keiner schreibt ins Leben rein,
Wir können zufrieden sein

Was wir gerne wären
Was wir gerne wären

Kannst du's mir zeigen?
Das „Selbstverständlich Schweigen“
Das „Leben Schütteln es nicht mehr heult?“
Und dann die Ruhe überstehen.
Wir haben uns wohl selbst verlernt
Vielleicht sind wir schon längst glücklich
Und es fehlt nur jemand, der es uns erklärt

Ich hab die Schnauze voll (Das ist das Gegenteil von Allem)
Und krieg das Maul nicht auf (Ich will hier nur noch raus)
Würd' echt kein Wunder sein (Denn ich weiß)
Wenn ich an Wut ersauf' 
(dass ich sonst an Wut ersauf', dass ich sonst an Wut ersauf')

Kannst du's mir zeigen?
Das „Selbstverständlich Schweigen“
Das „Leben Schütteln es nicht mehr heult?“
Und dann die Ruhe überstehen.
Wir haben uns wohl selbst verlernt
Vielleicht sind wir schon längst glücklich
Und es fehlt nur jemand, der es uns erklärt",Glücklich (wir müssen üben)
Jupiter Jones,"Vergessen zu vermissen. Mal im Ernst wer kann das schon? 
Trag den Kopf in all den Wolken und die Füße im Beton.
Was ich bräucht' wär ein zu Hause, sowas ähnliches wie Glück. 
Es gibt für beides einen Ort „zurück“
Wir leisten uns Geschichten,die nie weitergehen, 
Weil wir in Ländern waren und uns alles endlos schien. 
Wir wissen nicht wohin. 
Wir gönnen uns ein Leben das zum Sterben ist.
Sterbenselend, sterbenstraurig, sterbensalbern ist.
Wohin?

Und in Hunderttausend Betten,
Hinter hunderttausend Wänden, 
Küssen hunderttausend Mädchen, 
Hunderttausend Typen wach.
Und es wär' mir egal,wenn nicht eine davon du wärst.
Oh, es wär' mir egal.

All die Filme, all die Lieder, alle sprechen über dich.
Sie erzählen mir, dass es gut wird. 
Wie das geht,erklären sie nicht. 
Und nur kurz bevor ich's einseh',nur ein winzig kleines Stück, 
Da ist und bleibt das eine Wort „zurück“

Wir leisten uns Geschichten, die weitergehen,

In hunderttausend langen Nächten,
Halten hunderttausend Zweifel

Oh, es wär' mir egal.
Oh, es wär' mir egal.",Hunderttausend Typen wach
Jupiter Jones,"Überhaupt, was heißt schon „kennen“ in einer Welt voll Variablen?
Wo kommt Ruhe her, wenn alles sich bewegt?
Und die Selbstverständlichkeit, fühlt sich heut wieder besonders
Und der gottverdammte Grundsatz hat's sich anders überlegt
Dein ""Home from Home“ ein fremder Freund, zu sehr gewollt ums zu bereuen

Furchtbar günstig abzugeben
Halbes, kaum genutztes Leben
Fünfzig Teile Einsicht und ein tristes Firmament
Tragisch traurig einzusehen
All das Klagen, all das Wehen
Reichen für 'ne Faust voll bitterer Pillen und ein Kissen aus Zement

Ob du wirklich richtig lebst, siehst Du, wenn das Licht ausgeht
Doch Du hast Angst im Dunkeln und schlimmer noch davor
Eine Frage des Vertrauens macht noch lange keine Antwort
Und nicht jeder schreckverzerrte Mund trifft gleich auf offene Ohren!
Lass uns mal was klarstellen, mit mir ist überhaupt nichts los

Ich glaub nicht mehr an vieles, doch ich glaube an den Trost
Ich überlass' ihn halt den Tröstern",Momentaufnahme 3 (Schrödingers Dilemma)
Jupiter Jones,"Man spricht ja nicht über Gefühle
Höchstens mit Ärzten und so
Man lässt ja nicht jeden gern wissen wohin der Puls rast und wieso
Und Liebe kommt schwer über Lippen
Die Angst ham' vor Kitsch oder Zeit
Die sich schon längst geschworen haben wir fangen woanders an
Wenn nichts mehr weiter geht fangen wir woanders an

Wir können rennen
Wir dürfen stolpern
Man hat's noch nicht verloren nur wenn man's vermisst
Lasst uns verstehen und uns erinnern
Für immer reicht genau von hier zum Grund wo man vergisst
Was gut gewesen ist

Wir waren mal Hals über Kopf
Und furchtlos und selten und gut
Ich frag mich oft ob wirs nur lassen
Weil jeder das irgendwann tut
Ich würd' dir so gern was versprechen
Sowas wie ""alles wird heil""
Wenn wir uns einfach schwören können wir fangen von vorne an
Für alles das was zählt fangen wir von vorne an

Wir können rennen
Wir dürfen stolpern
Man hat's noch nicht verloren nur wenn man's vermisst
Lasst uns verstehen und uns erinnern
Für immer reicht genau von hier zum Grund wo man vergisst

Jupiter Jones,"Ich bin ein ziemlicher Idiot, darüber lässt sich's wohl nicht streiten.
Krieg' mich selber grad' so hin, in den allerbesten Zeiten.
Und wenn ich etwas gelernt hab, dann das Stille mich verstört. 
Vielleicht ist das genau der Grund, warum ich sie so selten hör'.
Deshalb hat sie mich erschreckt, 
ja sie hat mich überfordert, saß so plötzlich mit am Tisch, 
Mit dem allerletzten Wort, dass ja eigentlich mir gehört.
Sie hat nervös an mir gezerrt, 
hat mich aus dem Haus gezogen und von außen zugesperrt.

Hier kommt die Erleuchtung, 
auf dem U-Bahn-Sitz und das ganze Leben, wird zum Treppenwitz.
Ich wollt bloß sagen, ich wollt bloß sagen, dass ich dich vermiss'.

Ich bin ein Meister im Verstehen und ich nutz die schönsten Wörter.
Hör' mir selbst am Liebsten zu, wenn ich stundenlang erörter'.

Nur die Krux an der Geschichte, dieses Mal hat's nichts gebracht, 
Denn der Sinn hat mich erschlagen, umgedreht und stumm gemacht. 
Was am allernächsten lag, diese eine kleine Zeile, die gesagt 
Und dann verloren und das schon länger,als die längste Weile.

Jetzt steht's direkt vor mir,starrt mich an und lacht mich aus. 
Viel Worte,Angst und tausend Fragen war der allerschlimmste Tausch.

Hier kommt die Erleuchtung, auf dem U-Bahn-Sitz

Jupiter Jones,"Ich Huckleberry und du Tom, 
Unser Dorfteich war das Mississippi-Delta.
Und jeden Tag Revolution, Geheimgespräch am Dosentelefon.
Paar Jahre drauf am selben Ort, die Haare bunt, das Herz im Bauch, die Angst auf Halbmast.
Der erste Rausch,der erste Kuss und keiner fragte,wann das aufhören muss.

Und ich weiß noch,statt der Tränen,
Lief uns Zuckerwasser über's Gesicht.
Wir waren das Gegenteil von traurig.
Wir übten den geheimen Handschlag 
Und egal wie's lief, wir blieben in Sicht.
Das war wie „Kitt komm schnell,ich brauch' dich!“

Wir haben uns jeden Tag gesagt 
„Verlier die Jugend bloß nicht beim Erwachsenwerden.“
Weil das schon von allein passiert
Wachst auf und weißt „Ab jetzt wird's kompliziert!“
Ich bin nicht gern sentimental, 
Mir fällt schwer zu sagen „Früher war es besser!“
Ich weiß genau,dass das
Nicht stimmt,solang wir Tom und Huckleberry sind.

Und ich weiß noch,statt der Tränen,
Lief uns Zuckerwasser über's Gesicht.
Wir waren das Gegenteil von traurig.

Jupiter Jones,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

Jupiter One,"A light on a platform
Perfume of a secret
The sound of scissors
And a girl with a faint smile

Moaning like a brick wall
As she merges on the highway
Could she be a doctor
Or a light on a platform

Everyday I start new
In the mask of the afternoon
My history forgotten
In the bottom of the ocean
In the light of the platform moon

I grew up by the highway
She grew up by the sea
She hears her name in the sound of the waves
But the ships hold a message for me

I was born by the highway
She's got sand in her hair
The lonely sounds of the traffic in the night
Will never reach her there

Woke up on a black beach
With a face I didn't recognize
My history forgotten
In the bottom of the ocean

Everyday I start new
Broken mast and abandoned crew
Her mystery is rotting
In the bottom of the ocean
In the light of the platform moon

See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl 
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end 
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl 

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Jupiter Rising,"You call me up about 2 in the morning
You say ""I know it's late but can I see you?""
Somethings been on your mind
You're saying that I hide behind 
A wall I'm frontin
And you just want to get through
But what happens when the honeymoon ends
Then you take back all the promises spoken, spoken
But I want to love you I got a wall to breakthrough
And then you leave I'm in too deep to surface again
But what happens when the honeymoon ends

I wanna let you in but I'm so guarded
Cause in the past I've been so brokenhearted
It's up to me to get this lovin' started
I'm guarded so guarded
You say to trust and that I must believe you
How will I know that you will always be true
Cause in the past I've been so brokenhearted
I'm guarded so guarded

It's like a game of cards I use to gamble
I played all or nothing and I kept losing
You said you don't play catch me and then walk away
No more crying and lying and misusing
But what happens when the honeymoon ends
And then you leave I'm in too deep to surface again
But what happens when the honeymoon ends

I wanna let you in but I'm so guarded
Cause in the past I've been so brokenhearted
It's up to me to get this lovin' started
I'm guarded so guarded
How will I know that you will always be true

Between the sheets at night
I feel so secure
Trusting you'll never leave
How can I be sure?

I'm so guarded

Jupiter Rising,"Oh I loved you boy but I?m like a boomerang 
I fly away and swing back I don?t mean what I say 
You have enough of all the pushing pull and fighting yeah baby I?m a mess I know I can not hide it 
But it?s too late when you picking up your phone 
It's just the way by telling me I need too be alone is there another girl sleeping by your side I can not bare don't wanna know I?d rather go blind....


(Chorus)
Do you really wanna love me? 
All you wanna do is make me cry
I love you over and over again
I love you over and over again 
Do you really wanna love me? 
All you wanna do is make me cry 
I love you over and over again 
I love you over and over again 

I hate you I love you I can't make up my mind
I need you I want you. You make me cry all the time
What?s the deal with me I know I should know better?
It?s not a fairytale ending happy ending together
I tell my self I got to pull myself through this
Just handle it all push all the pain to me and move it 
You were the love of my life not just a memory getting back together that?s just what I wish for thinking.....

(Chorus)

Do you really wanna love me 
All you wanna do is make me cry
I love you over and over again
I love you over and over again 
Do you really wanna love me? 
All you wanna do is make me cry 
I loved you over and over again 
I love you over and over again


Please hold it back girl we all up in the public
She turned around and grabbed my shirt I swear she lost it 
I?d tried to calm her down 
I?d tried to keep her posted it
She kept on screaming man I loved you the mostest
She looking at me like the way that I should really feel 
And I can?t testify cause I ain't got a really feel
But if you ask me to girl 
Let's make it a deal 
So let?s just get the cash and headed for the hills

Do you really wanna love me (love me)
All you wanna do is make me cry (make me cry)

Jupiter Rising,"Ohh ohh ohh...

It's just a tragic story about a young girl
I wanna tell you how she fell

Hollywood girl
Picture in a crowed place
Such a beautiful world
Perfect body with a perfect face

She wanted more yes, she had a dream
She had to be the star on the magazine
She took a turn for the worst
To satisfy her needs. Oh yeah

Chorus
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

She signed to a model agency
Said you gotta to get lean
So she worked out her heart and didn?t eat anything
She took her pills, her alcohol
Numbing her mind and feeling nothing at all... But

She wanted more yes, she had a dream
She had to be the star on a magazine
She took a turn for the worst
To satisfy needs
Oh baby what does that mean


Chorus [x2]
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

Warning like the room was spinning out of control
To the deep into a demon she was loosing her soul
Her body too thin to pick herself off the floor
They rushed her to emergency
Thank God they gotta her before

It was over in vain in the name of fame
She will never be the same
And the time for a change
She said save me (save me)
Oh ohh... I'm sinking (sinking)
In the quicksand

Chorus [x2]
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

She keeps on slippin'
Constantly trippin'
Always seems to be grippin'
On that quick (quick) sand

Do you think that maybe we could be lovers once in a while?

I am never here and it's impossible to heal
Go ahead and understand me underneath this killer blue sky
Go ahead and understand me please.

Kaye, are you even real?
Do you think we'll ever figure it out, I'm running out of hope
Say anything you feel
Maybe you can do it for the both of us and I'll untie the rope

Kaye, out there in the world I am full of their hate, their crime
In here we are both light and pure of heart
Out there in the world I am left for dead don't help me
In here it's like we can be pure of heart.

It's hard enough to breathe right here, let alone be right here, let alone here you say, ""love.""
It's hard enough trying to be strong right now
I try to be wrong right now
I try to be anything that doesn't scare her away.

Do you think that maybe we could just stay here?",Kaye
Jupiter Sunrise,"I can barely see you - I can barely feel you - your fading like the dirt on my TV
I'm feeling kind of scared cause I never get to talk but there's really nothing good for me to say
You're right to stay away - you're dangerous to me
You push so cleverly just like no others
You don't like other girls - you care about your friends - and you'd rather have been born as one of your brothers

Suddenly I am ""the wrong""
Suddenly I can't be strong
Suddenly I am the man I never meant to be.

I barely know your name I barely know your name even though we have been living here for years
I'd really like to talk but they took away my tongue and replaced it with a thousand lonely tears
I'm sorry about your dad I wish he wasn't mean
I really wish I didn't remind you of him
I try my very best but the devil owns my mind and I haven't had the chance to show you who I am.

Won't you have another cup of tea?
I really have enjoyed our time together
And when I get on back to the prison, will you
Wait for me?

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Juraj Bartos,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Juraj Bartos,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?","How Long Has This Been Going On?, song (from Rosalie, musical)"

Seven deadly sins 
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of chins 
The all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones 
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone 
Its the call of the wild that's why my words rank high 
Drop the verse for nine planets 
That fell from the sky 
Do or die you and I get fly with rap expressions 
With the one two three four five 

In the session with the lesson 
Cause in bass and treble we trust 
With the rebels orally ready in case we bust 
And write a power chord and if the place be plush 
We kick the old school like Julio Iglesias 
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch 
We attack like a bullet till your face relax 
And think about it 
If you ain't got the class to flee 
Be mentally ready for jurass-catastrophy 

Now its time for me to rise 
The lyric utilizer 
Down like fertilizer 
Quick to improvise 
A style that can surprise ya 
Your eyes is on the prize 
We can go line for line 
I ain't hard to find 
While we break your spine 
My mild style reclines 
I'm laid back 
All that talk you need to save that 
The payback is all the reason that I'm flexing 
The feds rocking like we X-Men

You say you want action satisfaction 
The brothers with the positive reaction 
The crew with style that's on top of the pile 
J5's gonna rock a long long while 

We get set 
Who's up next to pull to a fast one 
Lyrically connect the dots and then I blast one 
Now who wants action satisfaction 
Lyrics remind you of bass I'm everlasting 
Casting plagues my styles crossing the switchblades 
My momma shoulda named me Grace cause I'm amazingly 
Blazing with the fire and desire 
I'm world renowned I gets down to the wire 

If any child of mine gets out a line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion 
Lifted out like vine motion I spend time stroking 
You still drink a dime potion and dime boasting 
But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality 
We be giving power that you can share with your family 
Aerodynamically cutting through danger 
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor 

[Chorus:Repeat x2] 

The moral of my oral ammunition rendition 
Tuna fish on a Marc seven collision 
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's 
And the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised 
I see through your crews like an x-ray tube 
And gamma rayed your function 
Left you with assumption 
That we be the butter clique 
We smothered with the action satisfaction that's guaranteed to be Jurassic

To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel 
Its not about the bills 
That's not keeping it real 
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals 
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse 
'Cause it's the hundred watt blood shot game of death

Okay, let's begin

Compound, a substance composed
Of two or more elements
Chemically combined
In definite proportions by weight

Mixtures, two or more substances
That are not chemically united such as air
Solution, a uniform mixture of varying proportions
Of a solvent and a solute

For many of our students
This is the lesson you've been waiting for

Sodium, Na plus one
Magnesium, Mg plus two

Aluminum, Al plus three
Potassium, K plus one
Calcium, Ca plus two
Chromium, Cr plus two, three, six

Any physical difficulty
With a record or a turntable
Is taken care of

And Frank Sinatra would go together?
Edit, no combinations of music

You're about to play a soul, 45 rpm recording
But the turntable is set at 33 and 1/3
And the record plays very slowly
Let's pick up the tempo a bit, eh?

Now, let us imagine
That you are in the middle
Of your disk jockey program
This is the mark of a professional

Yeah, if you could throw a couple yeah, uuh
Right, when he's playin' the drum, you know
Let him play a couple beats alone, euh

Uh, oh, I'm sorry I had the turntable at the wrong speed

The composition of the molecules of a substance
New substances with new properties are produced

Jurassic 5,"Now I'm a say this one time boy and that's my word
We rockin' shots and not fire through the Hindenburg
The contribution is clear 
You add water to bone
And get the Jurassic 5 on the microphone
Now if you like the tone
And how the harmony's done
And the sucka emcees die before they've begun
Well I'd like to know if
You've got the notion
'Cause we're number one
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours
I'm just on some other s***
I'm all about the beats and the lyrics
So when you hear it you can feel it
The vibe is energized by the presence of my spirit
No interference we persevere 
The purpose is clear
We're here to leave your ear hurtin' severe
You're lurking in fear
'Cause we take it back like robbin' laxly
Rockin' from country sides to spots where hard rocks be
I often wonder if these emcees even know how it feels
To dedicate they whole life to this mic of steel
It's not about the bills
That's not keeping it real
A lot of tight rappers out here ain't got no deals
We appeal to the brothers with flow finesse
'Cause it's the hundred watt blood shot game of death
'Cause we're protected by the covenant of words and beats
Rewind and feel the heat
Recline and take a seat

Now I walk from Tanzania
Earthquake Transylvania
And on my way I kicked a whole through the wall of China
Just to get the right blend
'Cause its schizophrenic of the pathway to livin'
I fell into the deep end
You shouldn't have told me
The pyramids can hold me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your beats pull out your cuts
Give us a mic, what up
And we goin' tear s*** up
I'm on some old and forgotten
Sun up to sun down

The nutty professor science droppin'
Rockin' Robbin's hood

Hey, I'm 2na-Fish from you-N-I-T-why
Do or die
Anti-Illuminati, why 
Do the liquid from my vocals 
Make the ghetto start swimming
Forever winning I'm in it 
Like Meadowlark Lemon
I get goose bumps
When the baseline thumps
A sucka emcee freestyle
He had mine for lunch
Marc 7even get you open like an attach'
Briefcase in this case
The victor is no way
Ah, ah the tool spinners
Cooking the full dinner
Killing the first born of lyrical Yul Brenner's
When is it the academy 
Rattling your anatomy
That'll be J 5 so kill all of your fake flattery
That'll be the day
When labels pay our way
2na what you say
When emcees come to play 
Man he dead

Preparing your intellect before your final nap

I'll f*** around and arrest your whole development

When it comes to digital display
I'm ready for the world while you earl off the Tanqueray
Tactics, my s***s Jurassic 5
Fingers of death while you exhale and inhale
With a deep breath with my Chop-Sui style

I gets mines to the death
'Cause I be cookin'

Your s***s annoying like fat-a** Book man
On Good Times
When I rhyme
I hit the designated area 
I hope you got your shots cause this is lyrical malaria
Spreading, beheading fools with the punishment
I live in America but f*** this government
A hundred and fifty times over silk with lead
While y'all drink the similack 
My rhymes are breast-fed
No artificial nipples
I flip the real skills
I thought I told you once 
I kick the lyrical windmills
And backspin Benedict 
Strictly for my benefit

Yo, either you a part of the problem
Or part of the solution
What's your contribution to life
So many people complain, always talk about change yo
But what's your contribution to life
Either you with or ain't with it, if it ain't broke don't fix it
Yo what's your contribution to life
Either you give or you take, make moves and you wait yo
But what's your contribution to life

Your about to witness three of the most common 
Tales of man, woman and human, the difference between the three
Is that there is not difference, just other outcomes
Listen and witness the common tales

Aye yo my momma and a nigga for life
Love carousel, cuss yell and fight
Seven nights a week, no respect when they speak
Disrespect between the sheets, the ends don't meet
No rice beans or meat
My momma was the bread winner plus
She had to cook his dinner
My daddy was a full time sinner
Poppa was a stoner stay gone till November
Off of that, gawk?, that made emack
Like the devil done took his soul and ain't given it back
Remember that, when you play for the bless
Speedy victory for the poor and the press 
I can't stand the stress, its test and time press
Up against my momma and daddy chest, I try and rest
With no stretch of the mind, I can't find no piece
Of mind within this family of mine, yo

[Marc 7even]
She got chips and you don't, that's bottom line
That's just the way love goes, lets rewind 
You really ain't paid, you clocking minimum wage
Now basically you a slave, your wife studies for days
No money for much, just movies and such
The way your two hands clutch, you know its love not lust
Now she's sick of the bus, and using you as a crutch
And on top of this stuff, she graduates in a month
Damn, her new job got her clocking the dough
Now she's buying new clothes, and taken you to the show
You feeling like you the ho, not knowing which way to go
And ultimately you know, you ain't feeling her so
You need to get up, get out and get something
Your job ain't nothing, all these years you've just been frontin
That's the way she played ya, the talked in rager went back
To your days of

[Chali 2na]
She always said I'm out husslin for food, kitchen indeed
While this nigga spend his ends on booze, bitches and weed
I thought that we'd agree, with two kids to feed
That you would slow your own, but instead of switching your seed
You slapped me, you can't attack me thinking I'm be happy
In fact its a packing and we rapidly
After we witness, no love between parents
The father type that was once on the sense vanished
Supreme bamish the couples that match these
Producing generations of kids with latched keys
Her daughter learned from momma
How to reject men, her sons attracts women
That don't respect men, and then
One parental provided can be the plan
But no woman can truly teach a boy to be a man
That's why I'm always telling these many pals of mine
The most that you can spend on any child is time

Look we don't have all the answers, we're victims also
To the same situations, but man, plans and the lord plans
And the lord is the best of planners, 
So what's your contribution to life

I said shut up!
Now are you ready to play the game?
No!
Are you ready to play the game?
Yeah!

The Game
Playing to survive
Aiming to win anyway they can

Yo, yo
Pass the ball, final casting call
First of all, verbal basketball
Off the glass, smash your jaw
Too fast for y'all
You might take a nasty fall
Trying to stick with the prehistoric passenger
(Foul Ball)
All breath, no physical contact
Bounce back, demonstrate invincible bomb raps
Not no hustler no player or speakin no crime crap
I'm vocally trying to score before my time lapse

Uh! Full court press, hands in your chest
Runnin' cause I'm a rebel with the ghetto 
No fouls just checks, make a brother sweat
Word for y'all to earn my reject
Get it out of here, attack from the rear
Y'all niggas ain't nothing but some bitch ass queers
I'll be in your ear, increase the fear
Ripping with the shears as the crowd just cheers

Bring on the opposition
Cause my position is to shut you down
As the basketball pounds on the concrete floor
Envisioning moves to freak brothers every which way
Dominating like Doc J.
Pass me the rock, I know just what to do with it
It's real vivid, I pivot, through the lane
Three hundred and sixty behind my back
I take your monkey ass to the rack like Jerry Stack

I'm saw by most recruiters and heavily recommended
Sticking your best shooters they lower verbal percentage
It's taking its toll, 24-second clock control
Stopping this obstacle, impossible
I was the number one ? project in the city
Prospect, now that's something that you can believe
So be it, whether pro or collegiate, the hit but don't miss
Prime time the offense, switch

Y'all can't ball, y'all can't ball
Yo ref, where's the tech? Man, make the call
The game is getting tight verbal victories in sight
What counts is what you write not concerned about the hype
My rhymes go baseline so why you trying to take mine?
Last man tried just died inside the paint line
I bank rhymes, got a call so I flex
I'm on the foul line with a few verses left
When my flow hits the net, the next brother flex

I put my foot in the pavement
With the brothers I'm raised with
Play with and break dance back in the days with
And still in the game with 12 points, 4 assists
Get up in the game, in your face like swish
Crash the boards with metaphors
In the air like a concord
Hey yo what you out for?
Yo I'm out for the whole score
22 flat seconds for me to win
I can't win for losing with this cheating ass ref

My squad's supreme
So I don't need Clyde or the dream
Next time you play the game boy pick a better team
Your choice is short when you on a concrete court
But my mental cohorts is bout to change the whole sport
Give me the pill boy, crossover with the skills
Wrap around pass, fly right past your grill
Take off from half court, in some J5 shorts
The rap band with the man when my words play sports
Comin' through your lane, with pure skills so stand clear
Vocal charge is a mirage, I still stand here
Damn near, make your shit look soft like Pam Grier
Fans cheer for the paragraph Bill Lambier

Show me the rock, so I can show these fool what I got
(He's heating up) Fuck that, I'm flaming hot
Verbally take you to the blacktop, and wreck shop
Turn my game up a notch, pass me the rock
1 on 1, 3 on 3, 5 on 5, horse, 21
It really don't matter cause son you'll still get done
Yo you should know better than try to barter with this globetrotter
Militious, vicious dunks, I'm Vince Carter
And it's the high draft pick, flashing it
Still can penetrate and slightly overweight
But whatever it takes my shot can elevate

The past depart the present cause the future is near
Anticipation, magnified my motivation
Direct my energy to touch nations
Been entertaining since niggas was really banging
Dancing at the old folks parties, pancaking
I've been waiting for my time to shine

From ??? to rocking at the Good Life

Yo, whether you love to hate it, if it's in or outdated
If I've been overrated or maybe your most favorite
You expect me still to write my verse on time
And I expect you not to front when you hear my rhyme
Don't expect me to smile cause it's in good taste
I know cats that's no mistake smiling in my face
And don't expect to try and guess if I'm mad or not
Or if I'm cold or hot, you would know if not
And don't expect me to come and just bite my tongue
It's kind of hard to forget what some brothers have done
But my mother always said you can forgive and forget
And expect that most promises won't be kept
I guess I gave credit where it wasn't deserved
To brothers must have preferred to not keep their word
The bigger the burden, the bigger the uncertain

And the evil that men do that live life close to kings

The smog covers the city like a table cloth
Is it fame at fault? Entertainers labeled soft
The place where people come to lose their train of thought

Despite the claims of what LA is and what it ain't
The picture the city paints that over exaggerates
Within the circus, if you're filling this service purpose
Some feel it ain't worth it, the city that's got you nervous
And make you injure, and get up out of here nigga
Cause LA never considered for those that need baby sitters
This is the hot bed for singles and newlyweds
Some looking for better gigs or fiending to make it big
It's the only place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn
Out, by any place regardless of the cost

I'm gonna tell you what my crew is all about
We like raw rhythm fusion, real rhyme producin'
Songs for the world's men, women and children
Armed and equipped with much confidence
And this is how we're gonna make our living
Some are known for bein' biters
Non-creative and wack rhyme-writers
Yo, they soup you up but can't rock the jam
Known to the world as a one-hit band
Easy come, easy go, yo you had your turn
Temporary niggas touchin' up your perm
You see a rapper is a kid that brags and acts big
A rhymer is a nigga that can handle his biz
Yo, A rapper is a kid that's tryin' to be the shit
An entertainer ain't tryin' cause he already is

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where life imitate art and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

We was rocking a jam the other night
J5 was on the mic so the people was hype
Yo, we like to rock the party with adrenalin and passion
The crowd started screaming ""Action Satisfaction""
Numark dropped the beat and the heat from the fire
We brought the energy and streetcar named desire

We was flipping, they was tripping, how we was old schoolin'
Needle to the groove, hands in the air movin'
And we said to the crowd ""This is the place to be,
Whether you paid a fee or you got in free""

So when you step through the door, the music gets loud
Maneuver through the crowd to get a better view now

To be an MC, you got to be so fresh
To have style and finesse way above the rest
With the strong delivery, vocal chemistry
Street poetry in tune with the beat
So if you think you got the skills come take a test
Microphone check if you truly are blessed
If you can flow like water and can comprehend
You need longevity in this game to win
Now if you want to be the best you got to move and motivate
Watch the money that you make in the industry stakes

Cause some of these people ain't got no class
And some of these folks'll make you beat they ass
If you can believe then you can achieve
Get the loot, live the dream, be on top of the scene
To keep the people in it, and accumulate fans
To be dope in the studio and slam at the jams, so

Welcome party people, while we got your attention
There's a few things we'd like to mention
The name is Jurassic, but they call us J5
We rock bonafide fly rhymes fortified
We got 2 DJs controlling the beat and
Vocal harmonies make it sound so sweet
We're the four horsemen, with words to caution
Expressed and flipped in an orderly fashion
With the rhymin', designin' the music on time and
The fellas saying ""ho"" and the ladies losin' they mind and
The breakin', the scratchin', this thing called rappin'
The cultivated music that keeps your hands clappin
The passion, reaction, the street satisfaction

The rhythm, the spirit, you love it when you hear it

The contribution to showbiz, mixed with entertainment
Resurrected rhymes, not the same old same
Now if you like what we came with
And you feel you can sang wit it
Peep the verbal language and the way we arranged it
Now entertainment to make the people applaud
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours

I'm from the graduating class of one-nine-eight-eight
L.A. Unified School M A H
A gangbanger from the streets taught me how to break
In South Central L.A., ay yo, can you relate?

I'm Chali 2na
The one who puff the buddha keep the Snapple in the cooler
Used to go to junior high with Son Doola
Old skoola - a permanent, element, in ya tournament
Tellin it prevalent never delicate when we burnin it

Now from L.A. to the U.K. we attempt to rock a party
The rhyme and the music you don't hear that no more hardly
I can say it's partly, all our faults smarty
J5'll bring you more than the shakin of a body

Ay yo a child is born but no state of mind
But when I first heard it, put words to rhymes
I went from hypercars, to powder blue All-Stars
To hangin on monkey bars catchin spiders in jelly jars

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
So uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats with real live MC's
Playground tactics, no rabbit-in-a-hat tricks
Just that classic, rappin from Jurassic

I bring the noise plus the funk, entertainin like a dunk
From a snotty-nosed prima donna millionaire punk
But uh, I heard a hunch, that somebody might munch
Cause J5 go together just like parties and spiked punch
Your crew's captain crunch, and I'm the seven seas
Bombin on MC's, crushin crews with ease
Brother please you know my steez is 100 degrees
With no era bring it live like the Trio of Terror

Trio of Terror no mascara, at last your brass surpass pleasure
We the last treasure set to entice the cash bearer
Mask wearers who bite my reflection like glass mirrors
Be trash pickers who need to consider the past clearer

Now what you thought was old and out of date
We brought it back alive and changed the shape
We put it on wax for those who think that
The 5 we energize has been extinct

[Chorus]

We takin it back like battles in hallways and bathrooms
And battles in the back of the classroom
And in the bungalows game of death with flows
Lunchtime rhymes you had to prove and show

Never the school type, couldn't pronounce the words right
The class jester, I was flunkin every semester
The summer hit, had it burnin in '86
Class cuttin and runnin wit all the neighborhood derelicts

Within the concrete jungle [huh!] we remain humble
Akil and Akir, bounce, flip and tumble
Uh, we never fumble, break down or stumble
Hot mumbo jumbo, just bring it when we rumble

We push it like the Daytona
Fresh rhymes we blaze on yas
Strictly from California old skool public diplomas
We spittin from every corner we flippin it when we wanna
Beneath the concrete be street word on ya

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
Where women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts
On thin strips of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction,
Eruption of passion corrupts it
Life lasting friendships involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

CHORUS (Akil)
We've been friends for a long time
A very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine
But respect the thin line
Love you like you was mine
Think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine
But respect the thin line

Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of ya'll
So you respect that
And entertain an idea but get brought
Back to reality
And could you really live with that
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep it distant
Hug and kiss the friendship

MARC 7
An ongoing friendship
We was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked a sentence

Too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships work
But, from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone
The way we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted
Infatuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want just a touch

CHORUS

NELLY
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turned into love
On some weak tip
See I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling
You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing
Hell, if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room

Yo, this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first
And then slip

If you only knew that
Once you cross ain't no turning back

Jeopardizing kinship

Inescapable whatever we aim at

We fully capable
Make no mistake if we
Break a few rules
Make a few moves
And drop a few jewels
On top of your views

To Rakaa few crews
You gotta confuse
Melodically
Use rap to sonically bruise cats
Harmonies move over
Chemically glued tracks the ripper

We have to rock
Ain't that much time on the clock
Kick rocks
Keep it movin' now pick up the pace
We drop and hit the ground runnin'
Winnin' the race
With limited space and limited papes
At any rate we take your mind
To the realest of states

We blow yo mind
With vocal rhyme
And music from my DJ in the back
Gon' shine

Use what Allah give me
Flip it if y'all wit me
Kinda black kinda bold
Ghetto soul beautiful
Still in it for you to hold
Cover girl centerfold
My spot, hot like lava rock
I get busy from Panorama City to Lompoc
You prefer hood medic procedure
Poetical breather with fever

Jurassic 5,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight

Tellin me to keep it real when they ain't payin my bills

Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you're a star
Why you frontin' (you ain't nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing

The way you behave

Will probably be with a gauge

I was sittin at the television feelin' disturbed
Hey yo, I just got the word, off Tigram and 83rd
Some cat that got clapped, (gangster rapper?)
Perhaps, But I was lookin at the face of one particular cat
Now I done seen him before, (Can you remember where at?)
Well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat
Or at a party and shit, the drive through of a Quickie Split
But the fellas he ran wit, they no longer ex- (yo, dude peep this)

[Akil]
Yo I know dude, I been knowin him all my life
Ever since I was young I used to see him shootin' dice
On occasion I would see him once or twice
With all types, many different walks of life
He tried to keep in touch, but i knew what was up
Every time he came around and showed his face I ducked
In the mid-eighties, the nigga went crazy
He had a lot of ladies selling they babies, the nigga was shady
But he had a lot of friends that he would visit on the weekends
Thrill seekin, influenced by his teachings
My daddy knew him, yo, he met him at a hotel
My homeboy Johnny, kicked it with him in a jail cell
a lot of people met him with a female
Doing real well, connected with the drug sales
The rich and the poor, for better or worse
The last and the first, walked the earth, but can't avoid his turf
And it hurts my brain, it's drivin me insane
It's a shame I can't remember his name

Man, the fuedin is on
Hey, the reason why I called, that was the cat from my building
You seen him?

[2na]
Yeah we met that brother out in Pasadena
Remember 7even, on Marengo?
No my mistake, we were right between Fair Oaks and Lake
Tryin to take us a lunch break

[Marc 7even]
And cop us a success act!

But had to drive right past the place where they rest at

[Marc 7even]
We drove in a hatch back

Corolla, these cats pack pistolas, the Cadillac they drove

[Marc 7even]
It was brown and black

[2na]
Patrollin the hood, lookin for trouble
Saw us purchasing trees
Lurkin with speed, pulled the strap, and was irkin' to squeeze

[Marc 7even]
You jerk and you bleed

[2na]
Threw it in reverse and we fled

[Marc 7even]
Or should we say fled?

They wanted to make us more than play dead, flashin his heat

Two cars are movin fast on the street

That's when I peeped, that dude was in his back passanger seat
(Yo that shit was deep) Still I can't remember his name..

Now come on man I feel like cuttin loose

You behave yourself

[Zaakir]
Oh man, where have I seen this brother before, man
Well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat
Seem like everybody I know know dude, 
But can't nobody remember his damn name man
I been knowin him all my life
The same with everybody from ShawnyMac, YawYaw, my brother Mohamed
It's like you can't can't avoid his turf
Oh, hey, you know what, now I know who homie is man, his name is

Watchin' your scene plummet
If lyrics were green vomit
My vocals would clean stomachs
Addicts wean from it
Where dreams and green run it
The faces on money change like the host on Teen Summit
I'm close to being done with this industry's cream driven
Supreme livin', seein' more demons than Gene Simmons
And mean fibbin' actors be adlibbin'
Fakin' the funk and some of us naturally had rhythm
Some of us act like they had women
Gats in the abdomen back when the fact is them cats
They didn't have nuttin'
For certain I'm sure it's fiction but for some
The purest diction
Insures their jurisdiction
I'm kicking it up a level trying to stay in the red
Some stay in the bed, zombie
Like the Day of the Dead
With decay in the head
Playin' instead of stayin' ahead
Steadily portrayin' celebs, delayin' the inevitable
When some come round
They run down when they touch ground
They climb up the structures unsound
Some of you like the way my words caress tracks
While some of these politicians secretly suppress facts

I'm sayin' through songs I write

I only hear foolishness when you speak
I repeat, my predecessor's endeavor with pleasure
Lock and load, explode and come better
Hopin' that generation X
Be more wicked with the flex
And not so quick to cash a check
And disrespect, talkin' guns and sex
Guns and death, but end up gettin' laid to rest
At your request
You're at the end of your line

But dude, if you stale
The 2na can tell
Either you're comin' to the party or you truant as hell
Politicians ain't got no problem puttin' you in the cell
It's like we rolled up a snowball and threw it in hell
See some of us are looted with mail and suited to swell
But still blind like you're fluent in Braille

Yo, I never can tell uh, why some make it or fail
Speak it and spell overcome and still prevail

We ripple the water frequently
Blink if we show delinquency, please
Human frequencies
Have been diseased, A breeze ain't what I'm feelin'

Mental aggravation shows you what we've been through

Yo, sign of the times influence the way I rhyme, man
Pick up a nine and put down your picket sign, man

Without bling I still gleam

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, what you doing after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't want to be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room

[Chali 2na]
This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of devotion

Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

Jeopardizing kinship, respect is intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in

Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

So why you wanna go and do that, huh?

[Chali 2na]
I don't know man 'cause we see fiends who dream c.r.e.a.m
Reppin' the west through special effects and green screens
And it seems you need to be the one to flash that cannon
Or sign the autographs till the last cat's standing

[Marc 7even]
Brother pass that action, and your trashin' is real
Your only way of coming up is probably inking a deal
While your thinking the skills, some are thinking the mills
In a never-ending quest ta get the house on the hill
AND THAT'S REAL

[Chorus]

[Akil]
I need some understanding in this world between me and my girl
She wants the diamonds and the pearls to be a part of my world
Twenty four-sev, but love don't pay the rent
So love me when I'm home and cherish the moment

[Chali 2na]
Uh-Huh
'cause some of you women are men's mirrors
I know some women who dodge balls like Ben Stiller
Please understand, it's not to offend or seem bitter
But every queen, need a king wit her

[Soup - singing]
Ms. Thing I don't know, when ever I leave you ready to go
My Momma told me about how it flow
But I didn't wanna listen but she told me so
Now if it ever came to the bank account
Would ya pack ya things and get up and bounce
These the type of things that I be thinking about
To all my other fellas ""you got to understand""

[Chorus]

[Chali 2na]
In all the times I tried ta do what the smartest guy do
It's 'cause I see the world from the Artist eye view
You live life the next part is you die, too
And there's no one on this earth it doesn't apply to

[Soup]
Now that's true, 'cause every single day I live
I'm obligated just ta say it like it T-I is
And I ain't gonna talk about no cat whose decision is poor
Trust me man my hand is just as dirty as yours

[Marc 7even]
Either they like you, or they hype you, it's a cycle
Choices that we make in the vi-tal
'cause in the blink of an eye it can all go awry
And the next man will quickly take your title

[Akil]
Yeah, between me and myself and all of these things
Understanding is a theme when we doing our thing
From the job to my queen and chasing my dream
The whole world needs a little bit of understanding

[Chorus]",Gotta Understand

Jurassic 5,"[Announcer]
Many, many moons ago
Jurassic 5
Began their quest
To put real hip hop on the radio

[Akil]
Now here's a little story that must be heard
About the brother with the word sounds so superb
It started way back with these emcees
Now here's a little something on the history

[Zaakir]
I'm a H-I-P H-O-P H-E-A-D, been since one-nine-eight-three
Are to the A-P-P-I-N
Eighty-four was the year I picked up the pen
At the same time breaking tryin' to come on in
But I was already in since way back when
One-nine-seven-five, the saga began
Are to the O-be	-O-T-I-N
Eighty-one I was P-O-P-P-I-N
One-nine-eighty-two D-J-in
Eighty-three it was all about Run-DMC man
A gang banger taught me how to break dance then
The same year I picked up the pen
And wrote my first rhyme and got that feelin'
And now I'm here in the flesh still dope still death
Tryin' to get my song (rockin' on the radio)

[Chorus:]
The summertime yo we would hang out
And talk about the new jam that came out
And from the way the beat was laid out
And all the emcees had turned the place out
And we would say our rhymes to the beat
Right but we never indulged in the street
Life and now we all good to go
J5 is rockin' on the radio

[Akil]
Yo I was an inner-city nigga in my room I'd sit
Poppin' off quick cause I could sing a little bit
With my hi-top fade and matchin' outfits
But once the record hit it's like listen to this
Hip hop is the reason that a brother evolved
And I was so involved I ain't gonna lie to none a y'all
By the time I started rhymin' in the late eighties
The drugs in Cali was crazy

[Chali 2na]
Nine-teen eighty
Nine's the number this is the summer
On some get rich come up Quest switch the drum up
Invested some of my best years because of
Then I repped with some of the best kids that done it
My love dates back to show, that's incredible
Brothers who lack revenue spent on they back several
Times It made me know which way to go
And now (Jurassic is rockin' on the Radio)

[Chorus]

[All Together]
I got my mind on back in the day
The style a dress and the records they play
Reminisce I got somethin' to say
Check it out cause it went this way cause it went this way

[Mark 7even]
The year was eighty-two and the block was froze
When I stepped out rockin burgundy shell-toes
A fresh mock-neck and some new Lee jeans
Add a pair a Gazelles and well you know what I mean
DJ Red Alert and Mr. Magic had static
Over Kiss FM and BLS which one is the baddest
Brothers on the block was doin' the Wop
While the cars drove by bumpin' real hip hop
The vibe and the feelin' was oh so real
We held it oh so dear so brother don't go there
Fat Boys Cold Crush Force MC's
All showed me how to really be a real emcee
From the Yes Yes y'alls to the Ladies say Ho
I can't believe my jam is (rockin' on the radio)

[Akil]
From the Yes Yes y'alls to the Ladies say Ho
I can't believe my jam (rockin' on the radio)

Jurassic 5,"[Dave Matthews - Chorus]
A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float upon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now

[Marc 7even]
We live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
Cause each and every day you would hear those four letters

[Chorus]

[Chali 2na]
These are different times but we feel the same pains
The blood of mankind runnin through the same veins
We'd like to make it right some which it remain tame
Same crimes even though they names changed
And we like different minds workin off the same brain
Passengers on different cars steppin off the same train
In the end, makin it rights the main aim
Different parts of the picture highlight the same frame

[Chorus]

[Akil]
Now if you know what I know you need to work it out (work it out)
If you ain't happy with yourself you need to work it out (work it out)
You havin problems with your family then work it
The things we go through just to work it
I work it out when the situations seems unworkable
Unreversible but God is most merciful
Many works, Many men converse
With soul search sweat it out
When they tryin to work it out

[Soup]
With the constant complaint, we either gonna make it fly
Or we ain't, I already know what some of ya think
Ima talk a hip hop and how bad its got
Then tryna pull a brother, I'm not
Lookin for nobody to judge
You said you ain't I never thought you was
I'm just tryna get with ya and pose in the same picture
So this mic thing can move the right thing do the right thing
Made for your life game, plus my man might sing

[Chorus: x 2]",Work It Out
Jurassic 5,"You know them ladies half amazin' half crazy
Baby wanna make a baby baby please what she say to me
Yeah

Ain't nuttin' new up under the sun
She want a boy
I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryin to get my funds count my ones

[Chorus]

Nuttin' new up under the sun
Got a brother up under the gun
Better run cause a girl got a plan to get a man
Ain't a ring on my hand
All she wants is me and her to be one

Uh, let me tell you how the story begun
At first thought she was the one
She was chill then so much fun
Her uzi weighed a ton
Didn't know I was chillin with a loaded gun
Can you feel or hear me son
Disappear reappear call me hang up
Love me hate me quit me date me
Baby on the low might Robert Blake me

You want your problem solved holla dog
Can't be seen with her in the mall
Givin' you a piece of my catalogue
Never thought you would pull up at a broad
But I had it y'all
Bagged it y'all
Hate it when a girl get mad at y'all
I'm savage y'all
Don't panic nah
The reason why a fly nigga haven't called

[Chorus]

Ain't nuttin' new up under the sun
No money no car why you call me a bum
Cause you got cake and I'm scrapin' crumbs
Now I'm on the video your face look stunned

[Chorus]

Nutin up under the sun
Fellas succumb when they nails and they hair get done
It's better for some to tell'em when young
Keep'em under space in the place til they head get spun

I can't mess wit you hoes
Out to get my dough
Alterior with the mo
From my heart the plot is closed
You know
You thought since I was nice
Since I was blind like some mice
But I'm a man with that vice
Baby please get it right

All of us used to walk the world
Akward scared to talk to girls
Every flavor even chocolate swirl
Can't get a housewife from a stalker girl
Ah ah
Cannot handle a high caliber woman
Camera hold steady
A blast and I'm a move it around
Tryin take advantage and vanish for standing how I'm a get down

[Chorus]

Ain't nutin new up under the sun
She want a boy
I don't want none
Girl just wanna have fun
I'm tryin to get my funds count my ones

[Chorus]

Uh, I'm a break it down real real quick
Just cause she fine don't mean she fine
In the time it took me to write this rhyme
Baby done slept with all man kind
Don't play me play lotto
You can't rip it like no throttle
Get yo ass up out that bottle girl
Stuck up in some model world

Let me spit this man
With miss thang
Put it in the way just to get this Jane
Sorry girlfriend I forgot your name
Don't blame me just blame the game

Your claim to fame ain't your brain
Without no game her end can't complain
She don't wanna make the change
She just wanna shake that thing and chase that fame

So what I want to do right know is
Is I want to take this timeout just to introduce everybody

From the people on the bottom
And the people in the back on both sides

And keep 'em guessing from the old to the adolescent

We came here tonight just to celebrate

I can tell just by the way you retreat
Cactus is a discreed fact
They heat rap beat gaps but stay of the knee rack
So you could put your seat back
Pick up your feet and bring facts
Rhymes and beats that we create can defeat that weak crap

Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh

Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh

And foretold to scores of six years ago

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes why'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like Joe Greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss 
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Mazeratti engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity

Jürgen Drews,"Sommerabend über blühendem Land
Schon seit Mittag stand ich am Straßenrand
Bei jedem Wagen, der vorüber fuhr, hob ich den Daumen
Auf einem Fahrrad kam da ein Mädchen her
Und sie sagte, ich bedaure dich sehr
Doch ich lachte und sprach, ich brauch keine weichen Daunen

Ein Bett im Kornfeld, das ist immer frei
Denn es ist Sommer und was ist schon dabei?
Die Grillen singen und es duftet nach Heu
Wenn ich träume, hmm
Ein Bett im Kornfeld zwischen Blumen und Stroh
Und die Sterne leuchten mir sowieso
Ein Bett im Kornfeld mach ich mir irgendwo
Ganz alleine

Etwas später lag ihr Fahrrad im Gras
Und so kam es, dass sie die Zeit vergaß
Mit der Gitarre hab ich ihr erzählt von meinem Leben
Auf einmal rief sie, es ist höchste Zeit
Schon ist es dunkel und mein Weg ist noch weit
Doch ich lachte und sprach
Ich hab Dir noch viel zu geben

Ein Bett im Kornfeld, das ist immer frei
Denn es ist Sommer und was ist schon dabei?
Die Grillen singen und es duftet nach Heu
Wenn wir träumen hmm
Ein Bett im Kornfeld zwischen Blumen und Stroh
Und die Sterne leuchten uns sowieso
Ein Bett im Kornfeld mach ich uns irgendwo

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

But then jacking our slang
I used to get dizzy spells, and hear a little ring
The voice of a angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'mma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don spittin out flames

Telling lies
Truthfully
Our eyes are wide
But we don't see
Walking tall
Feeling small
Lonely but
Won't take that call
I contradict
Myself and then
Wonder why
I do it all again

Just Jack,"I'm pushing out into the blueness 
A soul soothing silence 
Helping me to get through this 
I'm floating breathless 
Calmer that a Buddhist 
In the newness 
Of a world untouched by 
Human hands 
It's undiscovered civilisations in uncharted lands 
I'm diving deeper to ocean floors afar 
A landscape so alien 
It's like you're on Mars 
Anemones and coral 
Iridescent in the half light 
As shoals of fish catch the tide 
And drift out of sight 

Tell me what you're waiting for 
What's keeping you here 
Step into the blueness 
Let nothing interfere 
You never know 
You may like the deep thrill 
So why not stay a while if 
You've got time to kill 

Fluid motions in the weightlessness 
Well it's all forgotten worries 
And long gone stress 
A million miles from mean streets like this 
Now we drink black coffee in downtown Atlantis 
Washed clean of the grime and the city sins 
The only sharks you'll find down here have fins 
You're under threat no longer 
So close your eyes 
And we can navigate by sonar 
Into dark depths where evolution stands still 
And submarine winds 
Blow through the silent chill 
You're introduced to the deep thrill 
So why not stay awhile if 
You've got time to kill 

Tell me what you're waiting for 
What's keeping you here 
Step into the blueness 
Let nothing interfere 
You never know 
You may like the deep thrill 
So why not stay a while if 
You've got time to kill

I'm pushing out into the blueness",Deep Thrills
Just Jack,"Sometimes I wonder how I cope 
When every time I open my mouth 
You jump down my throat 
And some nights the beds so cold 
In frozen sheets 
It's like we're lying at opposite poles 
And I just don't know 
What to do 
Loosen my grip 
Or take a tighter hold on you 
Just remember 
That you came looking for me 
I didn't hunt in someone else's territory 
You presented the opportunity 
It was you who pursued me 
Maybe you just needed the change 
And got a kick out of playing the game 
I know you don't like things that stay the same 
So I guess you're not to blame 
I suppose its my fault again 

[Chorus]
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye 
But I don't ask too many questions why 
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye 
But I don't ask too many questions why 

Neither of us knew what to expect 
What was gonna happen next 
So we cherished every caress 
Sorry I wasn't there 
When you needed a rest 
A shoulder to cry on 
Moral support 
Honestly 
I always thought about you 
And I hated the fact 
We only had 
Brief moments of contact 
We'll survive and if we persevere 
Then maybe this will last for years 
I don't mean to exert pressure 
I just wanna give 
And receive pleasure 
And if you're pouring 
I'll have full measure 
'cause it's you I'll treasure 
Even if we're not together 

[Chorus]

Even though these questions still remain 
Time won't change a single thing 
We're still playing all these selfish games 
But I'd hate to hate you 
Why do all the questions stay the same 
Why do all you're answers cause me pain 
Do I need to say it all again 
I'd hate to hate you

Look 
I know we're not exactly Romeo and Juliet 
But come on 
I ain't nowhere near ready to quit on this yet",Eye to Eye
Just Jack,"There's a dragon 
Blowing fire 
In my ventricles 
And I can feel 
The grip now 
Of these tentacles 
And I had ideas 
Back when I was very young 
Like the back of my hand 
I thought I'd understand 
But now I find myself 
Just playing dumb 

[Chorus]
Heartburn 
And my soul 
Is red raw 
Inside 
Heartburn 
And don't the world look different 
When you're lying on the floor 
Heartburn 
And my soul 
Is red raw 
Inside 
Heartburn 
And don't the world look different 
When you're lying on the floor 

There's a lion 
Tearing holes 
In my ventricles 
And I'm feeling 
The effect now 
Of these combining chemicals 
And I had ideas 
Back when I was very young 
I thought I could weather the storm 
I would not need your warmth 
But now I find myself 
Just praying for the sun 

[Chorus]

I'm not joking 
The floor is sloping 
Towards the things I never wanted to be near 
The drop of a tear 
Another year 
Seen in retrospect 
Images I collect 
Answers correct 
As we continue 
To break and connect 

[Chorus: x2]",Heartburn
Just Jack,"It's hard sometimes trying to be a geezer
A good bloke
Five pints down the local pub
Laughing at a filthy joke
And sleeping around
Just so that you can brag about it
You've got to get the crumpet
So you can blow your own trumpet
And talking about football
When you couldn't really give a fuck
About Owen being injured
And Watford's run of bad luck
And cheering when a fight breaks out
Even though you're feeling sick
As a parrot
But like a donkey to a carrot
You can't help yourself
'cause any sign of weakness
Could be used to inflict injuries
By one of your so-called friends
To hide his own insecurities
And nothing to look forward to
But daily stress and bringing home the bacon
And thinking about the other half of your wages
The tax man keeps taking
Staying strong emotionally
When your soul is breaking
And wondering when you're making love to your wife
Is it real or is she faking
And could it be that the most important things in life
Are getting lost or missed
When you're playing it safe
One of the lads
And scared to take a risk

[CHORUS]

It's so hard
It's so hard
Sometimes
And sometimes
It's so hard
It's so hard
When you're scared

Its hard sometimes trying to be a geezer
A good lad
With pressures to get on in life
And turn out like your dad
And getting a house, dog, kids, car
The whole kit and caboodle
And making out you can't cook
Apart from pot noodle
Treating your lady with sensitivity
Without the boys finding out
And keeping your feelings under wraps
So she'll never know what you're about
Trying to be different
But the same
And trying to follow the rules
Of the new game
Staring at the picture in the frame
An easier time, smiles shine
Now almost everything's changed.

[CHORUS]

Well sometimes its so hard
It's so hard
It's so hard
Yeah
When you're scared to
You're scared to
You're scared to
To take a risk
To take a risk
To take a risk

Because I'm not the foolish kind

That you've got something about you
But please don't think for a minute

She was in my life
And now she's out of my life

Just Jack,"Hangin about in the sun
With prozac Annie and the schizo alcoholics
The sharp edged shadows
And these mad electronics
The barbeque's burning
With the moon-ray sensations
I'm lying on my back
And watching cloud formations
Trying to see the beauty
Minus the black inside
She told me people came here
To get drunk before they died
Too many problems
And not enough solutions
Ms. Monroe is in the bathroom
Taking care of her ablutions
Hiding myself behind illusions
Stand back and watch the evolution
Of the secondhand lives your using
So many fucked up souls
In this locality
I need the choice of some
Relative banality
The raw twistings of your mind spewing forth
As you stare at me
Is fucking scaring me

Paradise lost and paradise found
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground
Paradise lost and paradise found
And I'm just trying to get lost in my sound
Paradise lost and paradise found
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground

Storms rage across
Metallic skies
Reflecting in the multi faceted eyes
Of lazy buzzing flies
The heavens collide
In primeval cacophonies
I contemplate my demise
And hope the gods are appeased
A long distance love affair that's alive
But barely breathing
A thousand times I thought about leaving
Giving all this up
And put myself at your mercy
But still scared to death
About the fact you might hurt me
Instead I came here
And became an agony uncle
And now I'm saddled with this
Freaky carbuncle
Who's stalking me forcefully
And I'm begging her
Please let me go about my business peacefully
Let my days flow seamlessly
'cause since you've been around
Everything's got so messy
You stress me
God bless me and test me
Daily

[CHORUS]

Well it's the original tales of the unexpected
You thought I couldn't do it
Now stand corrected
'cause I'm connected
To every nerve ending
Cerebral cortex messages
I'm sending
There's two sides to every story
Black and white
The day and night
Wrong and right
And the paradise lost and found
All inside this sound

Well I'm a secret lemonade drinker a free thinker
I stay focused but not blinkered
And these snapshot memories in my mind
Legacies from another time
And I find
That as the days pass the colours fade
But the images remain

[Part II]

Grazed knees, page three's
BMX, Atari's

Dayglo, Velcro
Yoyo's, Beano's

Hip hop, don't stop

Starwars figures, football stickers
Cola bottles, Jerry Cottles

Fat laces, dirty faces
Kiss chases, Wacky Races

Herbie Hancock, Kurtis Blow
Roxanne Shanté, UFO

Hip hop
Don't stop

Everything's in slow motion
Hands in the air
Sweat flying everywhere
But we don't care
Well you could try to fight the feeling
But I can't see the use
There's so much love in this room
And yes its all drug induced
Can't remember who I am
Or what I'm doing here
But at the same time
In my mind
Everything is clear
No fear and no drama
It's all good karma
And I never can forget
The night before the morning after

[CHORUS]

Sun up to sun down
Come up to come down
Just waiting for Friday to come around
Sun rise to sun set
How high can we get
Monday morning and none of us have slept yet

Well there's more to life than this
Of that I'm fully aware
But there's nothing more intense
Than crazy nights we shared
We got bass for the body
Chemicals for the head
Every day lives
Were like a skin we shed
Well you could try to fight the feeling
But I can't see the use
There's so much love in this room
Of that we're living proof
You could try to fight the feeling
But I can't see the use
It's a shame that in the end
It was all drug induced

[CHORUS x2]

[Part IV]

Even as I watch you
All the rest seems to disappear
You pull me in with your tractor beams
And wrap me up in your wicked schemes
My Sunday morning eyes observe
Your Cadbury's skin uncurve
And in tronic patterned Venetian light
You moonwalk to the bathroom
Well you move across my space without friction
You're so unbelievable you must be fiction
Or perhaps a premonition
But as I listen
I hear your footfall softly
And all my troubles fall away from me
So easily
But so slowly

I'm still a secret lemonade drinker
",Snapshot Memories
Just Jack,"I move in your mental stream in complex dances and jigs,
I loosen up your consciousness like a syrup of figs,
Its time to emerge from camouflage, leaves and twigs,
Time to throw away the fake noses and fright wigs,

Time to face the music, no more metaphor,
Time to decide your fate, will you be cooked or go raw?
Will you be rare and bloody with your soul exposed?
Or well done, a charcoal surface with your insides froze?

And do you feel fear as you hear another door close?
Or will you just turn away and flow where the wind blows?
And are you still satisfied with the pathways you chose?
Or would you like to go back and rewrite the old prose?

[Chorus]
Do you count the flakes when it snows 
And can you feel the heat or only the afterglows?
Do you count the flakes when it snows, yeah?
And do you count the leaves when they fall and can you feel anything at all?
Do you count the leaves when they fall, yeah?

And does your life sometimes feel like one big fake orgasm?
A gut reaction, instinctive spasm in the chasm
And do your problems metamorphose into Rubik's Cubes?
Keep twisting and turning but can't be more confused
And do you sometimes feel like you've been used and abused?
You're not visibly black and blue but on the inside bruised
And does your love life leave you feeling kinda bemused?
You played all the games and you're no longer amused, ha ha

[Chorus]

Sometimes it feels like I'm looking though a pane of glass 
I can see your mouth move but can't hear the words

Sometimes it feels like I'm looking though a pane of glass

Sometimes it feels like I'm looking though a pane of glass

They play back in my head

And I was enchanted by the way

In many ways you save me 
And keep my head above water 
You know your own mind so well 
And won't surrender any quarter 
Well if this is a dream 
I'll keep my eyes wide shut forever 
If this is a dream 
I hope I'm in a coma

And then you bring me back to life

I know you've been through it 
And that I do respect

How can we connect 
I realize this is strange love 
But we should let it flow 
And you don't need to say anything 
'Cause I already know 
Don't it feel right dear 
Now we're making eye contact 
And yes it feels right here

she's got a whole lot of disco friends,
Disco ladies and gentlemen,
Eating their faces from the inside out,
Freaky dancing til the late am,
Music stripping down the wall I swear,
She's catching fishies in her disco net,
Throwing kisses in the powder room,
Slowly sucking on a cigarette

She knows an awful lot of disco kids,
Novelty sun glasses and mullet wigs,
She says she wants to be a stylist,
Or maybe something in the music biz,
Daddies rich, mummies beautiful,
They always said she'd make a top model,
But now she's hiding out in disco land,
A happy clappy trust experience

Just Jack,"I'm feelin' groovy, kickin' down the cobblestones
And there is music in every sight and every sound
No need for headphones
I'll tip my cap to the world even though I don't wear one
Grinnin' at the women in the salon gettin' their hair done

On the outside looking in like an aquarium
Spinnin' with the stars in the planetarium
Deliriously, mysteriously I'm feelin' curiously marvelously
'Super Duper' like Joss Stone

My heart melts like ice cream cones
Grinnin' like a dog diggin' up dinosaur bones
I used to be fossilized but now I'm out of my shell
And I'm happier than whores with chivalrous clientèle

This can't be real, I must be dreamin' could somebody slap me
I'm feelin' so mischievous, original cheeky chappy
It must be ages since I felt satisfied
Just to be Just Jack and just that, still intact

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days

I'm so warm, new dawn, reborn, new forms
And I'm thinkin' about my boys Joelly chic and Freshly Sean
And I know you're underrated but one day we'll all make it
And walk around naked with our bullocks platinum plated

Anyway, I'm off track gotta stop that
And get back to the high street, I need somethin' to eat
Stop at the cafe, coffee and a salt beef bagel
Yeah, I know I'm Cain'd but now I'm feelin' Abel

I used to get so paranoid In places like this
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis
My neurosis was thinkin' everybody's staring at my red eyes
And shifty expression but now I'm past carin'

And I can feel that destiny is on my side
And by the looks of things, fate came along for the ride
Behind green skies, I can see my girl's eyes
Damn it, I'm in love with this planet, you gotta realize

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days

It's time to look to the future
Just when I was gettin' used to the humdrum
I realized in the depths of my depression
That I really wanted to be someone

So let's smash the past like a tacky figurine
On the back page of a supplementary magazine
But for the time being, bump your head to the beat
Sit back, put your feet up and relax

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed

And all the under achievin' geezers getting more lean and peezer
On melon Bacardi Breezers and skinny plastic cached reefers

And every impotent porn star
And the girls with the red lights on, doin' tricks for Mars bars
And all the ravers wishin' they were back in '89
'Cause everythin' was so much better the first time

Just Jack,"Picture this, 2:30 on the hottest night in June
He awakes for no reason and checks his watch by the moon
And his mouth feels as dry as his eyes as he struggles to rise
And stops to contemplate his wifes thighs as he does up his flies

He finds his slippers where he left them under the chair
Behind the two cups and an old copy of Marie Claire
And he switches on the coffee machine
That of course works like a dream
Catches sight of his reflection in the silver surface sheen

And it's a face he knows well although it should look less abused
With all these moisturizers and the skin products he's used
As he moves through the kitchen, his homage to brushed steel
Across the new pine floorin' that's plastic but looks real

Past the plasma with the wide screen
And the cinema surround sound
And he stops on his favorite spot by the window and looks down
On the orange lit street at the edge of the private car park
Where his Audi TT is waitin' safely in the dark

Keepin' it all inside of you
Somethin' will have to give
And if you could you'll take it back
But you lose your way in the way you live

Now he can hear wind chimes tinklin' out on the balcony
And his phone beepin' out a text message in the same key
He checks it and it?s Jill who used to be his secretary
Before they started an affair and things began to get really scary

Now his wife Mary is gettin' weary of his lies
Like she's read the whole sordid story in his eyes
It doesn't help that Jill?s now sayin' that she's two weeks late
His mental state is really startin' to deteriorate

He never knew how he got so out of his depth
Or why he's broken more than all these promises kept
And it?s been ages since he slept properly
His sleeps now broken by these dreams of extra-marital activity

Tryin' to recapture the rapture he used to get
From his material possessions and endless retail therapy sessions
Shoulda listened to what his dad said before he died
?The best things in life are the ones you can't buy, son?

Keepin' it all inside of you
Somethin' will have to give
Wish you could buy a ticket back
But you lose your way in the way you live

He used to feel so safe up here in his shrine to IKEA
Away from the shouts and the louts and the girls

Just Jack,"Morning light don't scratch my eyes
Just let me wash up on a shore
I used to have the strangest dreams
But they don't come here anymore

My duvet's laid out like an atlas
With stains to mark the borderlines
Indentations in my pillow
I hope won't fade with time

Smoke the roach left in the ashtray
On which I choked the night before
Stubbed my toes on dirty clothes
Like mountain ranges on a floor

I pick my way through crusty dishes
And their greasy chemistry
I washed two cups and then remember
That you've left already

I let you go so reluctantly
And I can still hear your lazy symphony
And just when I think I found my calling
It's another mourning morning

They say the devil's in the detail
I'm gonna blind my eyes instead
I put my memories in a landscape
Where only reckless angels tread

And watch the fingerprints you left
Like a secret code upon my skin
And I remember when you told me
A gilded crown won't make a king

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go
I really want you to stay
But sometimes it doesn't show

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go
I really want you to stay
Let the conversation flow

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go
I really want you to stay
But sometimes it doesn't show

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go
Have to go again

I let you go so reluctantly
And I can still hear your lazy symphony
And just when I think I found my calling
It's another mourning morning

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go
I really want you to stay

Have we rowed and thrown tantrums?
And how many times have we loaded
And cocked the hammers on our verbal guns?

And how many times has crockery and cutlery
And cups of tea been thrown at me?
How many times have I thrown words back at you
I knew could cut you to the bone?

How many times have we slept side by side
A thousand miles apart?
How many times have we thought
We could finish something we could never even start?

How many times have I said I love you
And I hate you in the same breath?
How many times have we tried
To grab something when there was nothing?

Warned us against this?
And I can't remember a time
When I have felt so restless

I'm leaving you no matter what you do?

In your velvet corridors
Sticky walls and sugar floors

Butterfly wings on a slender tree
You can take a walk down my avenue

Tiny diamonds fall like rain upon your hair

But I had to do without
Now I'm simply ravenous

Flicking tongues so sneakily

Just Jack,"I must have got up about twenty to seven
Had a shower and had breakfast
And had a couple of pieces of toast
You know, forced it down

Then had a cup of coffee
It was pouring with rain
And I thought oh God
You know, good old England

I get this writer's block
It comes as quite a shock
And now I'm stuck between
A hard place and the biggest rock

In my own head consumed
I sit back in my room
It's like the tapestries of life
Get tangled in the loom

I'm like a butterfly
Caught in a hurricane
My pulse is quickenin'
As my heart plays a new refrain

I'm lovin' Mary Jane
Flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train

Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(I always hoped that it would happen)
(But I never thought it really would)

Sometimes at night I think too much
About life and love and music and stuff
I mustn't sort of build
My hopes was too high

I'm livin' in the past
My clock's an hour fast
Should really go and make a coffee
But I can't be arsed

I've lost my mobile phone
You'll have to call my home
On second thoughts, just leave a message
When you hear the tone

My grimy windows show
The early morning glow
Another day, another dollar
In my one man show

I'm lovin' Mary Jane
Flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came

Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came

I don't speak to Lois Lane
And I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I

I'm always finding new ways to touch your body
(Want to I don't want to I know)

You're in for some trouble
The drinks have faded 
Along with her good looks
Nows the time for thinking
What have I done?
Where have my standards gone?
It all seems so strange now
An empty head and an arm across my chest
I know there's been worse
But I'm grabbing my clothes
As I dash to try and catch a ride

I'm sure
She's down 
For what anyone's down for tonight
(She is going down)
I'm the last now 
Dripping with the crap from the ones tonight
I spent with you

I shouldn't know you
This fever is driving me
It should get better than this

And I don't think I can stop myself

Justin,"We've been closer than lovers, Better
Than friends have ever been
And When I think about it I can't say
When this happened, oh, baby!

Your love and your kiss is, all I desire
One look into you eyes and I feel the fire
And it warms my heart and heals my soul
Always, always

[Chorus]
And you don't have to worry, you don't
Have to cry
You won't have to look for another
And don't be afraid to put love on the line
Cause you'll never find disappointment this time

I spend my nights in sorrow wondering
When the light will shine through
The clouds
Then your love comes with no
Questions and erases all my doubt

Every step, every breath's taking me
Higher, the brightest of angels must
Have conspired to
Cross our paths for a love that lasts
Always, always

[Chorus]

And when I look in your eyes,
I see a world where we share our dreams together

My kiss will be waiting, my heart will
Keep beating for you - forever

So you don't have to worry

Don't cry cry baby, you won't have to look for another

Whoa 
And don't be afraid (don't be afraid) to put love on the line
Cause you'll never find disappointment

Justin,"If my life was like a jigsaw, pieces of paste, 
Come on over, put a smile upon my face,
And if all my bad days came at once, you would
Know just what to do, come on over, baby you
Can see me through it...

And if you think I need you, come on over,
Bring your love around, can wipe away the tears,
Oh, and if you think I need you, come on over, 
Lay your body down, you know I will be here, 
Bring your love around, yeah

Days, come on over, you can take it all away,
And when the laughter starts to fade, smiling off 
My face, come on over, bring it back with your 
Embrace...

And if you think I need you, come on over,
Bring your love around, can wipe away the tears,
My tears, ooh, and if you think I need you, come 
On over, lay your body down, you know I will be 
Here, bring your love around...

And If you think I need you, come on over,
Bring your love around, can wipe away the tears,
All of my tears, oh baby, and if you think I need you, 
Come on over, body down, lay your body down, you

Its not that i want to, not to say but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words, is all you have to do to make it real 
Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me
Cause I'd already know
What would you do
If my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love is really real
What would you say
If I took those words away
Then you couldn't make it new 
Just by saying I love you
More than words
Now that I've tried to, talk to you and make you understand
All that you have to do is close your eyes 
And just reach out your hands
And touch me, hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know

Justin,"Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details

Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And was away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me

Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence",Perfect Peace

The night of our dreams

If you give, give your first dance to me

Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor

The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, 'cause I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
'Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm sixteen and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you
And hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love
And it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong
I am gone
I thought I loved her
Never put no one above her
Yes she was my lover
But now on to another like

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oh

It just tears me apart

You see I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reach the point of no return

And there's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up

Guess who?
J-Smith and J-B!
I gotcha lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me!
I be trying a chill
They be trying to side with the thrill.
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove.
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water for blood. (lets go)
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyiest.
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant.
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land.

And its starting today

I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need

Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change?

Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
What you doin' to me
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're trying to break my heart
It's working cause you know

That should be me, holding your hand
That should be me, making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me, feeling your kiss
That should be me, buying you gifts
This is so wrong I can't go on
Till you believe
That should be me

I need to know should I fight for our love
Or disarm
It's getting harder to shield
This pain in my heart oh oh

That should be me, holding your hand
That should be me, making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me
That should be me
That should be me, feeling your kiss
That should be me, buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on
Till you believe
That that should be me

Holding your hand
That should be me
The one making you laugh (oh baby oh)
That should be me

That should be me
Giving you flowers
That should be me
Talking for hours

Justin Bieber,"Never say never (never never never)

You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reach the point of no return

And there's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)
And never say never (ne-never say never)
(Ne-never say never)
(Ne-never say never)
Never say it, never, never say it

I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)

'Cause there's just no turnin' back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)
And never say never

Here we go
Guess who?
J-Smith and J-B!
I gotcha lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me

I be trying to chill
They try to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)

I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the fliest
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon is where I land
(I'm gone)

Yeah
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)

Never say never

I will never say never (never say never)
I will fight till forever (make it right)

I will not stay on the ground

Next show they gotta up the zeroes
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old

The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me

Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules

Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping

It's about time for you give to charity
Rarely do people, don't wanna even help at all

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
Its in the papers, its on the TV,
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite,
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner,
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference
And its starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change?

Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share

And my flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived

Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me

In every limelight
Emotions ain’t the same if it ain’t about you, I don’t get it

You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don’t nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

It don’t make sense, no

Without you girl I ain’t the man
Could never be all I could be
You over stand, I’m incomplete
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo’d up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Couple times you would made it back, be patient
Won’t you pull up to me now, I’m forever young
It’s amazing
I don’t want to sleep unless you at home

Got your message today asking how am I,
Well I'm doing just fine.
To admit the truth,
Hasn't crossed my mind.
All I needed was some time,
Was it always this strong
I remember all how I cried

The night that you said goodbye,
You expected me to die.
But I made a brand new start,
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do,
To get myself over you
I'm not falling apart.
You underestimate the condition of my heart

There was a time
You were every breath of mine
I was ready to give the rest of my life
You walked away,
And now you're saying you can walk right back into my life
Like nothing happened and I won't put up a fight.
No, you left me all alone
I wanna know, where were you when I cried?

You expected me to die.

Cause it's not gonna matter anyway
Am I getting through to you,
I've heard it all before
And now you've changed your mind

Lover, it's an endless night
And I'm alone with these regrets of hurting you
Never thought I'd be misled
And turned away from all those dreams that we once knew

Tasted love sweet as honey
But the lie playing with my mind
Turned my back on emotions
Like they were drops in the ocean
Wasted time, it's caught up in the lie

That only time can heal this lonely need in me
Oh, someday (someday)
Somehow (somehow)
We're gonna find our way
So, dance with me again in this forgivin' rain

Wasted time, it's caught up in a lie, oh

Everyday away from you
Tears could fill an ocean blue
Deeper waters take me to an emptiness inside

Take me from a loveless end

I see it all baby in your eyes
And when you look at me you know I feel it too, yes I do

Making me shiver let's make it last
Why should we lose it? Don't ever let me go

If you can't put the words to the tune,
Tell the rhyme from the reason,

Travellers in a storm,
Finding love is warm.

I was hearing, hearing your voice
And the things that you said
Well, they left me, left me no choice

And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how
If I could show you now

Well I dreamed last night
You were calling, calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets
Calling my name

And you told me, lost, was the key
And you told me, how you long to be free
That you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms, that have found you

Don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Oh, don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go, set it free

Oh, I dreamed last night
I was hearing, hearing your voice
Why did you say those things
That have left me, left me no choice?

When you told me, we had the power
Why did you tell me, now, was the hour
But you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you

Oh, don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now

Is it that forever is hard to find

Saved by the song we can sing

And lonely is the night

I knew from the silence
That something was wrong
Turning I realised
I wanted to cry

But where will you go
And who will be your guide
And which way will you turn

'cause I never told you
No you'll never really know

We had all the magic to put us on our way

All so frightening
We couldn't see which move to make

And leading you astray

I'm with you through the night, 
I've listened to your dreams, 
I feel the presence that you've seen.
 
Step out of the darkness 
And into the light. 
The words of the promise 
That was made were right: 

No tears and no trouble, 
No heartache, no pain. 
I know that we're going to be one again. 

Still waters run so deep, 
The world listens when you speak. 
One nation of the free 
All believing that there'll be 

No troubles, no hunger, 
No heartache, no pain. 
I know that we're living to be one again. 
Walk out of the darkness 
And into the sun, 
And wake to the morning 

When we live as one. 
Step out of the darkness

And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn

And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire

Justin Hayward,"We went to the room and we bolted the door,
The bass from the jukebox was coming through the floor,
And out through the walls we could still hear the roar of the trains.
Was this all the comfort we got for our sins?
No candles, no waiters, no soft violins?
A dirty electric convector plugged into the mains.

I had wanted much more for the first night with you,
But the railway hotel was the best I could do.
I knew the Savoy would have suited you well,
But the best I could do was the railway hotel.

Away in the sky were the lights of a jet,
Burning in the night like a slow cigarette.
The lamp in the street threw a soft silhouette on the wall.
And though it was crumbling and rundown and dead
A chair and a sink and an old single bed,
The love we began and the things that we said, I recall.

Without no seam nor fine needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane

And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather

Justin Hayward,"There's a lady who's sure 
All that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

Ooh  ooh  and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder. 
There's a feeling I get 
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen 
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking. 
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder. 
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn

And did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 
And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our soul. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How ev'rything still turns to gold.

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

This is what you've been waiting for all these years
Just before I nodded he hollered in my ear

Whatever you do don't let go
It's time to be a cowboy don't you know
If you get through this you got it whipped

Justin McBride,"Me and my son were in a tack shop one day, he'd just got a pony for his seventh birthday.
He needed a rig and we found one he liked 
And I was tryin' to get the old feller to come down off his price and he said son,
Let me give you some cowboy advice

There's a few things a man needs to know
As he travels this trail we call life
Like don't ever eat yellow snow
Or bed down with a tougher mans wife
Get your water upstream from the herd
But the best lesson I've ever learned is

Good saddles ain't cheap
But there're worth every dime
And you'll be glad you've got one
When you're on a long ride
You know a deal and a bargain
Are often misunderstood
Good saddles ain't cheap
Cheap saddles ain't good

Said, you might save yourself a few dollars
Feel pretty smart at the time
But there's nothing that hurts any smarter
Than a galled raw blistered behind
And you're vertebrae's all out of whack
Not to mention your poor horses back
Good saddles ain't cheap
But there're worth every dime
And you'll be glad you've got one
When you're on a long ride
You know a deal and a bargain
Are often misunderstood
Good saddles ain't cheap
Cheap saddles ain't good

It depends on what you want to spend
But you get what you pay for my friend

Justin McBride,"I think sometimes war is necessary
But I pray every night for peace on Earth
I hand out my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work

My daddy gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
So hate me if you want to
But love me if you can

I stand by the right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV
And before all this debatin' turns to angry words and hate
Maybe we should just agree to disagree
And I believe that Jesus looks down here and sees us
And if you ask him he would say

I'm a man of my convictions
Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight

Justin McBride,"Twenty dollars out of momma's purse
Bought us a tank of gas some Redman tobacco
When we were just teenage kids
Me and my old buddy Johnny we'd go riding around
If there was trouble to be found
But man we dang sure did

Cutting donuts in the fields
'Till old man Smith would call the cops
He'd come running out with a shotgun
'Cause we were running down his crops
And I reckon he's still wondering who that was
Well that was us

Now some of these local boys moved on
But we never changed a bit
Don't guess we had enough sense
Least that's what folks said,
Then we finally turned old enough to buy our own beer
Don't remember much about that year
But lucky we ain't dead
'Cause somebody said they saw some boys with a truck looked just like mine
Tryin' to pull down that old water tank
Sits out by the county line
And people wonder why it leans the way it does
Well that was us

Seems like small towns never change
But things get tough when times get hard
And they said when he got sick
That old man Smith would have lost that farm
'Cause he was gettin' way behind on all his bills
'Till someone came and brought his crops in from the fields
Yeah, folks round here still don't know who that was

Yeah, I had to break it to you punk
But all that stuff ain't got a thing to do with being tough

Cause tough is your fingers bleeding

That's tough

It might seem that I'm comin' down a little hard on you
But you think you're a man and you still gotta lot of growin' up to do
I bet you talk a big game when you're hangin' with your boys in some pool hall
But I wonder how you'd act if you ever had your back up against the wall
Yeah I'm sure those joints you hang out in get pretty rough
But you've got a lot to learn about being tough

Cause tough is a single mom workin' three jobs so her kids can eat
Tough is reading bed time stories when your body's begging you to go to sleep

It wasn't school boys and ladies it was cow towns and sin

Then I took myself out, sat in the crowd,
And learned how Bocephus shakes 'em down

Push it up to ten and crank it

If you ain't got a bunch, you gotta bank it

Said how'd you make it here from Tennessee
She must've been late and didn't catch my show
But when you play at 7 that's the way it goes
So I tipped my hat and we sang along to
""Where Have All My Rowdy Friends Gone""
I climbed up on the bus after the show
Had a shot of Jim Beam and we hit the road.

Find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Tell 'em we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch him wave
And losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

I'd hug all three of those girls we lost
From the class of ninety nine
And I'd find my bird dog Bo and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in fifty three
And Janis to sing the second verse of ""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talked
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud

You'll come runnin' back

Has he kissed you in a hay field
As the sumer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama,
Back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate,
Or take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song,
Every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so

Justin Moore,"We can pop a top on a bottle of boons
Have a front row seat to a big full moon
Kick back and listen to the crickets in the field
Find a star we can call our own
Watch the lightning bugs 'till they're gone
Light a fire of passion and lay real still

In the bed of my Chevy on the out skirts of town
We can dance standin' up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you if you'll let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy

Baby slide off your boots down to your bare feet
Those cut offs and tan lines are killin' me
Move on over lay your head on my shoulder we'll stay a while
Still a little kiss as the whiperwills,
Sing to the trees with a southern feel
We can sit on the tailgate and wait 'till it feels right.

Justin Moore,"I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
I wake up and I make two black cups of coffee
The routine being with you taught me left its mark
These old, old habits die hard

I get in the car and turn the radio on
Expecting you to sing along but you never start
It's a lonely road and I can't see where it ends
Where I'm goin' and where we've been are so far apart
These old, old habits die hard

I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
'Cause old, old habits die hard

These four walls are slowly closing in around me
Without your light I'm here drowning in the dark
I pick up the phone then I come straight to my senses
I know the consequences of going that far

Where none of us will hurt
I'll see ol' St. Peter

But God I hope and pray

There's just one dirt road
That takes me back to a honey hole
A hundred year old white oak tree
Layin' shade on me
Pickin' blackberries off the vine
A Bobwhite whistling out through the pines
I can't wait to walk those streets of gold
But give me just one dirt road

Hang up mama's clothesline
Between those two pine trees
Lay some round bales in a hay field
And a bridge across the creek
Let it wind past that white church
Where I gave my soul to you
And dead end at Granny's house
Amen I'm through

I hope there's just one dirt road

A desperate wind wouldn't even blow,
I ran with the outskirt crowd loud
And proud, burnin' up the road.
Pourin' whiskey on the fire
Spinnin' tires and never hit the brakes.
'Cause that just means you're weak

But you,
You never tried to change me
You just tried to save me
And you, you found a way to trust me
Despite the broken pieces of me,
That's how I know you love me

Never fall or let love knock him down
Run on through the night
Shootin' out the lights on the heartless

Tonight here in the dark I'll hold ya
In my arms and never let you go.

Took a little ride down 95
Pulled off on a little county road
Hit the Cracker Barrel home cookin’ ya know
Had to get a taste of the real world
Bought a camo shirt from the gift shop girl
Hit a gravel road not far from there
A little nature trip just looking for deer
Grandma was sittin’ in the backseat
Saw a little commotion going on
She said try not to stare but look over there Lord I swear

That’s a field fulla hillbillies
A bunch of trucks jacked up kicked back
Hanging out like chill billies

So they watched a little while sitting there in the car
Pretty soon they started pulling out Mason jars
Filling up little red cups of plastic
Like a scene outta National Geographic
The sun was going down so they lit a fire
The party had some kinda cave man desire
The music they were playing out across that field
Had the bottom end thumping on the windshield
They know how to make it look fun
Kinda makes you wish you were one

Over and over I wake up with my pillows in my arms

Over and over I wake up with you not in my bed

How I can't get no love without our combination
Killing me, killing me how I get so choked up with every conversation

Justin Nozuka,"I threw a bottle in the air and it smashed into a thousand pieces on the concrete street,
Where the children play in bare feet
We ran as fast as we could, cause I might have woke the neighborhood
Oh I don't feel too good, no I don't feel too good at all
'Cause when the sun comes up and the children wake, get on the street to play,
I'll be the one to blame

I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal

It didn't last too long, no I passed out, woke up and the guilt was gone
Without a care I walk down the stairs, into the kitchen eat my breakfast there
Turn on the television screen,

Little girl crying on the street saying ""glass made my feet bleed""
Oh tell me what am I gonna do
I'm for sure done
What am I gonna do,
I have no choice but to run

I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal
I'm a criminal, I'm a criminal

Change my name and move to Mexico
Dye my hair red and get surgery on my nose
Buy a small condo, stay low in Mexico
Don't it sound so sweet, get a wife and raise a family
Start my own limousine company
Stay low in Mexico
It never snows in Mexico

The deeper I sink

I will never see the light and I will never hear those bells ringing

Would you go or would you stay
Would you go or would you stay

Here in this cozy room just me and you
Cuddling and kissing, making sweet love,
Shooting star wishing and watch the sun come up
And then we'll sleep all day
Meet in our dreams and live life our way
Drop it all off and we'll fly away,
Dip through the stars and wake up slowly

I'm in peace,
I'm in peace,
I'm in peace when I am with you
You set me free; you're all I need,
Lift me off my feet, beauty queen

Where did you find that soul of yours
You must have traveled through heaven, and searched through the garden of love
I swear there's a light, when your eyes touch me
It's like the sun reaching down from the sky
When you touch me with your eyes,
It's like the sun from the sky

I'm in peace,
I'm in peace,
I'm in peace when I am with you
You set me free; you're all I need,
Lift me off my feet, beauty queen

It's uplifting,
Sink into my body while I'm drifting
When you kiss me, really truly kiss me

I'm in peace when I am with you

Justin Nozuka,"I fell in love with a voice in the midnight air,
Gliding across the room she was studying me
Such a simple thing to do
The touch of her hand,
A question 

[Chorus]
If I gave you my life,
Would you let it slip,
Through your fingers like water in the dessert
If I gave you my heart,
In the deep of the night,
Would you hold it like a candle giving you light 

Days fell away into years
Sunset memories
Standing on the edge of it all she was worrying me
Such a typical thing to do
The reach of her hand-
Connection 

[Chorus]

Life fell away from her voice in the midnight air
Lying on the moonlit ground she was looking up at me
Such a simple thing to do
Just as simple as the way she fades away 

[Chorus]",If I Gave You My Life
Justin Nozuka,"Through the water
And through the flames
My baby left me
Without a trace

She took my money
And left the ring
And she didn't leave one clue
Of where she was going to

My baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
My baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

Hey, hey
How could she do it? Break my heart away
When she used to be the one crying when we were apart?
I gave her all of me, gave her my soul
And that was exactly what she stole from me

Well my baby up and left me alone
She signed 'Goodbye' on the letter that she wrote
See, my baby up and left me, now
Mr. Therapy Man, I need to ask you how can I live on?
Live on

'Cause now she stole my heart away, she took my heart
Took my money, she left the ring
She didn't leave one clue

He's not coming home again tonight

It don't make no difference now
Remind me one last time that you won't ever go
Oh the whales can't swim without the tide,
And birds won't fly without the stars in the sky

I can't feel without your touch
I can't dream without your smile
I can't live without your love (Oh Momma)
I cannot fall without your hand
I can't cry without your arms
I can't live without your love (Oh Momma)

Hold me closer than you ever did before

Oh the story of your life
We have all been designed
But you're as real on the outside

Justin Nozuka,"She loves him more
He loves her more,
Seems like they won't ever let each other go,
Laughing and kissing it's a match made in heaven
Behind the rings on their fingers
Imprints the ink deep in the inner
That has stained their souls together now
Stained soul mates forever now
Seems like they've made it to the other side where the grass is greener
And the sky is always blue
And it goes on forever and ever but there is only room for two
Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams,
Next door, yelling cries mercy she is begging please
""Don't end my life you're all I need and darling I will never leave""
And then she prayed on her knees, she said 

[Chorus: x4]
""Save him, save him from the hand he that beats me on"" 

Dark clouds cover her paradise,
She covers her eyes and hides behind enemy lines,
And she walks through the night with her child in her arms
She's thrown back hostage'd
See twenty years ago when she was just ten years old
Lost in imagination she was left alone
And pops had nothing to let his anger on oh he beat her cold
She used to pray on her knees, she said 

[Chorus]

Deep at night I'm awakened from my dreams,
Next door, yelling cries mercy she's begging please,-
""Get up, get up"", he brings her to her feet,
And smacks her down till she falls to the ground
And over and over again,
He brings her to her feet till she can no longer stand -
And still the beating never ends
On and on and on it goes
Until he brings out a gun
And says to her ""stop crying and bring me my son""
She cries harder and harder
He cries harder and harder
She says ""baby please don't do this""
Two shots to her chest
And a blow to his own head
She quickly loses breath and blood rushes to their bed 
And baby cries his eyes out

She loves him more
He loves her more,
Seems like they won't ever let each other go,
Laughing and kissing it's a match made in heaven",Save Him

When you said goodbye
And only you can lift my spirit
You gave me wings and now you're gone

Well I'm crying inside,
A thousand tears every time I think of you
Lock the pictures away,
Hide the letters too,
Anything to get my mind off you

You just walked by me like nothing ever happened
When you said you would rescue me if I was ever falling
Well now baby there's no way that you could have forgotten all of the memories
I thought we shared
We were supposed to grow old

Tell me how can I look up at the moon,
When I know that moon shines upon you
Through that window in your room

Memories of the walks down to the parks
And drawing flowers on the pavement
And sharing double scooped ice-cream
Her favorite flavor was strawberry (yeah yeah)
An empty swing, an empty yard, and empty play house
Her only joy is now gone
And now she's left all alone

The beat of the Drum 
A million Lions roaring 
And on My way to reach the Gate, you take My 
Hand and pull Me in again",Love
Justin Nozuka,"This morning I woke up beside the river.
The grass and trees were green.
Flowers begin growing.
The birds will sweetly sing.
Stronger and much deeper now than ever,
But lying by your side I never feel the stride
I know it's real this time
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is my
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is
The sun falls behind the greatest mountain.
And every moment passing by is a new color in the sky.
Well darling close your eyes.
And now we are flying, we are flying over the mountain.
To follow the sun and back to the river where the evening has won.
Cause my heart is yours
My heart is
My heart is yours
Well my
Ohh now when you look at me it hits me just like a summer breeze.

Hold me close and underneath the moonlight melody.

He said believe in the spirit of god

Justin Nozuka,"There is a King who lives on the top of the hill
There is a king who had everything
Led by a star, the light in the sky
He can't see it

There is a man who lives by the river
He is a man surrounded by light
She is alone bathing in the river
He watches her

[Chorus]
Diamond in the sky
Will she be mine
Lead her through the night
She is blind

Over the hill and beyond the river
Seven unwoken dreams are there
When she awakes she dreams more then ever
He dreams with her

Ooh

Lead her through the night
She is blind",Unwoken Dream (King with Everything)
Justin Nozuka,"My baby is a rebel
She's a rebel I was wrong
In between her hungry trigger 
And her pounding on my wall
I'm reaching up towards the heavens
I'm holding on to hell
You see facing her in heaven 
Would be far worse than the devil himself
I know I'm foolish I know I broke your heart
I also know we can work through this
I'll take you to the stars
We're falling down like rain
I'll hold you at the bay
We're rising up again
We're at the stars again
And how come how come how come

Woman put your weapon down

Well baby you're an angel
I vow that you're the one
I swear that I'm unable to love another one
I'm reaching out for your hand
Baby I'm alone and I'm sinking in your quicksand
Take me back to memory lane
Remember high school remember our first date
You and me in my room you said you felt the same
Making love in spring time
Making love in my mind
Baby you're the reason I'm baby you're the reason",Woman Put Your Weapon Down
Justin Nozuka,"More I need to work 
Get up out your head 
The sun will soon be rising 
The light's no longer red 
We walk the street 
We ain't got time to play 

Standing for our reasons 
Our time has come at last 
To bring it down to bottom 
Let the wind show us the path 
This time we can see 
We ain't got time to play 

Rising comes the moon and the sun 
I'll be alright for now 
A thousand buffalo on the run 
Stand up and fight for now 

Over any distance 
The sun will disappear 
Darkness with its powers 
Taking over anything that fears 
You plant that seed 
The light is on the way 

Not for another moment 
We must not divide 
Harmony is what we need 
Between both you and I wind land and sea 
The light is on the way 

Rising comes the moon and the sun 
I'll be alright for now 
Ten thousand buffalo on the run 
Stand up and fight for now 
Hold my hand I know you're the one

Here inside of my memory, I sing
All around me, hollow men
Chilling at the thought of falling in
Oh my lord, oh my lord

Take me over and under her sun cause I won't be coming back
To Fading stars of death kingdom
No I won't be coming back
Oh my lord, running circles with you love

It's so hard for me to think of you
Here in this dead land, full of death
My heart is beating fast, with tenderness

Oh my love, oh my love
Take me over and under her sun cause I won't be coming back
To Fading stars of death kingdom
No I won't be coming back

Justin Patterson,"I think I see a wagon rutted road
With the weeds growing tall between the tracks, 
And along one side runs a 
Rusty barbed wire fence and beyond there 
Sits an old tar paper shack.

[Chorus]
Mississippi, you're on my mind, 
Mississippi, you're on my mind, 
Mississippi you're on my mind.

I think I hear a noisy old John Deere in a field
Specked with dirty cotton lint, and below the
Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

[Chorus]

I think I smell the honeysuckle vine, 
The heavy sweetness like to make me sick. 
And the dogs, my God, they're hungry all the time 
And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

[Chorus]

I think I feel an angry oven heat, 
The southern sun just blazes in the sky. 
And in the dusty weeds, an old fat grasshopper jumps. 
I wanna make it to that creek before I fry.

Imaginándote extrañándote llamándote

Qué clase problema 
Empezó a gustarme más su amiga que ella

Sé que soy yo el de esa herida permanente

Yo sé que andan velándome 
Primero hable con una 
Y con el tiempo la otra 
Poco a poco fue ganándole 
Tuve que borrar hasta el número de la primera que conocí yo 
Por qué la segunda me tenía gardiado 
Me tenía fichado

Justin Rutledge,"All my city is dressed in skin
Her lips are dark
Her ankles thin
Oh my dizzy ballerina, won't you give us a spin?
My country's cold in autumn's chains
Every time I think of her it rains
When she breathes upon the morning
She shakes all the weather vanes

Now I try to keep a steady hand
Because I'm living in a shaky land
Lord I try to be an honest man
But it's tougher than I ever planned
In the westbound air tonight are those centuries
My tongue-tied beheaded bride
The Alberta breeze

Oh David drive like you've never done
Oh Sarah sing like you've never sung
Oh my dizzy ballerina spin like you've never spun
Now I'm sending you a telegram
About my days in the caravan
With the steers and the bleating lambs
Took the money and away I ran
I recall how the dress you wore rose above your knees
As the thrush flew from the mouth of the Alberta breeze

The summer's turned it's back on me with a sorrow-laden symmetry 
With a highway kind of robbery
Like my life was an apology
Now I don't think about you all the time
Only when the trees sway somehow slaughtered by the Alberta breeze",Alberta Breeze
Justin Rutledge,"Another Shirley Temple,
Another Caine and Able,
There's nothing out the window,
And nothing on the table.

This life is like a sad list 
Strong across the Nation,
If I miss you at the soundcheck,
I'll see you at the station.

There's a beast inside of me,
And he's not bad company
But he speaks in tongues I can never understand,
He says it's one more show and a penny for the band.

Keep everybody dancing,
Keep everybody spending,
I know I am not a good man,
But I can keep pretending.

I made it in a doorway,
Your dress is like a dark vale,
But I'm not going your way,
I'm going back to heartache.

With a bottle of Burgundy,
Where she waits on the balcony,
With a northern wish and a daisy in her hand,
To send me all her love and a penny for the band.

There's a beast inside of me,
And I miss my family,
All these pages and these stages made of sand,
Still, it's one more show and a penny for the band,
One more show and a penny for the band.",A Penny for the Band
Justin Rutledge,"Darling its down to the wire
I'm certain we're stalling
I'd die to come sit by the fire but the curtain is calling
If I were a boat I'd sail to where your beauty could blind me
But I am only a wave
I wait for the blue to bind me
Darling its down to the wire
The mercury's rising
The stars are about to retire upon the horizon
If I were a boat I'd name our love after an ocean
But I am only a wave and this is my only motion
I hear them playing our songs in lands where shadows are long
In places we used to be strong they're playing our song
Are you afraid?
Yes, I'm afraid
Are we alone?
Yes, I'm afraid we're alone
Darling its down to the wire
The fire's a forest
I can't tell the chord from the choir
The choir from the chorus
If I were a boat I would anchor my labors inside you
But I am only a wave
I dream but to drown beside you
I hear them playing our song
Wisteria clinging to dawn
In places we used to belong they're playing our song
I hear them playing our song long after the embers are gone
In places our love was all wrong they're playing our song
Are you afraid?
Yes, I'm afraid
Are we alone?

Where the windows are always broken
I am a pause in a storm on a dark stair

Be the coward or the kiss
Be a man about this

Somewhere there is salt
In the air of a season
That touches the hem
Of an island so northern
Some air is knitting a day for a woman
Who's eyes are upon the horizon

Be a man about this
Be the boredom or the bliss
Be a man about this

Be the number or the name
Be the picture or the frame
Be the shoulder or the shame
Be the moth or flame

Sometimes they give, sometimes they pass by
It's the random falling as the wheel of fortune spins
And home is wherever they take you in

The chemical wind burned you to the bone
And when you came back, you were not the same
It took the kindness of strangers to bring you in

Because home is wherever they take you in

Chris, you were gone, out on the edge
These things that destroy are inside of ourselves
It's always the kindness of strangers to wash away these
Sins
Because home is wherever they take you in",Home

We were standing shoulder to shoulder, Billy McCann and I
Our faces ruddy and burning as we stared into the flames
But I know now the things that we saw that night were not the same 

And I see you as I walk away, standing by your barricade
It's all over now between us, Billy McCann goodbye

So we'll sit up at the bar for the last time the way we used to do
And I'll toast the love that you showed me and the faith I gave to you
And we can drive out and watch the sunrise from the top of the Glenshane Pass
And I won't make you answer the questions I've always tried to ask

And I see you as I walk away standing by your barricade
And though you never will forgive me, Billy McCann goodbye",Drummy B

Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mami that place isn't worth your tears
(Oh, oh)

I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Girl you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me
(Woo)

Try to change what you can
And accept all the things you cannot
(Don't stress yourself baby)
I know you want to fly away from the world

Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby I know just what you need
(I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea

It hurts me to watch you sing the blues
(It hurts me baby)

The way I'm lookin' at you whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny
It feel good right?
Listen

I kind of noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

See people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl

Ma, what chu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""how the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a alike
You have me sleepin in the same bed every night

Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots let it burn in your chest
We could ride down pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number 3, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (hey!)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I

Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (hey!)
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance",Like I Love You
Justin Timberlake,"Would have given up my life for you
Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face

Lookin' in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do was apologize
You didn't say you're sorry

I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me

You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me again

Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine
Loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it

But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man

That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me

Wish like Hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late
Its over now

You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me

And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough

Never get to love me",Never Again
Justin Timberlake,"I was just walking that day aimlessly
(Oh, oh no)
You picked a perfect day to bump into me
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason we still met at your store
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

All my friends meet you and say you're the one
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
You had a friend but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads
Please move on with me
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
And that's the way to His kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1

There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green

There's nothin' else in this world
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?

I've been asking everybody what they think
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatums for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'mma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatums or me that's no fun

Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind

So baby tell me what you're doing later on

Too late now her friend, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her, not me

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my

Running fast in my mind

If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should arrive

Or hasn't it been found?

Justin Timberlake,"The beautiful days are long gone
And I can't seem to breathe
Feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from me

Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
I still think of you that way
You should know that

The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights
They don't mean a thing
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right
Without you here with me

Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know
It's hard for me to say
You were my soul

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same

'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
I thought that you would never do me that way

But even after all I still think of you that way
Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways

But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain
Now love is a game that we both like to play
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stay

Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl, you know me inside out
And I can't get you off of my mind
And I could say that I don't love you no more

And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways

No matter what I'm going through
Lately I've been questioning myself
Am I good enough for you?

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love
You've got me questioning (yeah)
Got me wondering (yeah, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

I know that there'll be times when I'll be miles away
And you'll be all alone
I constantly fight my insecurities
When I can't reach you by phone

And, oh, Lord knows that I'm only human
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions
I know that you truly love me but
Fear has me second-guessing

I kind of noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face will change

If you smile then that should set the tone

And if you let go the music should groove your bones

See people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'

About the way I'm feeling

Sick and tired of trying to save the world
I just want to spend my time with you, girl
And what you're give me lets me know

You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool
In so many ways
But I would change my life
If you thought you might try to love me

So please give me another chance
To write you another song
Take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again

I'm not a saint
I'm just a man
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just

Please, give me another chance
To write you another song
Take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over again

Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again

Tennessee, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Three 6 Mafia

Tennessee
VA, dirty south, dirty south
It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do
Project shit what

I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around, and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends, and y'all can come to the back, oh, oh

Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh

And when I call, don't give me the run around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl
There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but, girl, you don't hear me

You're kinda cute
Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around?
If you gotta problem, baby, I can hold ya down

I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby make your first wish
You the party, baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless

So grab your friends and let's take it back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(Parental discretion is advised) Oh, oh

Y'all can be the star in my freaky spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me

See, girl, you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags

Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?""
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey

Hi, my name is Bob, and I work at my job
I make forty-something dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Till I started to lose my way

It all goes back to when I dropped out of school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See, I can't put down the pipe

And it's breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around
And my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I would have done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See, I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is
I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes

And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down

It sends her on a trip so right
She might be going home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's going home with me tonight

Justin Timberlake,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Interlude)

But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly
Friends so fly I can go fly private, 'cause I handle mine
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

Tennessee, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Three 6 Mafia

Tennessee
VA, dirty south, dirty south
It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do
Project shit what

I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around, and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends, and y'all can come to the back, oh, oh

Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne?
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh, oh

And when I call, don't give me the run around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl
There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but, girl, you don't hear me

You're kinda cute
Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around?
If you gotta problem, baby, I can hold ya down

I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby make your first wish
You the party, baby I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless

So grab your friends and let's take it back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(Parental discretion is advised) Oh, oh

Y'all can be the star in my freaky spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me

See, girl, you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together, you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags

Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Yeah ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, ""How you do me this way?""
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab playa on these streets, I'm tryin' to holla at ya
Quit playing games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town

I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
(Is it good, is it good?) And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessey

Justin Timberlake,"Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out it's glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor

So long till you get off from work
But listen I got some better positions for you to take in for so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, you should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya
Girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know
I’ll keep a secret for ya
I'm trying to ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in
Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl what difference does it make if it was there, it's mine
You the girl that's gonna be there when it's marrying time
And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Say this is a private show, oh boy don't start
Keep it soul stripping things slipping like a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O.
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching our every single move like casinos

It's a cabaret
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
Cause even though I'm a professional
I like to do my work at home
Cabaret
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You giving me everything you got
All I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)

Justin Timberlake,"Bitter sweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake

Running men is looking on, why
Why don't you come out to play

Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love, please be slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage

Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain
Side show in front of the whole crowd

Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next to it
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out something might go down
Good I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you speak regular it's freaky girl, I say OK
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level

Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Oh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder

You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I'll be down and throw it at that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chic
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better, better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down to go to that level

You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo

If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Told yah, ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms
That bomb, that P
It's a problem call the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's

And she put me in a meditation state
Her skin was white so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
And it's time for feeding and her body waits
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

Aw, give it to me now
So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor
She comes alive when your appearing
Hungry for some more

I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say

Now I feel my fever on the rise
In my bones and my body starts to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried
Find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate

So evil in your dress
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh
Once you start to invoke her spirit
Got you on the floor

I start to seem like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle

The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle

Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

Well, come on honey why don't you

Sweet and loving but now I know

Give me through the night

To take the nights alone.
Just when I'd lost the need
To have someone to hold me.
I saw you standing there
Across the room
From me and I said:
Here we go
Here we go again.

Now I like to think that
I'm no fool in love.
I can't help but feel as though
I play one every time.
But what with your eyes of blue
Is a man to do,
But fall at first glance.
Say here we go
Here we go again.

Now you could just walk away
And make this easier
On the both of us.
But I can see it in your face,
Your mind's already made
Up.

And so you cross the room
And I'll never forget
The way you moved
Just like a whisper in the wind.
And as you drew close to me
You gently reached
Out and took my hand.

Here we go again.""

Here we go again.",Here We Go Again

Well you say you love me and deep inside hell I know you do
So stop your crying now 
I'm already convinced that someday I'll be forgiven for this

Yeah, and if I know you
You won't have nothing to say
You'll just clear the tears from your eyes 
Long enough to watch me walk away
You won't curse or scream, no nothing that obscene
You'll just tell yourself you never loved me anyway

So tonight when you leave
Put the light out on the porch
Take anything that you want to keep and leave your key in the door
And I don't want to hear you crying no tears that show regret

Cause someday you'll be forgiven for this

Maybe I said some things I shouldn't
Maybe I caused a scene 
Maybe I broke myself a promise
That I never meant to keep

It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time

The first time I found love 
Lord I was young and I was mean
And I took just what I wanted 
From that pretty little thing

And I never told her that I loved her
I could see the want in her eyes
The last time that I saw her
Is when we waved goodbye that night

It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time
It won't be the last time

Now when I was young 
I was dumb and I was crazy
Now I'm getting old
And I feel this world closing in on me

On a Sunday mornin' sidewalk
Just wishing Lord that I could sleep
I got my hands down in my pockets
Cause I'm shakin' like a leaf

Justin Townes Earle,"Has she been around tonight?
Give a call if she should happen by
Cause it's been at least a week,
Since last time I've seen her
White dress, white shoes, and white gardenias

Maybe she went back to Baltimore
Bet she packed her bags the night before
Took a taxi down to Lex and 44th
Caught the first train to Baltimore
'Cause long ago she left her heart there
'Cause she could not stop the bleeding

White dress, white shoes, and white gardenias
I don't know, where she goes when she leaves
And I don't know, where she stays or whom she sees
So if you see her out tonight,
Yeah just look her in the eye

But you'll know it when you see her

Whether you'll love me, baby
Whether you'll love me

Now the wind is picking up
Pressures comin' on, now
I seek shelter through a, through a burstin' storm

Just two fools out in the rain
Just happy to be together now
Just two strangers at the bus stop
Talkin' bout the weather

Worried, worried 'bout the weather
Whether you'll love me
Whether you'll love me, baby

It don't take a twister to break a home
No it don't take a night to feel like you in the dark and on your own
Now the range is starry but the river's bound to rise
There you stand on your side, baby
There I stand on mine baby

Forecast ahead well it just don't look bright
Scattered thunderstorm, winds from the west
Make a day feel like one long night
Now there's no use waiting
For the weather will be changed tonight,
Or it might change tomorrow
It might never, never be the same

Standing in the kitchen where the sun comes through the curtains
Wondering what this day’s gonna bring me
Yesterday I felt so much more than I feel now
Standing in the window with my heart bleeding out
They say the world keeps turning, ah but still I have my doubts
Because I don’t know what to believe

And but day and night, change and uncertainty

What can I say, what will I have to show?
I’ll be remembered for the love I made or everything I stole
Now the sun is going down and I’ll be damned if it don’t look like snow
But the heavens on me hold no guarantee

But day and night, change and uncertainty

Have to hold my arms length
Gathering things I find down around my feet
Once my back was strong
Now I’m on my knees
My pockets are filled
With broken and worthless things
So no more words, nah there’s nothing left to say
I’ve learned through love and I can’t live with the pain

Don’t know why I let you treat me like this

""K Sera Sera,"" whatever will be will be

A li'l rhyme...

Check it out on the one, two, three...

Standin' 5'11"", and I'm almost 6 feet
18 years old, rock a new beat
Got no nickname, stay the cool sane
Kick the same rhymes, play the same games
To watch my back, but ain't no vics here
Bring in the new--that tune was last year
In strode the baby brother, comin' from the mind school
Flow from blue Bic, and paper's wide-ruled
If I had a penny for every note that I played
Or if I had a dollar for every bar I create
I guess that I would reckon, ""By golly, I'm gettin' paid""
Or better yet, ""I reckon it's time to be gettin' paid!""
So I sit and think, ""Well, should I pull my Plan 9?""
I'll leave it up to the powers and the stars
Since I'm from the cosmos of another planet, see
I believe my karma will guide me to my destiny
So I flow, not on the rhymes
But related to my shade of mind, or, rather, vibes
Que sera sera, what will be will be
Whatever's kinda clever, what the future holds for me
I guess it's just a thought, though my mind is kinda hazy
My name is Justin, baby

I got my skullcap on, then the flow from my mind starts
As I rip for days from the land of the mic arts
Cream of the crop, a cool, blue beatnik
Blessed with the gift, and now it's time to kick the ill shit
Love to eat the scallops, and quit with the doo-doo raps
Stay away from ill crack, listen to the Fatback
Smooth on a rough track, time to catch a catnap
If you are my brother, I'll be sure to give you much dap
Ya bound to get your head smacked, if you try to illjack
Get your kit from Acme, set yourself an ill trap
I used to talk of vickin', would step and finger-lickin'
But now my mic endeavors have improved over time
Oh yeah, I'm still the same brother who has got to pickin'
So listen to the moody groove, piano, and the vibes

Ahh, and ya don't stop. Yeah, ya know, yeah
And we the sure shit, guaranteed to be the ultimate
Ya got to keep it on to the break-of-dawn
To the rhythm, y'all, ya don't stop
And ya don't quit, ya don't stop
Ya gotta keep on, keep the flow on
And, baby, ya know you and the rhythm is always on
And I'm out...",K Sera Sera

All your doing to me 

Chorus ",Inside Your Mind
justincase,"I took a ride in the back seat of her car
We stopped at the corner to see the local bar
I saw them dance and sing all their lovely song
And I asked myself ""Why aren't you smiling, what's wrong?""
It's got something to do with not having it all together
It's got something to do with not having it all together 

[Chorus:]
It was something good she left behind
It was something pure she changed my mind
It was something good she let me find
I always get behind and I'm leavin' mine 

Now that I drive so slow I can't get hurt 
A rear end is much better than a head on heart
I keep my mirror in focus and my head high
Just in case I see you with the girl in the sky
It's got something to do with not having it all together
It's got everything to do with not being all together 

[Chorus]
Give me Give me enough to know 
Give me Give me that something's right
Give me Give me enough to know 
Give me Give me I'll sleep the night 

[Chorus]",It Was Something
justincase,"Here is the letter that gives
My reasons we can't be together
You know that I don't want to hurt you
I just think it's for the better
So take your time 'cause it's alright
I'm finally leaving
Just know I've thought all about it
And written down all of my reasons 

I just find, there's things you were used to that I never could do
I did try, but that's not how I live 

Chorus:
I don't care anymore
If you think that I was in the wrong
Sometimes things don't work out
You know that it's time you moved on 

Somewhere between nice to meet you
And we're better apart
I lost the will to see you
The way that I did at the start 

I just find, there's things you were used to that I never could do
I did try, but that's not how I live

justincase,"Snow is falling across the streetlights
It's nothing I can change
Summer left me and I wish you hadn't
Before you took the chance to say
All the things you didn't say

But they just don't shine
Since you went away

Tell me am I a fool?
Thinking that you
Needed me there
Maybe I'm wrong
I don't belong
Acting as if I knew

All the things that I miss now like I miss you
And I wonder what you're thinking
And I wonder what you're doing now
I wonder if the same things that got me down
Are getting you down 

Who knows maybe I'm to blame for hanging all my faith
On yesterday

What I, what I, what I wouldn't do
To wipe all that pain away
What I, what I, what I wouldn't do
To walk the road you've walked along
If you looked here
Would it be too much to ask
If you looked where you have been glancing past
All those boys who
Have been here for you
What I, what I, what I wouldn't do 

Peel the layers and take your test this moment
Hold your head high and stare down all the twisted

Even though you're used to leaving things
I just want to be the last one gone

Just know that I'm with you
And what you feel
I feel it too

[Chorus]
I'm feeling lately
I'm going crazy
Wondering how I'll go on without you
I keep on trying
Slowly dying
Thinking about how I need you here with me

I wear your shirt
The scent of you
Reminds of the night that we became two
There's nothing else 
That feels the same
Everyday there's sun, it feels just like rain

Just know that I'm with you
And what you feel
I feel it too

Well, you're wrong
Sometimes I'm weak and baby you know
I'm not that strong

And I'm in L.A.
There's so much to tell you
Words I need to say
But your phone keeps ringing

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.

Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Juvenile,"I'm a nigga from the third with a helluva nerve
And if you cross my line then you will get served
I win, lose or die this happens everyday
Muthafuckas get killed in this game I play

I put these hands on a nigga 'cuz he talk too much
He told my business to a bitch, I had to fuck him up
When I confronted this nigga, he got highly upset
Took off his shirt, booted up, then looked down to my chest

So I slammed his ass, the nigga started to kick
I went to stompin' in his face, fuckin' up his shit
Gave him a good ass whippin', then I started to steppin'
I saw him reachin' in his pants, I seen he was stressin'

The niggas was stuntin' but I had mine
Five times through the chest, family outside cryin'
On the way back home, I saw this sharp ass lady
Polo down, hair fixed and some gold earrings

I asked just where she's headed, she said, ""7th Ward""
Release the fine bitch out the St. Bernard
She hopped in the ride, I take the hoe to Popeye's
Got a three piece white, cold drink and small fries

The hoe got full, we went to the Rochambeaux
Took off her clothes and bust three nuts and after that I was through
Took her halfway home and told the bitch, ""Get on""
Didn't give a fuck about her 'cuz I gave her the bone

Everyday somebody else will get, hung by the gaffler
Niggas roll down the ave. 'cuz I'm the neighborhood amp
Fuckin' around with the Juvenile and you get your brains blown out
'Cuz that's what livin' all up the project is all about

Was the man that killed lil Lanny, who knew we'd understand it
That way that, my mother was heartless to her kids
So he took us in his home, and he raised like his own
Now we grown, and we learned responsibility,
The devil tryed to get wit me
To affect all of my dickin' inability
But it's gon' be some shit, when a collision is occurin'
Asurin', of me bein' a factor, through '97 and after
And I'ma have to, get my ten percent
Or I'ma get punished, like the rest of these niggaz and there's evidence
'Cause ever since all these cars and all these mansions, and all these
luxuries was givin'
You wasn't givin' no thanks, to the reason you was livin'
So I'ma keep an open mind and make the right decision
And ain't tell you niggaz shit, and put my self in a position
That's unescapable, 'cause you capable, of puttin' my life in danger
And it's causin' confusion, confusion draw conclusion
And shootin' up some niggaz that pose a threat
Until somebody warns you that you're close to death

All that trick shit I stopped it

We see them workin' on somethin' look here we riders
Ain't like workin' niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too

Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that

Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'

You think this shit happened for me over tha night
This is my life
Everybody know I be on tha flight
To get it right, and keep it right, and stay strong
Nigga thought it wouldn't happen to 'em, but all of 'em dead wrong
Singin' tha same song, sayin', ""Juvie ain't shit!""
With a project nigga out here tellin' people he rich.""
When tha truth is:  they wishin' they was in my shoes
I pay dues, with them pistols I made moves
And I'm seein' all these pussy-ass niggas tryin' ta be hard
Why ya fuckin' with mines?  I ain't fuckin' with y'all
Tha people runnin' your organization workin' for me, uh-huh
You didn't know that, now you call for tha plea
Boy, think of all tha places you could possibly be

Was tryin' ta holla at a nigga... talkin' some bullshit
I told her, ""If ya fuck everybody it's all gravy.""
She didn't say nothin', she stood there lookin' at me crazy
Then she got mad, and called me bitches and motherfuckers
I waited 'til I got by the door, reached back and stuck her
She did what any bitch woulda did, and got the law for me
Talkin' 'bout gonna press charges and get her pa for me
I told him, ""When I get outta jail, I'ma beat ya awfully
and open up fire at your pa to back him up off of me.""
All she wanted to do was scream out ""Juvie""
While I hit her from tha back and smack her on tha booty
Bite tha titties, get tha head, break tha bed
Pull off tha rubber and bust a nut on her leg
Some of these hoes be tellin' me,"" I'm just an admirer.""

It's real, nigga
Too real
Pay attention even though I'm young, nigga
Look, look
This one here's on tha up, dog
For all my people with bad luck, dog
Strugglin', tryin' ta make a buck, dog
For all tha peeps who ain't with us, dog
For all my niggas in Angola, stay tough, dog
See, this from shorty on tha real
I'm tired of seein' my niggas gettin' killed
They hustlin' for a mil, nigga, hustle for your bills
If ya think ya need help, holla at me, wodie, I'm trill
If I got it ta spend, then I got it ta kill
But listen, man.. I know ya see tha ice glistenin', man
I know it make you want to go get it bad
But ya gotta think 'fore ya move, partna
'Cause it'll make your ship sink and you will lose, partna
I know you hate ta take it from a young nigga like me
But I betcha can't name one nigga like me
That's why I'm tryin' ta preach, my nigga
And teach, my nigga
If ya don't work ya don't eat, my nigga

(Chorus 2x [Juvenile])
They got a million and one things that you could be doin'
Than hangin' around this motherfucker talkin' to your children
Get off your ass, lil' daddy, and go and get it
It's starin' at ya right in your face, you ain't wit it

[Juvenile]
Look at ya, you're fuckin' up and I can tell it too
What is ya smokin'? Everything a nigga sellin' you?!
I know you could do better than that, and deserve more
Ya use to be tight with your game back in '84
All tha hoes use ta jock ya
Niggas use ta knock ya
Stay a big shot, motherfucker couldn't stop ya
Then ya went ta runnin' 'round tha project with them junkies
Holes in your shoes, and your body all funky
Lips all ashy, eyes popped out
Spendin' your children check, takin' food out they mouth
And you get mad with me 'cause I don't want to give you ten
I don't support your habit, nigga, y'all grown men
I got kids ta feed, I got bills ta pay
I got people comin' askin' for shit everyday
I can't please everybody, but I love my folks
If I give ya everything, baby, I'ma be broke

(Chorus 2x)

[Turk]
Look... look.. look
Where I stay, times is hard for a lot of my peeps
Some of my rounds doin' bad.. can't even much eat
Everytime I pass through, beggin' me for a dollar
Thinkin' I owe them somethin', don't even want to holla
Nigga who use ta be ballin' ain't ballin' no mo'
I can see they life fadin' away slowly for sure
Niggas who I come up with get me full of that dope
Use ta care about theyself, ain't care no mo'
Niggas want me ta help 'em.. ain't helpin' theyself
You must be out your mind if you ain't helpin' yourself
Ain't no love loss... I just gotta stay my distance
Gotta keep my mind straight.. before I come up missin'
Gotta do my rap thing, and make my paper, mister
Ain't gon' let nobody stop me from gettin' my six figures
Gettin' my shine on, bling-blingin' everyday
If you're not for tha right, stay tha fuck out my way, nigga

(Chorus 2x)

[B.G.]
Everytime I hit tha block, it look like it get worse
Make me wonder if V.L. and Magnolia got a curse
My niggas still my niggas... got love for 'em all
I hate to see that market ride they back and make 'em fall
Somebody tell me, if I didn't have change and I was broke
Would I get tha same attention when I'm in tha next four-door
No, I don't think so, I'll be a equal nigga
On the set, smokin' jo's, beggin' people for scrilla
On the reala... if I could do it, then you could
Lay your hustle down and make your way out the hood
Ain't nobody gon' give no hand-outs, I swear
Ain't nobody gon' pay tha bills in your house, I swear
They don't care, ya gotta stand on your own, my nigga
You ain't no child, look in tha mirror, you're grown, my nigga
Do yourself a favor: leave tha heroin alone, my nigga
And get your hustle on, nigga, get it on, my nigga

(Chorus 4x)

[Juvenile talking]
Man, you could be out here tryin' ta do somethin', man
I mean everytime we come through, man, I do somethin' for my people, man
I give tha little kids a dollar or so, ya know what I'm sayin'

Back and forth to keys, but the Lil Weezy handle purchase

Wodie, c'mon and get your skull cracked, tryin' to erase me

Beside he know what I did and they got evidence 
And I'm not about to play with them people intelligence 
Muthafuckaz try to stay  peep me at my residence 
Chargin' me for homicide  they say it was negligent 
Fuck it  I'ma accept my lick when it come to me 
Now let me see how many of these bitches gon' run for me 
Shit, my breath funky with a migraine headache 
Big pissed off cause I know I made a mistake 
But that's what I get fuckin' with pussy ass niggaz 
And 2 dollar hoes that'll trade you for cash figures 
They did that. but I got a way to get 'em back 
Not with the police though Juve ain't no rat 
Nigga tell me shit I done fallen for the end 
And you woulda had that dick look when you'd caught that 10 

Chorus: Juvenile (2x) 
You gon' take 'em (Five) 
Are you gon' take that shit to trial 
And gon' deny it 
Violate probation when you just got caught, with that ride 
That alibi ain't gon' work 
Ain't it some hotter niggaz from out that 3 be doin' that dirt 

Juvenile: 
All the money in the world can't even move you 
Your lawyers tryin' to fuck you, the judge tryin' to do you 
The district attourney don't give a fuck about y'all 
Cause he gotta run run for office again in the fall 
So everything he cross examine he tryin' to fuck over 
Brothers on his shoulder, tryin' to read his quota 
You wastin' ya time boy when you wastin' they time 
Cause they'll start off with a nickel and try and give you a dime 
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin KC 
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin Ducky 
Both of my niggaz just cam home from doin' a bit 
Both of my niggaz know what encarceration is 
Lil Daddy, you fightin' a war you can't win 
Your guilty as charged soon as them people stand up in 
So accept ya lick, you got caught with more than a brick 
And you ain't gon see the streets 'til two-thousand and six 

Chorus: Juvenile (2x) 

Juvenile: 
It's sharks out here boy, niggaz be rattin' 
You be up in penitentiary and don't know what happened 
Law, you're tellin' me you're wanted for murder and kidknappin' 
Short on they information so they lyin' and scrappin' 
You don't want to be in jail that ain't you're place 
When your child graduate you gon' look her in the face 
Tell her lil wodie out there hustlin' somewhere across the nation 
All in the projects, take that probation 
Believe it or not, you be up in the cell block 
Far away from home where you can't eeven sell rocks 
Bitches ain't on your side like up in the bricks 
Cause once you up in the jailhouse they searchin' for that dick 
Sco' no, cho' no, I'm single 
My man up in jail, I can still mingle 
I'm my own woman, fuck who, what, or when 
My man can't whip me, cause he doin' ten

Juvenile,"[Juvenile]
I'ma stay thuggin, how I came is how I leave
When I say somethin, best believe that's how it be
Motherfuckers, too - yeah I said it, nigga, I mean it
Bitch was dressed in gangsta and switch, wodie, I seen it
One of these Juvie-fuckin' hoes gon' get you caught up
Me, I wear ReeBoks and Girbauds, and play it smarter
If them boys in tha ben, they go bluckahda on tha block
I'ma be gettin' somewhere, your ass gonna get shot
You paid 1500... I paid 5999
Got diamonds and Rolexes that shine at tha same time
I ain't scared... but I ain't dumb, and I ain't stupid
I know how ta survive in tha project and how ta do shit
If I hit a hustle I ain't tellin' tha biz
'Cause tha witness will tell them people who tha murderer is
Your main man'll put four or five to your wig
Take tha Coke can and throw you off the side of the bridge
Gotta be able to think, gotta know when to move out
Gotta read through the lines, gotta know what these hoes 'bout
Gotta separate your business from your family and friends
Gotta bust a nigga head if he plottin to do you in
I done did dirt, so I know what's tha consequences
Let my shit burst, tryin' ta knock out a nigga denchures
Always keep cool to see through these fools
Cause we do the shit that people see on the news
So, follow me now into a world of stress
Where wodie tryin' ta get it all 'cause he don't settle for less
Ain't satisfied 'til all of his beef is put to rest
Slangin' that iron... with a soldier rag on his neck
And credit for they people in case they want to connect
He ain't hidin'.. he still ridin'.. in the 'jects
He gotta be willin' to play tha game 'til his death
Nigga bangin'.. hit you in your brain, now who next
I be cool at all times and acknowledge.. when I'm wrong
Shit I went through when tha Feds got my game real small
I'm not tha smartest motherfucker walkin
But I can tell a fake motherfucker when he talkin
My daddy always told me, ""Boy, don't be a follower
You got a lot of pride, but some you need to swallow up
You keep that attitude, you won't see tomorrow, bruh""
I soak it up, and got better as a hustler

[Lil' Turk]
I'm a head buster, a straight up Nolia nigga
Young thugger
Fuck up, I show ya, nigga, that I don't play
Keep a K for protection
With fifty... never run without my weapon
I stand out here, tie ducked with bandanas
I show no fear, what'chu 'bout we can handle
I'm real as they came, a untamed guerrilla
'Bout bustin' your brains, whoever be wit'cha
I have no pics, I split your shit
Whoever you with, I'ma split they shit
Ya steal or get stole, wet or get wet
Bust or get bust on, move a chest or lose a chest
Try not to miss when you cock back and shoot
You shoot and miss, then it's all on you
Ain't no game, it's real dog, live or ya die
Real in tha field, dog, ya live or ya die
Even though I'm a lil' bitty nigga
Look, I got big nuts and they hang low, nigga
I ain't scared ta bust
Want beef, let me know.. and look, we can tear this bitch up
You or me.. me or you.. gon' bite tha dust
Wuz up, nigga
Wuz up, nigga
You afraid, go ta church, I ain't scared at all
Lose your head, fuck with Turk, 'cause I'm knockin' it off
I'ma keep my hands clean, ride for some change
Niggas gon' ride for me, niggas that's untamed
Niggas who bang that heroin, or snort that cocaine
Niggas out that project don't mind sprayin' thangs

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do

Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

[Verse 3: Baby]
I'm on a mission lil' daddy
Put this paint on the caddy
Nigga ridin threw the hood and we blowing on candy
Stay G'd up from my head to my feet
I was raised in the 3rd that's the heart of the streets
Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggaz stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin
I hold my hood down for the shit that I'm driving
Nigga thug to death, remember the projects

I'm a man who ventures out on his own
Long as I don't bring no diseases or no ho's back home

Let me roam, you don't even much need that phone
I'ma take care of my shit, baby, ,just leave that alone

'Cept them three twenty's that Slim had, Slim!
See I'm cut broke, in a skit mask

Well, then lose the number, do me a favor
I ain't a life guard, I can't be your savior
You met me like this, Im'a be a playa

You still want to ex me or try to disrespect me
Now them ho's in your ear, got you trippin' wanna test me
Look, meet me on Freret Street, right where my set be
Go home, pack all your shit and drop off them Vette keys

I'm not asthmatic I'm healthy and I could fuck
That teenage pussy I don't want so zip it up
And no satchatories having in here so catch a cut
Ohh how I love it when half your ass show
And you catch the side view it look like two elbows
And my dick stuck to my leg like velcro
Stop blocking and let them females go

Should have followed you first ma and snatch you first
But when I'm drinking everyboady look like they got worth
I don't need to tell a woman what I'm worth
She gonna show me some affection when I raise my shirt
I ain't never bought a woman where I do my dirt
To a nice confined spot where I can lift that skirt
Hopefully she illegal with the head and all
Probably heard of my background and said I'm a dog
But I ain't about me baby it's about y'all
My fantasy is knocking four of y'all off

We be popping exctasy looking for woman to hug

So don't be telling me nothing about no babies
You trying to give me a charge you must be crazy

I don't know why you making people think I got you swell
You better quit it before one of my bitches pop you hoe
I know your baby daddy he ain't got no flow
You may be into playing games but its gone stop here though
You want more than a fuck, you just trying to tie a nigga up
Like my last bitch, I blew a lot of money on her
I met her, fast pace, lil mama hard for me to slow down
Why the sad face after the results come around?
You want a nigga to play daddy? Should have asked me
I would have gladly told you that I have me
When you met me you told me you wanted a gangsta to hit
Without the wisdom of knowing I'm off the chain with this shit
Now your feelings done got involved and you ain't glad with a fuck
And you wonder why all the players keep on passing you up
Look Juve ain't going through that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this

You got a fat ass, your chest right, and you dress right
But would I fuck without a rubber? You're thinking I just might

But I'm in the playoffs, you be scheming all day, hoe take a day off
Find another target this one you need to stay off
Your looking for a reputation ? I'ma give ya one
Don't be trying to give me a charge ? nothing a nigga done
As far as I'm concerned that baby can be for anyone
Not til you entered the party there wasn't any fun
It's not me it's the attention I draw
To make these bitches fill out paper work and lie to the law
It's obvious she want to ride in the driver's seat of my car
Taking the lotteries to get some properties from a star
Look Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone late you put your babies on me I mean this

They be like look at his lips, look at her eyes and her ears
Mama said ""If I don't approve it, the baby not his""
She said she not gone keep all that (?) with kids
Keep playing mama said she saw 380 ya did
I saw the grin on your face the moment I saw you in court
Wish I would have saw your face when the test was exposed
This ain't your first time you done did before
Your not even gonna have a vagina no more
You're making accusations you ain't sure bout
You had a chance to be a queen but still you chose to whore out
Don't even speak you ain't no friend cause you an enemy now
Niggaz knowing you ain't the hoe you pretend to me now
You done caught a maybe-baby, move you're whoring and drama
You needs to try to focus on your daughter lil mama
Look cause Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this

I made a vow to myself that I would never go broke

I probably can't play no sports but I can work these streets

He gotta be in too much 'bout everything that he touch
Out of the roof money get packed up and moved in the truck
Kill me if you feel I ain't worthy
I inherited skills from murky niggaz that's as real as my Saints jersey
I stand here posted in the worst of times
Knowing niggaz after me, gonna rehearse my grind
I'm not a prophet, but I could teach you how to cock it and pop it
And how to put some money in your pocket
You see something you like go 'head and cop it
But watch it, niggaz gone knock it
Trying to get you for your paper when them bitches is jockin'
You might do lil' daddy like that, but this is not him
Don't look for your people to help you, my niggaz done shot them
My people done told me I could roll
I got a reputation for beating niggaz and hoes
Stickin' to the G code, 'tees, 'rees, and 'bows
Pop a Ex, smoke a blunt, if you believe it then Whoa!

Whoa! I got to get it Lil Daddy, I got to have it Lil Daddy

I'm way over the top with mines

Poor niggaz be eating pork, rich niggaz be eating steak
I'ma get me a Porterhouse nigga, you just wait
You couldn't step on my toes if you was standing 6' 8""
It's mister 400 bitches so get that shit straight
You better talk to your hoe 'fore I put dick in her face
Look, I'm wild Magnolia, she better get in her place
I ain't a law abiding citizen, I gets ignorant
I got a trail of niggaz telling cops what I did to them
I ain't lookin for no poppers, ain't looking for no partners
I'm looking for mo' choppers to get rid of mo' problems
All I got is my ball and my words
My momma, my daddy, my chil'ren, my gun, and my herb
Shit, they got a lot of killers I know
But ain't too many gon' make it to see 2004, whoa!

[Verse 3]
I tried to play the backround as mcuh as I could
Cause all the big mouth niggaz be gettin knocked in the hood
Remember them lil' niggaz? they done grew up now
So 'ret street and marching turned into a clocked up dump
We scam on shit because we love that sound
We not concerned about waiting unitl the night come 'round
Hey lil' mama I'm a gorilla, let me pipe that down

I got old timers paying close attention to me
I could get your shit split for the minimum fee (yeah)
Fucking with them niggaz, got a ten for a ki'
Got a few princess cuts on the watch and the piece
I'll put it on your ass for a profit, capiche?

Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could [Incomprehensible] light stars

She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids

And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up

Wonderin' how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus

They're not about the camouflage, the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody, I just make sure I pay homage

Hey shorty, this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back

But I'm still blingin' and showin' off my toys in this bitch

Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names

Look here, I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it, 'bout to get another deal

Put your sister brother mammy and your pa on the curb

What next? We tryin to bring it back to the team 
Let our dogs see how it is to do your own thing 
Not like Baby though, really put your own bling 
You ain't doin nuttin for me nigga, do your own thing 

[Chorus] 

[Juvenile] 
G shit to 'em, I don't just write rhymes 
Goin platinum offa talkin about my lifetimes 
I'm gettin love in these streets cause they like how I rock 
I'm just a thug on the beat, fuck a hip-hop cop 
Not jumpin on the bandwagon to get my props 
Got somethin happenin fo' me right within my block 
Now, everybody wanna be the king of somethin 
I guess I'll just call myself the king of hustlin 
I make things happen nigga, I'm a panhandler 
Shit not like how it's lookin on camera 
Won't exercise the right to put the bandana up 
And nobody gon' handle us, we never put they hammers up 
You couldn't make it where I survive 
Right now my city murder rate is at it's all time high 
And it's a must I have the piece in sight 
When I'm drivin know I'm showin them no teeth, just eyes

That's right, it's crunch time now fellas
No time to be cryin for momma now, it's the movement
C'mon

To all my people on them corners I consider as dogs
I wish I could break a package down and send it to y'all
I know ya feelin me behind them penitentiary walls
Put me on the visit list and I'll be in to see y'all
Talk to 'em - your mayor ain't your friend, he's the enemy
Just to get your vote, a saint is what he pretend to be
Fuck him! Ah-listen to me, I got the remedy
Save your money up and find out who got 'em for 10 a ki'
Bubble, if you don't hustle don't use your energy
Cause you gon' be a cellmate or wind up as a memory
Yeah, and I could give a fuck if you kin to me
My life is up and down and side to side like a centipede

[Chorus]
Get ya hustle on, nigga get ya hustle on [4X]
We take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it
Take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it!
We take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it
Take the Pyrex and then we rock with it, roll with it!

[Juvenile]
The loamin hard sparkle like glass
Main bitch right behind me lookin sharp in the Jag
Security say you don't know me so I talk to 'em bad
If a nigga want somethin I got somethin for his ass
Choppers - I'm already knowin that it's a G thang
Ever since they tried to drown a nigga on the eastbank
Everybody need a check from FEMA
So he can go and sco' him some co-ca-llina
Get money! And I ain't gotta ball in the Beemer
Man I'm tryin to live, I lost it all in Katrina (damn)
And nobody cares what the police thank
Everybody fuckin with ki's cause it's a street thang

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
Wodie! You really feelin your folks
Just them crackers behind them desk-es that ain't hearin us though
We starvin! We livin like Haiti without no government
Niggaz killin niggaz and them bitches is lovin it
Fuck Fox News! I don't listen to y'all ass
Couldn't get a nigga off the roof with a star pass
Talkin - y'all comfortable right now to your own land
'Til a nigga catch ya down bad, starvin and want cash
Get your mind right, nigga get your money up
You're movin a little somethin, but you ain't done enough
Fo' shizzle - you know the boss gonna want a cut
Yeahhhhhh - or the boss gon' haveta fuck you up

I know I'm comin home to big fine after my day done

you always hear the bullshit stories and never say nothin
cause all of 'em in search for a man that's why they stay sufferin

holla at big daddy I'm comin home like I 'ppose ta
with a big ole bag of groceries and somethin that we can smoke up
we don't need a passion cause me and you is what's happenin

forget all of that yappin as long as we keep interactin
and we keep on attractin to each other with a passion

When the big dog is in ya they gon'wanna bother a G

I'm not tryna touch her so you can keep ya lil'rubber

Since I hit the TV now I'm a hot topic
But that don't mean Skipper won't pop it
Ain't that that dude with the H2 and the nice wallet?
And I got four words, stay off my dick
You wanna make it to where Skip ain't got shit
So you could ride around town and spread your gossip
Make up stories like ""U.T.P. done dropped Skip""
""Juve' used the man, paid him and then got rich""
C'mon stop it, you're makin' it up
Damn, how much hate is enough, boy you faker than fuck
""I just saw Skip blazin' it up
With a dime piece, smilin', gettin' head in the truck
Look, right now he headed for us"" (Look!)
""You lyin' motherfucker, dude he right behind 'em, you a busta""
Cause that's your old lady he with
Them hoes is for everbody, stop savin' a bitch

[Chorus: x2]

Open my eyes when the sun rise, blazin'
First nigga on the strip, even if my block's hotter than Cajun
I cop them Haitan, Jamaicans, Cubans and Yanks
Program with every race, now I cuts my own steak
Known to take G trips to a town like Wimbleton
Get a bust' down spot and be servin' like Wimbledon
Black John McEnroe, my rap flows are clapped (uh-hu)
Supposed to be hot as Tabasco, look at them assholes now
Homie, when I'm seen there's a crowd
With head bustas off the streets talkin' loud, ready to wild
Get respect for a few things
Deranged, the chopper spit
And the first off the block to cop a new Range
Life is fast, I get cash and write about it
At night it ain't safe in the South, we bout it bout it
Doubt it and get bodied 'cause the shotty will lift,
Your big muscleman bodyguard off his shit

[Chorus: x2]

Who lil' daddy with the fitted cap turned back?
Know some of these niggas got respect, he tryin' to earn that
Hopefully one of these niggas with yayo will see that
And put him in the right position he tryin' to be at
They talkin' in the wind but they no better than the play though
They could make a carton or a t-shirt in a day though
I ain't tryin' to flex my power bitch but I got say so
And I could make a million; American, yen or peso
They say I got a attitude, that's not the issue at all
Don't get involved when I'm doin' what I have to do
I'm suttle now but I could turn into an animal
Blow it out of proportion and I ain't understandin' you
Not in it for the short, I want the long term
Fuck the government, I'm a take care of my own children
You gon' have to zip your lip up, before a nigga flip up
I don't think they understandin' me, holler at 'em Skipper

I ain't tryin' to be stuck all in the corner and locked up
Tongue-kissin' a hoe a nigga know she a doctor
Hoe can make a nigga think she a queen
She standin' there, smellin' like potpourri, I bet she stank in them jeans

Need to shake it, wash it, rinse it, squeeze it and douche it
Call a time-out, freeze, at ease that pussy
They comin' out the woodworks, ain't no pride
They don't get tired, play they vibe and they'll shake it 'til they foot hurt

Say she dressin' for time, she got a lot of that
She ain't no nickel and dime, she got a dollar back
When she step her ass bounce two times
The wobble, wobble, make it hard for her to walk straight lines

Gotta add the soldiers on when you standin' behind her
You might get stuck in there and need a camera to find her
Gotta hold on to them handlebars 'cause you don't want that broad
Goin' tellin' your dawgs you got handled boy

Stand it up and make you get up on your tiptoes
Play with love man, kiss it, baby, watch him grow
Don't run your mouth about it, momma try to keep it low

Let's get a room somewhere deep on the outskirts
Give me head 'til yo' muh'fuckin' mouth hurts
Go tell your friends 'bout the suite up at the W
About the view and all the freaky shit I done to you

Now, when she see me, when you're not around
She be in my face, tryin' to see what I'm about
Here, take my number, maybe you can take me out
Take you somewhere and put some dick up in your mouth

I remember when you bitches wasn't so nice
Before the rings and the watches got a coat of ice
Same nigga, different day, we forever say
Money over bitches, U.T.P., Eight way

Pay attention to how it shake, she got a loose booty

Oh, I like the way you move it to the right, girl
No, I like the way you shake it to the left, girl
No, I like it when you bend it, when you step girl
Now, touch your toes while you hold your breath girl

And I ain't come here to ruin your night
I'm tryin' to put somethin' new in your life
Just by doin' you right, we can go somewhere for two if you like
Use the stars and the moon for the light 'cause you movin' it right

See, I'm really tryin' to do you tonight
If you dyke, bring your crew if you like
If any, um, booty is like, your booty is like
Call your whole crew booty delight, we make it 'Nolia Clap'

Whole hood payin' attention to me showin'
I just cooked up and the tube was fulled up
I sold my whole thang 'cause my dude and them pulled up

They talkin' about a nigga like a hurricane forecast
Boy kinda ignorant but he could move the fast
To hell with the talkin', we could go do it
The package right here, let's roll through it

I'm down South bred, that's what my mamma and my daddy say
Acts like New York and smoke the Cali way
Gutter, I hustled the corner, cuts and alleyways
Word mean nothin' to me, I'm goin' that-a-way

I got a dynasty and I ain't throwin' that away
I've been investin' my rhyme up on my strategy
And I don't feel that it's time to put the strap away

I ain't kissin' no ass to live with no nigga
I don't need this rap, bitch I'm in these streets
When Cash Money didn't pay me, I still got sleep

Get capped, you're on the phone, tell her I need the teeth
To set the nigga up to get his Jesus piece
She used to run it with Nate Dean, now she's a beast
Got her daughter sellin' for a 'G' at least

I move a lil' work, ain't nothin' to brag on
Somethin' to keep me nice and my homie to tag on
Twenty-four inch shoes on the rag on
I got poppin' in my hood and I'm that strong

Fiends keep smokin', please don't quit
You want another ?, Fiend on this
But watch it, the gun is under the shirt now
Me lead love and me will keep sendin' the work down

Before a nigga be done got killed
And I'm the one who done it
I'm in H-Town baby, the home of the hoe sale
Where niggaz don't just give you a brick
They give you the whole deal

Drug deals goin' down at ten dollar motels
Keep it on the down-low
'Cause somebody might go tell
Like it, get you what you need, just have yo' mail
And send your people 'round here
So I can get some more sale

Know that I got more yayo that most niggaz goin'
I'm gettin' it from the same bringin' all the in
I'm 'bout to get it dropped off, I'ma let you know when

And move like you 'sposed to be movin' because we strapped up
Don't get yourself clapped up for no reason

Bust your motherfuckin' head like a cantaloupe
Like Hannibal, woof, I'm an animal
Just cold dickin' the money down, huh, ain't it though?

I'ma do my damn thing 'til I can't no mo'
Don't make me pull this damn trigger 'til it ain't no mo'
And don't tell me where you ain't gon' go
I'ma just tell you one time, get to fuck 'til I ain't no mo'

All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin'

Juvenile,"We the only ones with work in the middle of the drought
Then them niggaz 'round the corner, come and see what we about
But we don't know they face so we don't want them by the house
But Skipper started bustin' when he saw them pullin' out

We did them niggaz dirty for fuckin' up our vibe
We packed up all our shit and moved it to the other side
He visited our spot, this girl was on my dick
She said, ""I love you, Juvenile but you know you the shit""

I grabbed on my glock, it's where the fools hang out
I'm only tryin' to hustle another change route
But they ain't gettin' nothin' if I ain't on beam
I'ma leave them niggaz sufferin' to find they own things

Workin' with plenty for talkin' 'bout hoes
I don't give them a penny, they comin' out they clothes
Grabbin' on my jimmy to see if nigga swole
Have to get it right with this big 'ol totem pole

Yes, I'm thuggin', yes, I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin' on you look, bitch, I'm buzzin'
Hoes and niggaz, I'm not lovin'
Fuck what you gettin' if I ain't got nothin'

What's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin'?
What's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin' with that?

We pull up in front the club and my rims was lookin' nice
The sub woofers bumpin', I need it in my life
We had a couple of fellas, was stuntin' with they eyes
We jump out of the Lexus and got they mind right

See, I ain't gotta rep 'cause they know I got chains
You can catch me in that dro, boy that money green thang
Get a fish and shrimp po', boy, and go sit on St. James
I'm a playa like my ole boy that's where I get game

Hoes start passin' 'cause they want me to see 'em
Ain't givin' no action if they want some per diem
And I keep a soldier rag from the am to the pm
My heater in my lap lookin' great up in the be-M

I know them niggaz watchin' 'cause they know that I'm buck
But they can catch a hot one for fuckin' with a thug
Nothin' was poppin' so we went in the club
All the hoes started jockin' 'cause they knew who we was

Yes, I'm thuggin', yes, I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin' on you look, bitch, I'm buzzin'
Hoes and niggaz, I'm not lovin'
Fuck what you gettin' if I ain't got nothin'

What's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin'?
What's happenin', what's happenin', what's happenin' with that?

The owner wasn't trippin', he let a nigga in and
The place was jumpin' and the hoes was grinnin'
Not at us though, it was at the other women
Some was butterscotch, some yellow like lemon

Had a couple of foul ones, chicken and pigeons
Some was kinda fine but them bitches didn't listen
Told them meet us outside and hoes got missin'
Put it in reverse and went back for more women

Everybody's rollin' and you can really see it
Look at how they scopin' for somebody to be with
I ain't on shit and I've been G'in since the 80's
Ain't about goin' somewhere, probably then ""Beat It""

You already knowin' the way that I'm rockin'
If you ain't goin' then ain't nothin' poppin'
Now I'm about to leave 'cause these niggaz eavesdroppin'
I got my heater on me now an I don't have to cock it

Yes, I'm thuggin', yes, I'm clubbin'
I ain't trippin' on you look, bitch, I'm buzzin'
Hoes and niggaz, I'm not lovin'

Juvenile,"Girl, you're lookin' like a '4 dropped low to the ground
Ooh, I like it when you shake it up and swing it around
Don't stop, ooh, you servin' it now
Have a nigga lookin' for you, searchin' around

I tried to pass you up but you're lookin' so hot
Got my dick gettin' stiffer than a robot
You not lookin' concerned about what a hoe got
You just layin' it down right there in yo' spot

When you pass a nigga, come to a slow stop
Wonderin' how I'm lookin' when the clothes drop
Fresh out of the fingernail and toe shop
Lookin' real, I gotta get her when the hoe pop

She got a shape, ain't nothin' fake, she in the race
Her pretty face, I'd give her a 7 or 8 or maybe 9 if she really fine
Side and behind with a lady mind
Diamonds, she genuine

Let your hair down, girl, you already know
When I grab ya ass, I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voodoo

You my lil' mamma mia and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, hoe?
You my lil' mamma mia and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy hoe?

Your big, fine, don't be scared, put your hands up
Give me a minute, you ain't gotta give your man up
In a relationship, I understand and what?
He ain't focusin' right now, so we can fuck

Move, shake, bounce, pop
Pancake it, pull it over at the bus stop
Swing it back around, stop it there and make it wiggle
Put it in reverse and back it up just a little

It ain't your birthday, nope, it ain't your birthday
But I'ma treat you like that, if you can serve me
Girl, you a stallion, let me take you to the derby
I bet a hundred that you gon' be up in first place

Pose, move, stop, walk
Shit, I think you more finer than the block talk
Ladies, put your hands up if you need to get dropped off
Up even higher if you wanna leave in my car

Let your hair down girl, you already know
When I grab ya ass I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

You my lil' mamma mia and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, hoe?
You my lil' mamma mia and you already know
Who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, who's ya daddy, hoe?

Like it when you be dressin' all fancy
And your lips be lookin' like candy
Come here and get you a sip of this brandy
Let me think a size off of what I can see

You musta been eatin' by grannies
'Cause that ass lookin' phat in them panties
Tryin' to treat you like one of my family
And I won't be actin' like your man be

I'm the shit lil' mama, just chance me
'Cause you're lookin' at a more advanced me
Now drop it and pop it and shake it like a dog
Look back at a gangsta when you're catchin' the wall

Let your hair down, girl, you already know
When I grab ya ass, I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

By the car lot-where we spark a lot
Up in the hallway it be dark a lot
We don't talk to cops cause we all be hot

Homey you need to get you somethin' new (why not)
Shit I'm ridin' somethin' green, somethin' blue (why not)
They gon' respect it when a gangsta come through (why not)
They doin' numbers, we'll do somethin' too (why not)

Is you doin ya dirt, they really know ya bout ya work
If they scopin ya turf you goin' out there head first
Do you know the rules when you got beef with a fool
Can you stick and move and do you sleep with the tool
You in the camp you bout to make you an examp
So when they see the stamp they goin 'respect it like a champ
You light in the ass but kind of heavy with the cash
Be rollin' the grass you still totin' the solider rag
You been out there on the grind spendin' most of ya time
In a section full of nobody's so you gotta shine
Will you bust a head, know how to do it-how to play it
Bet a hundred in the field and parlay
Can you flip a Z, go back and get a Quater ki
When you rid of that call Rico up and order three
Put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
If you wanna be respected as the G'est

You like states with pretty hoes in ya face
You hate checks, you just come home on a case
Can you make a name-will you be patient in the game
Can you state ya claim, and reputation stay the same
Will you hold it down when ya lil'homies ain't around
Will you hold ya ground like you the only one in town
Is you feelin' this, you listen to it when you creep
You real in the streets all in the hood with the heat
You ain't tryna joke gotta be real for ya folks
Is ya people broke they aggravate you on the porch
Do you sell weed and you don't never make a profit
Do you blow big until it hurt you in ya pocket
You just scared to lose cause you a winner all the time
You gotta lot to prove lil'sinner on the grind
Put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
If you wanna be respected as the G'est

Do you G's up when it's a dime in ya grill
Do you freeze up when it's that time for a kill
If they pop at you is you goin' pop back at 'em
You goin' stay away from niggas if they rattin'
Wanna ride swoll pull up on 24 flats
Can you get a hoe without you throwin' her a stack
Is you callin' shots can you stay away from the cops
You know how to stop you be inside when it's hot
You from the East, you from the West, you from the South
You from the North, or the Midwest what you about
Can you twist a gar without you fuckin' up the road
Did you get a car just to be stuntin' for the hoes
You been out here and it's ya time for a lick
Do you know this year as you aknowledgin' the shit

Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Miracles will happen as we trip

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little crazy

Crazy yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no

If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless

No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit

In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly
Ain't that crazy
Oh babe, oh darlin'

The moment I been waiting on

K'Jon,"Feels like the walls are close,
Everything is broken.
My son, my world, coming down on me 
It's like a dream I can't wake up from
I keep on running, and wait 'till the morning comes!
Maybe tomorrow is different 
Maybe when I wake up and I see you
It will make a difference!
Maybe you'll save me from drowning, 
but you can't see the tears from all the rain.

[Chorus]
I've been going through some things
Been dealing with some changes
But girl I got one question, will you be there?
When a man is sick and tired 
And this world is set on fire
After all that's said and done
Will you be there?
Will you be there?

Sometimes I can't stop from thinking
Used to think that drinking was the answer to me
Sinking in my sorrows, an if its a tomorrow will i be around
Or consume this swallowed maybe i go back to the bottom

[Chorus]

All alone, I'm so alone, baby
Baby I need you here!
? who knows
I said that you'll be here
I need some paper
You're my necessity
? will you be there for me?

[Chorus]",Will You Be There?
K'La,"Its hard lovin' someone else 
When you barely got enough to love yourself 
And its hard tryna ease someones pain 
When your own hurt is more than you can take 

But how the hell can we be lovers 
If we don't even love each other 
If we're down for one another 
We qotta find a way to cover each others back 
Instead of tracks 
I wanna make you smile instead of make you mad 
And I wont act like I'm all that 
'Cause if you left id take you back 
'Cause I don't care what you done done 
I just know I want your love 

[Chorus]
So can we just smoke 
Instead of arguing all the time 
I know you got a lot on your mind 
And I know you think its unladylike but 
Boy its been a hell of a night soooo 
Turn the light down low 
Its time to let it all go 
You can send ya worries up to God above 
So you can send me all ya love 

Its hard tryna shut my mouth 
Especially when all this stuff keeps comin' out 
(I don't really mean it baby) 
And its hard lettin' problems go 
Especially when I already told you so 

I gotta look ova your shoulder 
To make sure you do what I told ya 
You swear to God that you don't know her 
We just keep gettin' all over 
Each others backs instead of tracks 
I wanna make you smile instead of make you mad 
And I wont act like I'm all that 
'Cause if you left id take you back 
'Cause I don't care what you done done 
I just know I want your love 

[Chorus]

Hard on the surface 
Soft on the inside 
'Cause inside I cry every time you say bye 
I man up and take it 
But it takes time 
'Cause whenever you're here 
I feel like I'm still on the safe side 
Danger Danger he just left me hanging 
Wish I could walk out of love 
I don't know which door I came in 
Its such a shame and 
He got blaming everybody 
But him for this stuff he been sayin' 
Who am I playin' 
That's a changed man 
And I just wanna check his days out like the days inn 
He qot me praisin' God just for his presence 
And I could never give him back 
I would just regret it and I could not forget it 
All the things that we been through 
High school , new dudes and a couple baby blues 
I never got to choose 
But I never really had to 
Before they ever checked you out I already bagged you

So you can send me all your love

So you can send me all your love",All Your Love [Edited Version]

Uh, Aha

I miss to give, I miss to love
But you broke up promises
Just like you broke my trust
Never again, I won't hurt again
I promised myself never to love another man, another man

You promised you love me, love me, love me
You promised you'll stay, you'll stay
But I don't feel the same

You're the one to blame
Why I act this way
You're the one to blame
Why I think this way
You're the one to blame
Blame, blame, blame
You're the one to blame

Who would've tought, I'd end up this way
Stepping on hearts and throwing love away
But you can't hate the player you gotta hate the game
And I know it hurts to see the monster that you made
That you made

You promised you love me, love me, love me
You promised you'll stay, you'll stay
But I don't feel the same

Her only mistake is I caught her where I can take over
She cooks stake I'm not a carnivore it'd be kind of raw
But the wine is fine, I'm mature and be times that's all woman
Have better talks my teenage daughter
Then we have and you a grown woman
So I be vague when I answer questions
About my life or hustlin', I know you used to first dates
But dudes be all the fun and had this, they want that
Did time and fucked that, beat this they know people
Connections and all that, 
You tied up but let's try intellectual higher subject
Like metaphysics or the science of it
That is corny also, let's talk about you being my lawful
But nah, not just yet, maybe later we just met
But for now, I need to keep you around
'Cause this the most perfect all I found in a while

You're the one to blame
Why I act this way
You're the one to blame
Why I think this way

[Chorus]
I was stabbed by Satan, on the day that I was born
I was promised lovin', but instead I was torn
La la la, la la la, My heart bled tears
La la la, la la la, My eyes shed tears

A poor black ghetto child
He can't shoot and he can't go run a mile
There's no school and the kids go running wild
The police and the courts wanna run 'em out
He's so ? and the police hate 'em all
He ain't seen his daddy since back in '84
But oh well so it be now he's in jail
His mother's stressing just to get him out on bail
Let's sing it out

[Chorus]

And the story goes on
There's no glory and the worry takes a toll on
His own body but his buddies wanna roll on
It's all bloody when the car comes to a stop
The police with the big glocks pull 'em out
They say freeze but there's only one one coming out
There's two dead with a legal gun to his head
It's stupid, he should of played ball instead

[Chorus]

So one day when it's all said and done
My life will be the bluest rap song ever sung
My verses will be curses to the rich
And all sorts of authority will cease to exist
My daughters will be free of war ?
Raisin they aim in the silence of revolution my face will appear
Like the vision of a prisoner with his last bed
This song is a poem and the whole poem is a tear
Drop to no ear

[Chorus]",I Was Stabbed by Satan
K'NAAN,"So!

In the beginning
There was a hum
From a poet whose pulse fell
Drum drum drum!

He would perform prayers and all
Till one day he heard a voice call
Come come come!

Suspicious he moved
With vicious caution
Dismisses,
He thinks is a little often
People get held back
By the void inside 'em.

Yo!

The void said,
I'm poised to speak inside you
""Rejoice then please let me invite you
To evil, greed and lies too.""

Yeah!

Confused and dazed
He moved in ways
He soon became ""Hakuna""

A knock on his door, his heart is no more
A knock on his door, his soul is no more

Yeah
That was in the beginning
As the story goes on

So

The poets got a proposal
He would always hope but never know
What it feels
To be free.
He would be the frozen
Imposed as the chosen,
All laws oppose him
But it would be greed.

That's got him there
He's power-hungry,
And proud too.

People don't care, people just care
Evil don't care, evil just care

Yeah!
That was In the beginning
There was a hum.
Then things changed.

They say
It is better to light a candle than to curse the dark in the eyes of the youth
There are question marks
Like freedom.
Freedom for the mind and soul,
We don't see them.
See them for their worth at all,
That's why we lead'em
Lead'em to these wars
And what is it we feed 'em.
Feed em our impurities
And who it is we treat 'em
Treat em like the enemy
Humanity will need'em.
Need 'em like the blood we spill
And we're freedom
Freedom for the hearts we fill
We mislead 'em.
They hunger for the love we give
But we cheat 'em.
The guys beat him and all he wants
Is his freedom,
So they defeat him,
Whatever spirit hes got.
Beat him!
And they teach him
The rest of the world don't need him
And he believes.
In the disease that hes heathen
Put up your fists if all you want is freedom
Put up your fists if all you want is

That was in the beginning
Then things changed

Yeah!

And we keep holdin' on,
And we keep bein' strong
And we keep goin' on
And on and on and on",In the Beginning
K'NAAN,"So yeah, basically
A lot of people ask me how life was then
So here it is

My old home smelled of good birth
Boiled red beans, kernel oil and hand me down poetry
It's brick white-washed walls widowed by first paint
The tin roof top humming songs of promise while time is
Locked into demonic rhythm with the leaves
The trees had to win
Hugging them, loving them a torturous love
Buggin' when
It was over and done
The round cemented pot kept the rain drops cool
Neighbors and dwellers spatter in the pool
Kids playing football with his hand and sock
We had what we got, and it wasn't a lot
No one knew they were poor
We were all innocent to greeze judgment
The country was combusting with life like a long hibernating volcano
With a long tale of success like J-Lo
Farmers, fishers, fighters, even fools had a place in production
The coastal line was the place of seduction
The coral reef make you daze in reflection
The women walked with grace and perfection
And we just knew we were warriors too
Nothing morbid, its true
We were glorious
Boom!

Then one day it came
Spoiled up a ray like rain
Like oil in a flame, it pained
The heart attack sudden
Odder than eleven
Harder than a punch in the womb
Harder than the lunch you consume
For us, it had a cancerous fume, more lust
Men who made killing hoggies,
Selling prout fully like healthy livestock
It made tides rock with a diligent mock
Confused are the people, infused in the evil
Professed to eject like Jews in the sequel, to win
It came in the morning, with a warning and without
The hurting was a burden, only certain was doubt
A mythical tale, no soul knows well
Liberty went to hell, freedom called for shells
Fierce was the blow, keep your ears to the show
It appears Orwell was right in '84
Had big brother kill Mother in her store
With all of us watching, we didn't lover her anymore
Peep my poem, Mother was my old home
Good winners looted, in my old home
Religion is burned down, in my old home
Kindness is shackled, in my old home
Justice has been raped, in my old home
Murderers hold post, in my old home
The land, bombers, ghosts, in my old home
We got pistols with eyes, corruption and lies
Trusting snakes, and death without breaks
Suspicious new borns live in our horn
Used to the pain, rack bodies not grain
Chopped limbs not trees
Spend lives not wealth
Seek vengeance not truth, the craziest youth
Hoist pain not plans, nigga' fuck your parents

Bandits will beat us down, in my old home
Rumors are law now, in my old home
Sedatives of faith, in my old home
Rapists are praised, in my old home
Demonds dressed well, in my old home
Infants are nailed, in my old home
Spirits are jailed, in my old home
Grudges grow tails, in my old home

High roads of sea in electric Hayden
Outward labor beneath stubborn faith
Our farms produce guilty grub and
Our kids depend on shifty luck, see
Our muse is life for death is old, so
Don't blame me for truth I told, say
Good winners looted, in my old home
Religion is burned down, in my old home
Kindness is shackled, in my old home
Justice has been raped, in my old home
Murderers hold post, in my old home
The land, bombers, ghosts, in my old home",My Old Home

Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us cause they're bitchin'
Life isn't fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood sinkin
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run, forfeit, and everything I know listen!

I was the least expected
Hop on and get rejected
Walk on and feel neglected
I feel like I'm the message
Unheard but I'm the message

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your struggling
Smile when your in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now
Smile and no one knows you

Smile when he leaves you
Smile cause girl he needs you

Smile despite the pain yo

To my man Kareem in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened

I had to grow my intuition
Had me deep in pain
Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected
They call me
The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos

I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

[Chorus]

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please
But never let em see you down smile while you bleedin'

I should be chilling on beaches instead my bone freezes ducking glocks 
And I was and 12s like Jesus the realest thing to me is since I was a fetus 
The only break I ever got was at recess so legitimately 
I remain very little relieved and that thug rappas 
I remain very little entriged and can you blame me with how we lived in the late 80's 
Throwing rocks at the crazy ladies 
And when we played these crazy games the whole crew had crazy names 
We even had a crypper we called him lazy legs 
But my faith remains untouched and unchanged 
Still in my block you hear more shots then a gun range

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

More to the truth no writing just me recording in the booth 
Forced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the group 
I speak truth deep roots remain equal danger 
The pain in my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger
Hey man I'm from the oddest hardest progress then departed 
I'm now known as a recording artist spitting what little remains of your memories 
In your process bigger or little making your name into a colossus 
Believe me I'm thankful my brothers still with me 
And ain't much changed Bobby's still troubling with me 
I'm still mom and pory but we always dently I got a little recording gig but evidently

The tales of hunting will be weak
My poetry hales with in the streets
My poetry fails to be discrete
It travels across the earth and seas
From Eritrea to the West Indies
It knows no boundaries
No cheese
It studied in parts of Greece
I am sick as far as lyrics
And with this far as gimmicks
I spit par age and limit
The shit they talk in rapid
I am hip the hop as living
I skip the obvious woman
Don't get what I am presenting
No rims my mind spinning

I was born and raised in a place
Where torn of flame would place
Where the foreigners not embrace
Where they warn you jog and pace
Where loners low what they gaze
Where the corners slow at a chase
Where they tarts and turn in the maze
With the pistol upon your face
So come with me to my longs
The death and deal we run
With passion see how I come
No cash I am free in the slums
The past can we overcome
I am asking we be the ones
To actually be the ones
To free our people from gun

Poison in my veins, inside I'm torturing my brains,
And still I try, 
Voices in my head, am I alive or am I dead,
Alone I cry, 

I'm still awake,a nd its quarter to six, I'm trying to write and I ain't thought of no,
I live with guilt like I slaughtered the sick, I live with shame, like my daughter a bitch,
I don't make living but I still persist, I could sell out but I still resist, 
So don't tell me about no pain and shit,
I was born and raised in poverty bitch, And I smile all the while and don't complain, 
I'm something like Gail Scott heroine, do you know what it feels like to lose a friend, 
Again and again and again, again
The bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of blood within the mess flowing, 
I'm the bitterness in the killer the poet, the river, the blood will keep on flowing, 
People inside me say, the wanna see me go on tragically, and its evil, its evil, 
Cause I'm only twenty something years old working for a crumb or some bread or nothing

[Chorus]

The harder the struggle the deeper the trouble,
Come out of the bubble, ill teach you to cuddle,
With demons inside me, what demon is not me,
These demons inside me they got me, they stop me from feeding,
And eating and keeping it even, and even my reason for breathing this season,
? in a danger, my nose when I'm reading, its bleeding on paper, its bleeding on paper,
And I'm tired of this violence, so tortured inside, ? open inside, have I already died,
Has mom already cried? And why do I feel like I'm over this life, I'm not hateful, I'm grateful, 
My girlfriend is tasteful, living it up, I might even blow, like a leak in a truck, 
Wit a torch and a clutch, and explosion that leaves the hole ? the dust, and the people, 
Inside me saying, they wanna see me go tragically, and its evil, 
Cause I'm only twenty something, working for some crumbs and some bread

Releasin' your tension, the stress and disorder
It's big in America, Stephanie, Erica,
Both of them suffer from livin' in hairy 'cause
Livin' is very competitive, hasslin' creditors, hazardous accidents,
Driving with negligence, too many beverages,
People got too many things on they lettuces.
TV's deadliest, professin' the ugliest: war, war, war, WAR!
What the hell you keep on killin' me for?
Please, won't you come and bend down low?
Let me tell you what little I know,
And if it's worth somethin', spread it indeed
Like shit and vomit that's under your feet.
I was born in a pot, boilin' black and hot,
Waitin' to be tasted and rappin' a lot.
But justice would not come and eat my flesh,
Instead, I had poverty to feed my stress,
Until my life became an ode to the gun,
Not needed, like a overcoat to the sun.
So, I thought I was just made to exist,
(Tss, yeah) not to live or change and resist.
But fear will have you believin' fear,
Paralyzed have you bleedin' tears.
This is the therapy needed, so use it.

People need water like Kanye needs Jesus.

K'NAAN,"I put a pen to the paper,
This time as visual as possible,
Guns blast at the hospital,
The walls are white washed with tin rooftops,
To show love you lick two shots,
It's dangerous man,
Journalists hire gunmen there's violent women,
Kids trust no one cause fire burnt them,
Refugees die in boats, headed for peace,
Is anyone scared of death here' Not in the least,
I walk by the old lady selling coconuts under the tree,
Life is cheap here but wisdom is free,
The beach boys hang on the side, leaning with pride,
Scam artists and gangsters fiendin to fight,
I walk with three kids that can't wait to meet God
Lately, that's Bucktooth, Mohamed and Crybaby,
What they do everyday just to eat lord have mercy,
Strapped with an AK and they blood thirsty

[Chorus]
So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? 
So what's hardcore? Really, are you hardcore? 

We begin our day by the way of the gun,
Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front,
We got no police ambulance or fire fighters,
We start riots by burning car tires,
They looting, and everybody start shooting,
Bullshit politicians talking bout solutions, but it's all talk,
You can't go half a block with a road block,
You don't pay at the road block you get your throat shot,
And each road block is set up by these gangsters,
And different gangsters go by different standards,
For example, the evening is a no go,
Unless you wanna wear a bullet like a logo,
In the day you should never take the alleyway,
The only thing that validates you is the AK,
They chew on Jad it's sorta like coco leafs,
And there ain't no police

[Chorus]

I'm a spit these verses cause I feel annoyed,
And I'm not gonna quit till I fill the void,
If I rhyme about home and got descriptive,
I'd make Fifty Cent look like Limp Biskit,
It's true, and don't make me rhyme about you,
I'm from where the kids is addicted to glue,
Get ready, he got a good grip on the machete,
Make rappers say they do it for love like R-Kelly,
It's HARD, harder than Harlem and Compton intertwined,
Harder than harboring Bin Laden and rewind,
""to that earlier part when I was kinda like""

Worry I never let you,
Soon as I leave the venue,

I still haven't gone astray,
Don't drink or smoke and sway,

It feels so good to say,
Go out and receive it,

Your boy has grown up decent,
Grandma can you believe it?

Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend, and they call me Mr. Rock
No B word or N word, I don't need those words (no)
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful

You real, but my real is tenfold
My real'll make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils

So bold nothin's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls

These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light bulb
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so

They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets",ABCs

I got my own sound I don't sound like the rest
And even my attire and my choice of dress
And not long ago I don't spoke English
My point is police pull me over a lot
They wonder what kind of rap sheet I got
And sometimes I take a young girl out to eat
And hold the door open oh, you're so sweet
Of course my affection's super illustrated
And I like to give don't reciprocate it
Unless you could give me someone innovated
Well lets cook it up we dont refrigerate it

Sweet land for robberies

Grab me an army green

Thrills and spills
Eat and sleep
Hump and kill
Shop til you drop
Work til you dead
Get all you can
Then get in the wear
Outta my face
On your knees
Sleep in the mansion
Shut out the streets
Make that cake
Woop that trick
Lick my swagger
Suck my sick
Get high get low get sticky get rich
Get yo own show get down get quick
You slow you blow you broke your fix

Terror dome, home swag home
Home swag home

There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich 'cause I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass 'cause it's natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
I'm trying to walk the lane, the siratul mustaqim was the cane
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

K'NAAN,"She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang, she shot me. [Repeat: x3]
She shot me, she shot me,
Bang, bang. (Get out the way, yo)

There she goes again,
The girl is Ethiopian.
In other words, she came through explodin'
In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum,
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early,
But continuing the story,
Don't worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry
""You're very handsome"" is what she said.
And the way she looked in my eyes said ""Put me to bed.""

Oh my, oh my, I should have known when she said to me on the phone:
""You do not know me very well, but I would never hurt a fly.""
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.
I said she aimed at my chest with love in her eye.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Scorpion,
She's so hot she's a scorch-ian,
Killing me softly,
Lauryn or Kevorkian,
Couldn't tell if she's coo-coo or corky, when
I asked her her name she said ""Call me Ten.""
Testing, testing
Things just got more interesting
She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster,
A very Western toaster,
She ain't nothing Kosher.
Ah, she lets me closer.
Hotter than a pepper-crusted Samosa
While I try to keep my composure.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang.

Am I wrong?
But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain if not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong.
Cause I was strong and still,
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang, she got me.
She got me, she got me,
Bang, bang.

She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one.
It went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart. (Straight through my heart)
Although I could have walked away,
I stood my ground and let her spray.
She shot me, she shot me
Bang, bang she shot me [Repeat:x3]

K'NAAN,"Yeah
Believe it or not
What kept me alive
Is my dreams

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
I'm a dreamer
But I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world
From here to your hood
We alive man
It's OK to feel good

I got a friend named Flow,
Who got a friend named blow
With a finger named clap
That'll leave you on the side like a Kangol hat.
He ain't have no choice he was born this way
These streets will pull your number like a phone display
You gotta be defensive with your life
You gotta be like Bush and take Pre-emptive strikes
And the boys from the hood are always hard
Let alone in Mogadishu it's a mastered art
If you bring the words hood to a seminar
We from the only place worse then Kandahar,
Now that's kinda hard
But we still like to party and hardy har
Something good happens we say Mashalla
Something bad happens Kay Sara Sara.
I close my eyes and all I can see is you dancing with me

[Chorus]

It's ok to feel good, it's the truth
Yo check it out

What would it take for a boy about my age to hear cheers in his head upon that stage
And the cheers that would drowned out the tears from my brown eyes
Come on back stage you see the screams ain't the screams from gun shot streams
In my dreams these screams are from hot teens
And I'm barely thirteen but I pack dirty, a Russian fire arm that shoots thirty
Just then I hear the bus engine I'm transcending I'm crowd surfing I can't see the time burning I'm not hurting with my mahogany pen.
I'm on a world tour with Mohammad and them.
And we be over sees and not in these trees where my peeps stay alive like the Bee gees
And the likes of JZ would save my steeze and singing handily brought Hip-Hop peace

[Chorus]

Sometimes we just like to have fun,
Man we like to forget all the fighting
All the guns and the tires burning,

Back on the verse
Imagine crack was in birth
Imagine the earth wasn't hurt
Imagine no homeland alerts
Imagine no record locater so I wouldn't have to get a criminal waiver
Imagine if peace wasn't in my briefs
Instead peace could stretch across the sees
So finally we could just rest and in easy no refugees
And you, well you could dress in a book
And I can read your body in less then a look
I got a dream girl in my mind and that the hook,
An intellectually, sexual and still can cook

Yeah, and I feel good right now
I feel good right here
You feel good?

[Chorus]

We not down and out, just cause times are hard
Yeah shout out to the struggeler's,
In my country, hardest place on earth
But still
I still know how to get down,
I still know how to vibe out,
I still know how to talk to a pretty girl.
Take it easy now.",Dreamer
K'NAAN,"Picture the morning taste and devour
We rise early pace up the hour
Streets is bustling hustling their heart out
You can't have the sweet with no sour

Spices herbs the sweet scent of flower
We came out precisely the hour
Clouds disappear the sun shows the power
No chance of a probable shower

I fell in love with my neighbors daughter
I wanted to protect and support her
Never mind I'm just 12 and a quarter
I had dreams beyond our border.

Is it true when they say all you need is just love,
Is it true
What about those who have loved
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free
To be free
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me.

Fatima,
What did the Young Man say
Before he stole you away
On that fateful day Fatima
Fatima,
Did he know your name
Or the plans we made,
To go to New York City, Fatima

And after school we studied the lessons
I ask God to slow down the seconds
He does the opposite that's what I'm guessing
I better chill and count my own blessings

Fatima, Fatima what is the matter
How come you ain't come up the ladder
So we can be like there's no tomorrow
Damn you gonna make me wait until tomorrow

She spoke Arabic and Swahili
She'd say Upendo (Swahili for love) 
Anta Habibi (Arabic for, you are my love, dearest friend)
You so bright, you shine like my TV
Then one day she never came to meet me

Is it true when they say all you need is just love,
Is it true
What about those who have loved
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free
To be free
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me.

Fatima,
What did the Young Man say
Before he stole you away
On that fateful day Fatima
Fatima,
Did he know your name
Or the plans we made,
To go to New York City, Fatima [Repeats]

If beauty was in the eyes of beholder
How come everyone hushed when she walked by
How come girls would look just to scold her
How come the angel wanted to hold her?

Fatima, Fatima I'm in America
I make rhymes and I make them delicate
You would have liked the parks in Connecticut
You would have said I'm working too hard again.

Damn you shooter, Damn you the building
Whose walls hid the blood she was spilling
Damn you Country so good at killing
Damn you feeling, for persevering

Is it true when they say all you need is just love,
Is it true
What about those who have loved
Only to find that it's taken away
And why do they say that the children have rights to be free
To be free
What about those who I've known
Whose memory still lives inside of me.

Now I just want to make it clear, I don't want you to shed a tear.

I was initiated into manhood at thirteen and it wasn't a barmitzvah
I break a bottle on you like a bad bartender
Let my star venture out, I got war in me, so let me vent it out

I don't expect you to feel my pain
But with respects to the rules of the game
They don't apply because I made it this far
Stage dive like a ghetto rock star

And if rap gets jealous cause I rock heavy

Ill admit it I could spit it like a fitted knitted cap
That means tight and won't stop like a city cab
That means I'm not white
But I figured do it big because the slum needs me
So instead of getting a beat from Kanyeezy
Who would probably take half my budget
I could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu
Where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova
The hood is harder than you thought

And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me

Is it fair to say that I am stressing out
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out
My homeys said I was stupid for even joining
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing
How she had good for good state colleges
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem
But they don't understand the power of significance
More than brilliance and certainly more than difference
And if you ask me now would I repeat it
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in
Well the answer is if not me where the cancer is
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazareth
And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous
And bush isn't really being all that inaccurate
When he says we're winning the war cos its staggering
But that's cause we're killing everybody that we see
And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent
Cos my women back home, we're constantly arguing
And I must be crazy cos all I'm obsessing with is
Her Myspace and Facebook and who's commenting
I swear to god if she's cheatin' I'm doing her ass in
I can tell with one look and it came to me
Sounding like something from a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me

Meet Sarah, the proud mother of young Sebastian
Suburban professional went to college in shton
In self pity she suddenly cried
Would my life be important if I suddenly died?
Neighbors saying what a nice women she was
Keeping mostly to herself ever since the divorce
And with the company downsizing and the fall and all
She really shouldn't take it that personal at all
It wasn't her boss who had his eyes on her thighs
And got a rise from her rising off the desk though
And despite remembering saying no plenty of times
It was still a damn surprise being let go
And now stuck with a mortgage she cant afford
And too educated to blame the corporate world
She got on welfare and hated it case work a power tripping
And generally being degraded if
Nothing else she was treated sick
And ineffective which is the worst thing
That she'd been left with
Damn, no magic from David Blane
No painter to pain this pain
No Morgan Freeman to narrate the shame
So she took refuge and prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
And it came to her sounding something like a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me
People like me

I guess I told you about myself to a degree
Just by telling you about people like me
But people like me they speak politely
They don't start no beef or peace
Everybody gotta eat but everybody doesn't
Which is why I want to tell you about my favorite cousin
He and I grew up where the sun shines
And we both partook with the gun crimes
And we both liked American rap rhymes
Even though we didn't understand one line
If you remember my line of notes in my last album
I talked about a close call with a grenade
I think we both must have been about 7th grade
But don't panic we both survived without damage
But we developed a bond like we survived the titanic
But when the country became frantic
My mother tried to get us out, planned it
To the last detail except the plan got derailed
Cos there wasn't enough money for the plain tickets
How bitter when my mother had to chose who to take with her
So my cousin got left in the war and that's just hard to recall
But now I take refuge and prayer
Kinda like finding god in the phone book
It came to me sounding kinda like something from a song hook

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurting people like me

That'll leave you not breathin'.

I'm born and bred

And what not.

I'm right there.

Yeah,
We used to take barb wire
Mold them around discarded bike tires.
Roll em down the hill in foot blazin'.
Now that was our version of mountain bike racing
Damn!
Do you see why it's amazing,
When someone comes out of such a dire situation
And learns the English language,
Just to share his observation!
Probably get a Grammy without a grammar education.
So fuck you school and fuck you immigration!
And all of you who thought I wouldn't amount to constipation.
And now I'm here without the slightest fear and preservation,
They love me in the slums and in the native reservations.
The world is a ghetto with ministerin' deprivation.
My mommy didn't raise no fool did she hooyo?
I promise I would get it and remain strictly loyal.
Cause when they get it then they let it all switch and spoil.
But I just illuminated it like kitchen foil.
A lot of main stream niggas is yappin' about yappin'
A lot of underground niggas is rappin' about rappin'.
I just wanna tell you what's really crackalackan
Before the tears came down this is what happened.

I learned from the deadly streets no regrets 
And I wasn't ever looking for street cred 
But these streets bred me to be street safe 

It's no secret we know how to squeeze lead 
But the Pre-set is not to have to squeeze it 
Used to be at peace but now we using T-Shirts 
And it reads RIP cause the peace dead 

When I walk through the slums like (Nomane?) 
Little children say K'naan (Bumaye ?) 
The rap game just got itself a new day 
This is Africa, Hooray.

I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride

How did Mandela get the will to surpass the everyday
When injustice had him caged and trapped in every way
How did Gandhi ever withstand the hunger strikes and all
Didn't do it to gain power or money if I recall
It's to give; I guess I'll pass it on
Mother thinks it'll lift the stress of Babylon
Mother knows, my mother she suffered blows
I don't know how we survived such violent episodes
I was so worried, and hurt to see you bleed
But as soon as you came out the hospital you gave me sweets
Yeah, they try to take you from me
But you still only gave 'em some prayers and sympathy
Dear mama, you helped me write this, by showing me to give is priceless

And any man who knows a thing knows, he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurt and I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall

All I can say is the worst is over now
We can serve the hard times, divorce is over now
They try to keep us out, but they doors is open now
My nigga Akon is getting awards for covers now
This is K'naan, and still reppin' the S
Comin' out of Mogadishu and still draped in the mess
And no matter how we strong, homie
It ain't easy coming out of where we from, homie
And that's the reason why, I could never play for me
Tell 'em the truth, is what my dead homies told me
Oh yeah, I take inspiration from the most heinous of situations
Creating medication out my own tribulations
Dear Africa, you helped me write this, by showing me to give is priceless

And any man who knows a thing knows, he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurt and I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall

I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breeze

Nothing is perfect man, that's what the world is
All I know is
I'm enjoying today
You know, 'cause it isn't everybody that you get to give

And any man who knows a thing knows, he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurt and I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall

They'll call me freedom
Just like a waving flag

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,
And then it goes back

To the throne, stronger than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone,
But it's my home, all I have known,
Where I got grown, streets we would roam.
But out of the darkness, I came the farthest,
Among the hardest survival.
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak,
Accept no defeat
Surrender retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat and
We wondering when we'll be free,
So we patiently wait, for that fateful day,
It's not far away, so for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,
And then it goes back

So many wars, settling scores,
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor,
I heard them say, love is the way,
Love is the answer, that's what they say,
But look how they treat us, make us believers,
We fight their battles, then they deceive us,
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us,
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers.

But we struggling, fighting to eat,
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait, for that faithful day,
It's not far away, but for now we say,

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,
And then it goes back

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,
And then it goes back

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,
And then it goes back

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
And then it goes back, and then it goes back,

K'NAAN,"Bundle up my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button it's so old

I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble

I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shifty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal

But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do

They don't teach us the ABC's
We play on the hard concrete

Rock, you know my era
Be-boy seasoning, salt-n-pepa
Grown and sexy, come with the extra
Crushed up linen, fly like Cessna

This type brew, I gave it birth
Now it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia

And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend and they call me Mr. Rock

No be word or N word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful

You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils

So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls

These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light bulb
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so

They don't teach us the ABC's

Your stubborn nose pretending to belong to the machine

I’ve been waiting for you to come to your senses
Holding up your heavy heart, down there in the trenches
You don’t have to carry that weight all by yourself
Even you the mercenary could use a little help
You’ve got your gun, your bulletproof pride
You never run, but you sure know how to hide

My friend said he had seen you
At a movie theater
You looked just had you had always
Didn’t ask about me either
I won’t say life ends without you

'Cause I wear an air piece just to hear what he say 
When my son visit, I don't know why I get livid
Maybe I'm jealous of his age

Young like him, 
Had a mouth on me a tongue like him

Tush! and I ain't never been a wuss
Have more arms than an octopus

I never thought I'd see the hair in my nose gray
But life goes on how ironic
If I could do it over I'd probably smoke chronic
But still follow the footsteps of prophet Mohammed
I probably turn every lie that I told honest

And flush my sedatest

I've waited about pop pop pop pop
That's four cousins shot
I got grudges, let's discust this
My music needs no touch ups
I got a long record of fuck ups, trust me
You don't know who has this weight of mine,
Or a life as hard as mine
I had to hustle, chop, sell drugs, grind
Whatever you wanna call it is fine,
But just listen
And don't prejudge
I don't want anyone dissmissin' me as another thug or some shit like that
No sir, if I fall I will get right back
I got circumstances, but let me stop dancin' around the issue
And tell you straight forward, I'm poor
A refugee been in prison and survived the war
I come from the most dangerous city in this universe
You're likely to get shot at birth

K'NAAN,"You don't have to launch your missile to break down my defense
You don't need to find a jet to end our arguments
We don't have to be like everyone to use our common sense
So I guess it's time we burned the documents

'Cause you're crazy I'm crazy and there ain't a thing to lose
Except our pride at suicide of all we've ever knew
And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done
And I feel you're holding on and I'm holding on too
But no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down
The wall is coming down
Down
I see you come around
'Cause the wall is coming down

I don't have to build a fortress to hide what you can't see
I don't have to be the master and hold on to the key
Sometimes I feel so certain that we were meant to be
But I guess it's fine if you disagree

'Cause I'm crazy and you're crazy and there ain't a thing to lose
Except our pride at suicide of all we've ever knew
And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done
And I feel you're holding on and I'm holding on too
But no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down
The wall is coming down
Down
I see you come around
'Cause the wall is coming down

So whenever we turn the wheel peace talking make a deal
You remind me of palace time and I feel so Israel
Look at all the walls I've built and look at all the guards you've killed
And if the gates would open would it be more loving
Or would all my fears turn real 
So for now I suppress your demonstration and I undress you here's the question
This love making a masturbation if every touch feels like instigation
I'm so sure if we all trusted the force of love
Even if our past is awful also break our pride in the torso
Whatever it takes for down these walls go

And somewhere is where east and west and the wall is coming down
Some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done

But when is it ever
I know the perfect time

But you can hurt me tomorrow, okay
It's on you,
Uh hu uh hu, oh yeah, okay

I used to be a strange fruit, Billy Holiday
Then you got me by my roots, took the pain away
I tried to question our direction, that was my mistake
I had to ask you where we going baby, Marvin Gaye
I used to do it like Sinatra, do it my way
Now I'm the Fugee of my Lauren Hill that got away
I though we had an at last love, Etta James
But now I'm wondering

If what I heard it's true
Then I know what you came to do
Love may be blind but I'm looking at you
So before you pull the trigger
Did you ever consider

This ain't a good time
But when is it ever
I know the perfect time
And baby that's never
So don't you dare leave me now

If you can take a rain check on a stormy night
Then I will love you till you're old, like you Betty White
You can hurt me any other day, pick a fight
But not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night
And not the weekend either 'cause I got a song to write
I promise I'mma hear you out when the time is right
Let's have a talk, August 7th, 2099
At your place or mine?

This ain't a good time
But when is it ever
I know the perfect time
And baby that's never
So don't you dare leave me now
Throw my heart on the ground
'Cause tonight ain't the night for sorrow

But you can hurt me tomorrow

Hey! Why you turn around and walk away
I know you got a lot to say
And I really wanna talk about it
Just not today, not today

Is there an instrument to measure all the heart ache in
A looking glass so we can see where all the magic went
I need a button, I can push so we can start again
'Cause girl you bring me to my knees, Nancy Kerrigan

This ain't a good time
But when is it ever
I know the perfect time
And baby that's never
So don't you dare leave me now

I was a leader
Heard life was a beach but
Man I wanna meet her
Swimmin deeper but the grim reaper will always creep up
No ice on my bed, So I never sleep up
Flow Bolt like Usain try n keep up
Way before waving flag in the FIFA
I was a dreamer life was a gamble
Born in a casino, but God never give burdens you can't handle
Music is my ammo I'm ready for battle

When I'm broken down I be brushing off my kicks

I'm only gettin better, better better better
I'm only gettin better, better better better

I've probably always been a sinner

What she wanted so I had to break like the winter
Summer saw me fall Coldplay when I shiver
Spring back up K'naan not a quitter
And success just sex tryna get her wetter
Failing is just an excuse for me to get better

Love means pain
Lust is just a part of it

K'NAAN,"I came out of a killer, neighborhood called River
Where life expectancy is shorter than a caterpillar
I was once a gorilla, and this show was my cage
My trainer was the gauge, AK was my baby sitter
When we be out and looted, the whole city was shooting
I know it's fucked up but somehow, this army came soothing
Niggas heard African rappers and thought about them foofoo
You superman, tell the real soldier boy come to shoot you
Sexual intercourse what you in nigga
Fuck what you heard, yeah nigga
Come walk in the dark no fear nigga
It's a dry in my eyes no tear nigga
Working malaria, your hood can't really compare here
Got keys, they really love barrier
Come near here, I'm daring you
I'll shoot you not being afraid like gave you rock and lemonade
Blew up my school at the 8th grade while playing catch with a hand grenade
Yeap, that's a true story, this ain't Hollywood glory
I ain't the prince of Zamunda my life is too gory

It took my fucking heart from me
I played the judge part pardon if I'm larceny
Oh yeah, that mean it never got no bars for me
T-dot O to the motherfuckering dot B
And the Rexdale project ?
Fuck puck but it ain't no hockey
When the cops came, they knocked me, they got me
I had to flee, they said to bargain, I had to plea
So I crossed the border while they put a warrant out for me

In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there?

Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side

Never felt pretty
Never looked like Cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up

Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes Hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing bac
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?

She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest heart to survive, she said

When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom never took a look at him
Grew up mad and antisocial

Hated outdoors, always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope he puts his arms up higher
I can see him crying out, yeah

There's a light on in your heart
So let it be your guidance, guidance
Open your mouth if what you'd say
Could be more beautiful than silence, silence

OK, ain't it funny how the talkers always talking?
Never firing, but always say they cocking
And they're cocky until they in the parking lots
Suddenly they got Parkinson, they can hardly talk.
No karate buddy, no Pilates buddy
It's a new game, no Atari buddy!
Body chalk, well I'm used to bodies chopped
I've seen shit to give new meaning to the body shop
Look, I know you think I'm so righteous,
But mother fucker, I'm also into rifles
They try to tell these niggas I'm a baby in these diapers
I'm on my own shit, like this
I don't disseminate, I got my name in services
I don't discriminate, I got friends who are snipers
But some of them ended up being lifeless
Cause they kept silent, survivors.

I'm the quiet type, breathe and steady
Never small talk speak when necessary

Death do us part, memories, I marry
Got a library with no lies buried
And all the books look like they're made of strawberries.
It ain't easy being me
Cause my own fans can't relate to my streets
And my streets can't relate to dough in the yeast
But I'm beast, so I make bread on release.
I'm releasing my demons
Give the beat it's life like I gave a fetus semen
Feel the kick in your belly, that's freedom breathing
And don't say nothing, cause now we're dreaming!

Niggas looked corny I admit, we was foreigners
But this corny kid, quick to send you to the coroners
Y’all know my war story, I won’t repeat it
It’s just injury, my victory’s undefeated
Thought you knew me well, go back and delete it
I’m in every joint this year, Orthopedic
And yes the AK’s are instruments we do drum ‘em
I’m somewhere between killa and king Solomon
And the shades take half the face we over stun ‘em
And treat obstacles like ass we overcome ‘em
Man, they really made me do this
I was peaceful like a Buddhist
But then niggas came and screwed it up like Judas
Now I’m suited up with Lugers
Rugers suddenly intruders
Turn around like hoola hoopers
