Alice Cooper,"Take another bite
It'll be alright
What's wrong will soon feel right
Dangerous tonight

Take another sip
Let it kiss your lips
And let a little drip on your thighs

If you let me I'll untie your sensuality
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed

[Chorus:]
I'm dangerous, I'm a dying breed
Poisonous like a centipede
I'm capable of the foulest deed
Dangerous at night
I'm dangerous like a razorback
Deadly like a heart attack
Well, I don't bend and I don't crack
Dangerous tonight

Take another turn
The rules have all been burned
And you've got tricks to learn
Dangerous tonight

Play another role
Try and lose control
And stain your soul to red from white
In my mind, oh, a million voices tell me no
It's prime crime time and I gotta let it go

I'm dangerous like a broken glass
I'm a flesh fanatic psychopath
I can cause you pain and make it last
Dangerous tonight
I'm dangerous when the sun goes down
So cross yourself, don't fool around
I'll drag your heart into the ground
Dangerous tonight

If you let me I'll untie your sensuality
I'll open up your heart and satisfy my greed

[Chorus]

I'm dangerous like a broken glass
I'm a blood bubonic psychopath
I can cause you pain and make it last
Dangerous tonight",Dangerous Tonight
Alice Cooper,"A hundred numbers on my wall
Some with namesI sometimes call
I dropa coin and watch it fall
Tryin' to get connected to you

A thousand hours all alone
My softest pillow turns hard as stone
This is the longest night on my own

Sometimes I shake my head
And laugh to myself
I'd like start again with somebody Ellis
I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the self

Baby, I could have been someone
I could have been something
It would have been nothing to die for you
Baby, you're going to need me
You'd better believe me
It would have been easy to die for you

A milloin memories flood my brain
Drown my sorrow
Kill my pain
Whets my thirst for you again
Just another night to get through

All my neighbors scream for quite at my door
Shattered glass and torn up photos on
Thrown on the floor
Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures
Anymore

Baby, I could have been someone
I could have been something
It would have been nothing to die for you
Baby, you're going to need me
You'd better believe me
It would have been easy to die for you

These cuts are deep but you plead
Innocent
Are you hell or are you heaven-sent
You're much too cold to know how much
You ment to me, Yeah

A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes
but it's just a joke now
And 
I'm laughing at your lies

You made me hard as rock and now
I realize

Baby, I could have been someone
I could have been something
It would have been nothing to die for you
Baby, you're going to need me
You'd better believe me
It would have been easy to die for you",Die for You
Alice Cooper,"Well, I wake up burnin' in a soaking sweat
My pillows are drippin' and the sheets are wet
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light
This happens to me every night
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair
You can turn yourself blue and I don't care
You can change your look
You can change your race
But it's always your touch
And always your face

[Chorus:]
Dirty dreams
How you want to do me
Dirty dreams
Let me get through
Dirty dreams
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you

Well, I close my eyes
And you open your lips
There's a shock from my head to my fingertips
I fall through a hole 'cause I can't get a grip
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn

Dirty dreams
How you want do me
Dirty dreams
Anything for you, babe
Dirty dreams
Technicolor movie starring me and you
Make my dreams come true

Shake my nights
Rattle my sleep
Roll my eyes, I'm in too deep

[Chorus]",Dirty Dreams
Alice Cooper,"Yes, yes, I know your hungry
Ah, and here comes dinner

""Feed my Frankenstein""

Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
And baby start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But I don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then I'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers 
Up your greasy spine

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
""He's a psycho""
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time

You don't want to talk
So baby shut up
And let me drink the wine from your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on your ice cream cone

Alice Cooper,"Hey bro, take it slow 
You ain't livin' in a video 
You're flying low with a high velocity 
No doubt, you're stressin' out 
That ain't what rock n' roll's about 
Get off that one way trip down lonely street 

Now I know you've been kicked around 
You ain't alone in this ugly town 
You stick a needle in your arm 
You bite the dust, you buy the farm 

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid 
What ya tryin' to do 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid 
They win you lose 
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid 

C'mon girl, it's a better day 
Get your foot out of that grave 
Don't let that one love tear your world apart 
C'mon babe, kick that stuff 
Show the street it ain't so tough 
Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart 

Now I know you've been seeing red 
Don't put a pistol to your head 
sometimes your answer's heaven sent 
Your way is so damn permanent 

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid 
What ya tryin' to do 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey stoopid 
They win you lose 
Hey, hye, hey, hey, hey stoopid

Alice Cooper,"I got a ticket to nowhere
I got no respect for the law
I got no use 'cause it's all abuse
It's the cutting edge of the saw

Ain't got no tiime for the future
Ain't got no time for the past
I'm running up a down escalator
I'm going nowhere fast

I'm hanging on like a spider
Blowing in the wind
This storm's gonna tear a hole
Right through this web I'm in

[Chorus:]
Thunder lightning
The wind outside is so damn frightening
But it's alright, all right
Stand clear
You're living in the hurricane years
In the hurricane years

I've been through major destruction
I've seen through terrorists' eyes
Sometims I feel no emotion
Sometims I break down and cry
I need to walk on a wire
I need a layer of skin
I need a preacher breathing fire
To burn away my sins

And I can't help the victims
On the side of the road
And I can't stop the cyclone
That's about to explode

[Chorus]

Turn my eyes to heaven
Watching all the clouds roll by
I see the blood moon rising
I know I'm way too young to die

[Chorus]",Hurricane Years
Alice Cooper,"Black leather gloves and your lipstick shines
Bright as moonlight glows
My wildest rose cuts so fine and deep
It hurts but never shows
You're bad, you're so hardcore
Pull me down here on the killing floor

[Chorus:]
Little by little we cross the line
Little by little the ties that bind
Little by little by little by little
Little by little tonight

Your sugar tongue speaks hot and sweet
Lying just for fun
Push and shove
Sex is sex
But honey, love is love
We're not sick insane
Just another lovers' game

[Chorus]

I'm all undone
My pretty one
Don't slap my face
Unless you kiss me

[Chorus]

You beg and you cry for more
You pull me down here on the killing floor

[Chorus]",Little by Little
Alice Cooper,"Somebody saw you at the station
You had your suitcase in your hand
You didn't give no information
You walked off with another man
I'm always standing in the shadows, baby
I watched you give yourself away
You take them home into your bedroom
You had another busy day

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits
I can't take it

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Someday they'll put me in a squad car
Someday they'll throw away the key
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog
'Cause that's what you taught me to be

You looked into the eyes of men above you
I was the one who really tried to love you

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill
Pull the trigger

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You know, you push me right to the limit
I can't take it

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

Somebody saw you at the station",Love's a Loaded Gun
Alice Cooper,"The city streets are wet with rain tonight
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall
Midnight blues comin' through the walls

I tried to call you on the telephone
I left it off the hook
Just to hear it ring
You told me you were better off alone
I never knew that tears could stain

I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all the cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach you is just too far
And I might as well be on mars

The city seems so old and grey and beat
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate
And you just live across the street
But that's a billion miles away

You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are
But I'm right in your backyard
And I might as well be on mars

I might as well be on mars
You can't see me
I might as well be the man on the moon
You can't hear me
Oh, can you feel me so close
And yet so far
Baby, I might as well be on mars

Baby, I can't fly
If I could I'd come down to ya
Maybe I should try

I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all lthe cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach is just too far
And I might as well be on mars

I might as well be on mars
You can't see me
I might as well be the man on the moon
You can't hear me
Oh, can you feel me so close
And yet so far
Baby, I might as well be on mars",Might as Well Be on Mars
Alice Cooper,"Somebody better shake you
Somebody better turn your head around
I'm scratching like a wild cat
I'm spitting fire on the ground

You got my venom running thru ya
Ain't gonna let you run off wild

I'm snakebite
I'm your only man
Snakebite is your lover
You'll never hide, baby understand
Snakebite drags you under
I'm snakebite
They call me Snakebite

Nobody gonna take you
Nobody gonna touch your rebel skin
I'll break 'em like a little matchstick
'Cause baby that's the kind of mood I'm in

My face is tattooed in your shoulder
Your name is scratched into my bike, yeah

I'm snakebite
I'm your only man

Alice Cooper,"Voices come from down the hall
In my room all painted white
I have my bat and rubber ball
I like to sleep with them at night

But now I'm all smiles
The good little shots must be winning
Yes, they crank my dial
My motor is stalled but my wheels are still spinning

Daddy won't discuss me
What a state I must be
Mommy couldn't stand living with a wind-up toy

All my friends live on the floor
Tiny legs and tiny eyes
They're free to crawl under the door
And, and someday soon so will I

But now I'm all smiles
These good little shots must be working
I'm so happy now
Look, my fingers don't shake and my head isn't jerking

Daddy won't discuss me
What a pain I must be
Mommy couldn't stand having such a wound-up boy

Doctors want to check me
Poke me and dissect me
What do they expect?
Feelings from a wound-up toy?
I don't think so
I'm just a wound-up toy
I'm just a wind-up toy

I'm lost in a nightmare
Shiny white halls
Drawing rats on the wall
Solitary confinement
Chained in a cell
Got my own private Hell

Preacher crucifies me
Warden wants to fry me
I was never young
Never just a little boy

Daddy won't discuss me
What a pain I must be
Mama couldn't stand having such a wound-up boy

What a way for one too realize
Gotta waste a bore now I see
How he is so happy feeling sad

Alice Cooper,"I got my invitation to the annual levity ball
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind
I sat down at the stairway seven hours at a time
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme
The memory I know I must have had when I came in
Was of some place I'd never ever been
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name
The clock was passing out from time to time
I saw it all at the beginning of the ending of my first levity ball",Levity Ball
Alice Cooper,"I'm changing, arranging
Things I never thought I'd move before
I'm changing, arranging
To your personality I asked for it before
I need a soul who'll never say what I feel
Just fearing that I will accept the ideal
I look up high and I swear all I see
It's a carbon copy image of me
I'm dying hard trying
Baby, baby, for the rest of my life
I'm trying hard dying
Maybe, maybe he's trying to be my life
I've got a never ending battle inside
Just trying to rectify my personal pride
I swear I don't know what it's got over me
But I know it doesn't want to be free","Changing, Arranging"
Alice Cooper,"Man's got his woman to take his seed
He's got the power - oh
She's got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break

He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain

She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Alice Cooper,"Crazy little child
Never got to see
All the pretty things in life
Had him put away
Nothing they could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Aw well, Daddy-o was rich
Mama was a bitch
Living wasn't easy in between
Behind his silent scream
Jackson in his teens
Was planning his escape

[Chorus]
He was a crazy little child
New Orleans Alley playground
Grimy faced
He watched the hookers cry
Winos were his friends	And when he talked to them
They said, ""Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by""

Depression settin' in
Desp'rate, cool and quick
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street
Little candy stores
Just pickin'' locks and doors
Was practice for a two bit petty thief

So Jackson went to Ritz
And ev'ryone was hip
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town
If you need another boy
A trigger or a blade
Well, I'm the slickest cat around

Yeah, Ritz gave him the eye
Once over, then he smiled
""Yeah, I've got something here in mind
If you meet me here at two
I think you'll like the view
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight""

[Chorus]

Well, I'll wait for you outside
And I'll be your ears and your eyes
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot
But Ritz was taken by surprise
Couple of unspectin' guys
And they left poor Jackson inside

Questions there were few
In fact there were none
When those Sheriff's bullets start to fly
Lay dying on the floor
With a smokin' forty four
He said, ""I must admit the winos were right""

Crazy little child
Never got to see
All the pretty things in life
We buried him today
Nothing we could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Yeah, I must admit the winos were right

Well, I must have come to that crazy age
Where ev'rything is hot

Are normal thoughts or not

Well, I got a muscle of love

And I rip off all the money
I was kicked in the teeth
Shoved face first through a window
I got a gangland name
And a teardrop tattooed eye
They call me Little Caesar in the
Brotherhood of crime
I know about the pain
Dying in an alley with an
Air-conditioned brain
I know, it's for real
Flat lined in an ambulance
Without a pulse to feel

You're as sharp as a razor
And as hard as a stone

They call me Smoky Joe
And I'm as thin as a coroner's needle
I got a pocket full of rocks
Man, I shake like a cold chihuahua
I got a runny nose
And a road map on my arm
I blew my gig poking around the gallery
With someone else's rig
I know, I understand
I watch my body hauled off
By the local garbage man

We're cool, we're cold
We're stiff, we're tagged
We're slabbed, we're croaked
We're whacked, we're cracked

Slammed and slurred and
Sliced and diced and put on ice
Cooked and stewed and badly brewed
And splattered once or twice

Alice Cooper,"I was the boy who said all of my prayers
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure
Through the night
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing
It pulled me right out of a dream
If I knew it was you
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream
 
I am the one who growls in your closet
I am the one who lives under your bed

[Chorus]
Get down, back where you started
Get down, back into hell
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted
I smell your sulfurous smell
 
All of my things that I play with in daylight
You turn into monsters at night
My toys were my friends
Until you taught them all how to bite
 
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see
You scared me with visions of fire
You danced on my bed
With the flames on your head dancing higher
 
I am the one who growls in your closet
I am the one who lives under your bed
 
[Chorus]
 
I tell you right now
I don't want your reptile embrace
I don't want to follow you down to your place
I don't want to be a child of disgrace
You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming
at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face

I was the boy who said all of my prayers
Laid my clean face on the pillow
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure

Free to take your fill
Free from your own free will

I'll raise the stakes
So close
Control your fate, why hesitate
Seal the deal, close the sale
Take my hammer, drive the nail

Nothing's free
Eternally
Nothing's free
 
From your conscience or
Free from the consequence
Free to sin and death
Free till your final breath
Nothing's free
Free from the claws and flaws of your family
Free from obedient life
You're cut like a double-edged knife
Nothing's free, nothing's free
Oh, you pay me
 
Free to ignore the bore of authority
Free to spit in the face
Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day
Then nothing's free
Bow to me if you want to be free
Free from life, come die with me
And when we're dead it's for eternity
 
Come on little one and dance in the fire

and the flame's getting higher
When the music's over there's a hush in the choir

And man makes your hair gray, I'm your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break
I lie right at her you know you hate this game
I slaps her once in a while she live and love in pain

She cries alone at night too often
And I smoke and drink I don't come home at all

New names and faces can bring
Build ups and barriers hiding behind everything

Who lies and who tries to come over everyone

Alice Cooper,"I got my invitation to the annual levity ball 
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room 
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find 
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind 
I sat down on the stairway seven hours at a time 
Writing all of this poetry that I knew would never rhyme 
The memory I knew I must have had when I came in 
Was of some varied places where I've never ever been 
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name 
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name 
The clock was passing out from time to time I saw it all 
The beginning of the ending of my first levity ball",Levity Ball [Studio Version][#]
Alice Cooper,"Crazy little child never got to see
All the pretty things in life
Had him put away, nothing they could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Aw well, daddy-o was rich, mama was a bitch
Living wasn't easy in between
Behind his silent scream, Jackson in his teens
Was planning his escape

He was a crazy little child, New Orleans Alley playground
Grimy faced, he watched the hookers cry
Winos were his friends and when he talked to them
They said, Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by

Depression settin' in, desperate, cool and quick
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street
Little candy stores, just pickin' locks and doors
Was practice for a two bit petty thief

So Jackson went to Ritz and everyone was hip
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town
If you need another boy, a trigger or a blade
Well, I'm the slickest cat around

Ritz gave him the eye, once over then he smiled
Yeah, I've got something here in mind
If you meet me here at two, I think you'll like the view
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight

He was a crazy little child, New Orleans Alley playground
And grimy faced, he watched the hookers cry, whoo
Winos were his friends and when he talked to them
They said, Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by, that's right

Well, I'll wait for you outside and I'll be your ears and your eyes
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot
But Ritz was taken by surprise, couple of unsuspectin' guys
And they left poor Jackson inside

Questions there were few, in fact there were none
When those sheriff's bullet start to fly
Lay dying on the floor with a smokin' forty-four
He said, I must admit the winos were right

Crazy little child, never got to see
All the pretty things in life
We buried him today, nothing we could say
Could ever make the pieces fit

Yeah, I must admit the winos were right
Oh, I must admit the winos were right

Alice Cooper,"We're spinning round on this ball of hate
There's no parole, there's no great escape
We're sentenced here until the end of days
And then my brother there's a price to pay

We're only human, we were born to die
Without the benefit of reason why
We live for pleasure to be satisfied
And now it's over there's no place to hide

Why don't you, come down to
It's such a brutal planet
It's such an ugly world
Why won't you, come down to

""This world is such perfection"" (What a sight)
""It's just like paradise"" (For your eyes)
""A truly grand creation"" (What a sight)
""From up here it looks so nice"" (For my eyes)

It's such a brutal planet
It's such a living hell
It was a holy garden
That's right where Adam fell
It's where the bite was taken
It's where we chose to sin
It's where we first were naked
This is where our death begins

We took advice from that deceiving snake
He said ""don't worry it's a piece of cake""
And sent us swimming in a burning lake
Now we're abandoned here for heaven's sake

Why don't you, come down to

""From up here it looks so nice"" (For my eyes)

Here's where we keep the armies
Here's where we write their names
Here's where the money god is
Here's our famous hall of shame
Here's where we starve the hungry
Here's where we cheat the poor
Here's where we beat the children
Here is where we pay the whores

Right here we stoned the prophets
Built idols out of mud
Right here we fed the lions
Christian flesh and Christian blood
Down here is where we hung him
Upon an ugly cross
Over there we filled the ovens
Right here the holocaust",Brutal Planet

Spoiling in the stinking heat
Train loads full of moldy bread
Millions will still go unfed

Acres full of dying wheat
Burning brightly at our feet
A billion tons of ocean fish
Some with nothing on their dish

We can't see, we're going blind
We're just dying on the vine
We're all sinking from the weight
Open wide and salivate

Do you like the taste?
Stuff it in your face
Its not nice to waste
We're not happy 'til we're choking
So we eat some more
Throw up on the floor
Go back to the store
We're so hungry, so pathetic

Lots of melting cheddar cheese
Spreading it's unique disease
Rotting veggies on the ground
Where little hungry little kids are found

Worms in fruit an ugly sight
They're begging for a single bite

While other people sadly die

This one has a skull but it don't have a face
These look like the arms of father so strong
And the ring on this finger means my Grandma is gone

Here's some legs in a cloud where my sister once played
Here's some mud made of blood and these teeth are decayed
The ear of my brother, The hand of a friend
And I just can't put them back together again

Pick up the bones and set them on fire
Follow the smoke going higher and higher
Pick up the bones and wish them goodnight
Pray 'em a prayer and turn out the light

There are stains on the floor where kitchen once stood
There are ribs on the fire place mixed with the wood
There are forces in the air, ghosts in the wind
Some bullets in the back and some scars on the skin

There were demons with guns who marched through this place
Killing everything that breathed, they're an inhuman race
There are holes in the walls, bloody hair on the bricks
And the smell of this hell is making me sick

Alice Cooper,"You were so beautiful
Like a child young and full of life
Seems a hundred years ago
You saw everything
So much more tragedy than good
You even watched the world grow cold
And even when your world was shaken'
Even when your breath was taken
Even when your blue eyes turned to grey

Small town debutantes and queens
Every woman has a name
Cocktail waitresses with dreams
Every woman has a name
And every girl who's loves survives
A broken heart to stay alive
You signed your picture in the frame
Every woman has a name

You had a love affair
Some of were perfect
but most of them were pain
It seems a hundred years ago
It took you to the highest hill
Left you standing frozen in the rain
But you still feel the afterglow
And even when your world was shakin'
Even when your breath was taken
Even when your blue eyes turned to gray

Housewives cryin' on the phone
Every woman has a name
Sacred sisters all alone
Every woman has a name
And even on the coldest day
When the kids are gone, moved away
It's lonely now
There's no one there to hold your hand
And play

See it written on the grave
Every woman has a name",Every Woman Has a Name

When I go to the show all I see on the screen is a stream of pure vulgarity
I wrote down a note, I complained for a day to the House of Representatives
They laughed in my face, they said ""Son, you're a one-in-a-million minority""
The name of the game is to titillate the brain, stimulate the immorality

I was so offended as I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty, I was so shocked

Just a little more blood
Little closer to the edge

Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley
Loves me like no other lover

Man or woman living couldn't love me like you, baby

While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough, tell me
I'm so scared your little head will come off in my hands

I got you in the dimestore
No other little girl could ever hold you
Any tighter, any tighter than me, baby

Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fightin' like dog that's been infected by the rabies

Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never felt this way before

Walk in the bathroom and I take a deep breath
Look in the mirror and it scares me to death
Look like a junkie that's been strung out on meth
Since I met you

I can't eat
I can't sleep
I feel sick
I'm so weak

Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never felt this way before

Love should never feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I never felt this way before 

Oh, ignorance was always bliss
Love should never feel like this

Love should never, ever feel like this
I've never felt this way before
I must be doing something wrong
No, Love should never, ever feel like this
I must be doing something wrong
I've never, ever felt this way before

Alice Cooper,"I wake up every morning, Six o'clock, I'm right on time
I eat a low fat breakfast, I tie a perfect tie
I kiss the wife, I hug the kids, I pat the dogs and cats
I never lose anything, my car keys or my hat

'Cause I'm the man of the year
I'm the man of the year

I never cheat at finals, or miss a day at school
My urine tests are perfect, my prostate is a jewel

'Cause I'm the man of the year
I'm the man of the year
'Cause I'm the man of the year
I'm never, ever jealous
Never, ever cruel
I'm a graduate of Harvard
Where I never broke the rules

The queen made me a knight
The pope made me a saint
The president plays golf with me
I make Madonna faint

So why am I so lonely
Depressed and in despair
If I pull this trigger in my mouth will anybody care

It was the greatest funeral, I laid in perfect state
And later I will meet the lord, I bet he just can't wait

To meet the man of the year
I'm the man of the year
Stand in line to meet the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man",Man of the Year
Alice Cooper,"When I was 10, fell out of bed
Got three stitches in my head
It hurt like hell
I saw the blood, I felt the pain
I'd like to feel it once again
'Cause I don't feel it

Then I got stung, right on the face
I screamed and ran around the place
It hurt like hell
I swoll right up, I burned for days
I'd like to feel it once again

'Cause when you touch me
When you hold me
When you kiss me
I don't feel anything
When you touch me
When you hold me
When you kiss me

I remember every cut and scrape
I've been numb so long
Something's wrong
So I'll take anything

I slap my face, I pull my hair
Just to see if something's there
It should hurt like hell
I miss the pinch, I miss the pain
That shock sensation in my brain

'Cause when you touch me
When you hold me
When you kiss me
I don't feel anything
When you touch me
When you hold me
When you kiss me

Alice Cooper,"Wrote a song, it was wrong from it's very first conception
Seemed I struggled on every line
It wasn't fast, wasn't pretty, wasn't serious or witty
The song that didn't rhyme

The band couldn't wing it, the singer couldn't sing it
The drummer's always out of time
The DJ's were offended, my union card suspended
Billboard declared it a crime

The melody blows in a key that no one can find
The lyrics don't flow but I can't get it out of my mind
A three minute waste of your time
On a song that didn't rhyme 

It was bland, it was boring, all the groupies there were snoring
The first time we played it live
All the record guys got fired, the president retired
But somehow the song survived

The melody blows in a key that no one can find
The lyrics don't flow but I can't get it out of my mind
The melody blows in a key that no one can find
The lyrics don't flow but I can't get it out of my mind

No way
Spirits rebellious, we won't do anything you say

It's a hard, hard world with a black corroded heart
There's a livin', breathin' devil trying to tear my soul apart

Never listen to advice, I was never that bright
Couldn't walk away, I was lookin' to fight

Alice Cooper,"I was sitting in my room, dark and gray and crying
Someone in my life I fear was at the point of dying
A cold wind blew right up my spine, it was the break of dawn
A little voice went deep inside told me she was gone

Oh this house is haunted
Oh that's how I want it to be
Oh this house is haunted
You can always stay here with me

No more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days
She left and took the colors with her, buried in her grave
This is where we climbed the tower, this is where she fell
Then when her young heart stopped beating, I went to hell

Oh this house is haunted
Oh ha
Oh this house is haunted
Ho oh

I feel you sit down on the couch right here next to me

Alice Cooper,"I call you every hour on the telephone

I've given you everything
Baby, what do you want from me!

[Chorus:]
I burned all my porno...'cause you were PMS'n
You say it offends you...all that talking it never ends

Dumped all my girlfriends...even the dirty ones
You think they annoy you...they want to destroy you
I'm givin' you everything
Baby, what do you want from me!

Got you a picture you can put in a frame
Wearing a suit all check and lame
I even signed it at the bottom so you'd 'member my name

Got you an autographed Buns Of Steel
So what a deal!

Or are you just a noble guy
Who dresses like a butterfly

Facing every redneck in that one horse town

He threw his coke, and he got me drenched

Or are you just an average Joe, looking for a fashion show

Well I guess that was the final straw
I pulled a pistol from my wonder bra
I killed 'em dead heh, I killed 'em all
But then they caught me in the bathroom stall
And Now I'm doing ten to life

Alice Cooper,"She was a dirty dream cool and clean
With seduction dancing in her eyes
She turned around looked me up and down
She took me by surprise

I tried to run tried to hide
But my feet were made of clay
Looked in her eyes I was paralyzed
I just couldn't get away

She licked her lips they were bloody red
She had the heart of the living dead
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven but instead
She turned her head and she softly said

I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off
I'll bite your face off little man
I'll bite your face off you know that I can

She put the whip into cream
She was a sinners queen oh a delicious angel face
She'd invite you in c'mon and lick my skin
You'd sell your soul for another taste

She took my heart my resistance fled
I loved each lie that I was fed
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven but instead
She turned her head and she softly said

I just woke up in lonely town
I opened up my eyes and much to my surprise
Look at this heaven that I've found
Don't need to care about tomorrow
I got no pain, I got no sorrow

I'm the last man on earth
So tell me what it's worth
Am I a beggar or a king?
Got no trouble, got no time,
Eternity is mine
I got a whole lot of everything

I can take this town
And just burn it to the ground
Smash every window that I see
I can smoke, I can drink,
I can swear, an' I can stink
There ain't no one to bother me
No, no

Alice Donut,"How I love to sleep
I was back in Mahomet, Illinois,
A Mongoloid child played with
A bright orange smurf ball

Gurgling to himself contentedly
Next to a tree. In the middle
Of the street stood a small
Repulsive chihuahua-like beast with

Huge bulging lascivious eyes and sickly
Liver spotted skin. It lifted its tail
And I saw a strange puckered
Cuntlike orafice with a tongue.

The beast started whispering to me
Beckoning to me. Mongo started jumping
Up and down screaming. The neighbors
Ran to their trailor homes and locked

Their doors. I was possessed.
I picked up the beast and
Fucked it with uncontrolled lust.
It turned its head and leered at

Me as I pumped it again and again.
It started laughing. Suddenly a sharp
Striking pain shot deep into my bowels.
I pulled out. The beast, still laughing

Deposited a milky afterbirth substance
Then ran into the woods. At the base of
My penis, the beast's sphincter was
Clamped down hard. I cut it off with a

Boyscout knife. The neighbors stared
From their windows. ""Look at me!"" I screamed
""I fuck your neighborhood pets!""
I went home and hid inside my room.

From the window I saw a police car next
To the afterbirth in the street. A fat redneck
Cop waddled out of the squad car bent over
Picked up a nugget of placenta sniffed it and

Said, ""Yep it's been fucked get out an A.P.B.
Immediately!"" I locked the doors. My belly hurt
More and more. My cock turned grey and liverspotted
Like the beast. I squeezed the head and a parasitic

Blood worm oozed out. I grabbed the worm
And pulled it out slowly. Layers of skin from
My belly to my upper thighs dissolved as I
Pulled the worm. Like an onion, layer

After layer of epidermis melted off my body with
Each tug of the worm. I woke up.
I was pissing straight up into the air through
The semi-erect tissue of a descending piss boner.

It splashed against my stomach and thighs.

All of your words were high there but I told myself I had not found love, once again
Tell me it's all in my head, tell me I imagined all of it
That there's no one else, so don't worry, but were always wiser in the end

Go on and lie to my face
Tell me again how you love me while kissing another girl
Lie to my face
Say that you need me, without us there's no other way
Tell me this won't ever end
Tell me it over and over again
Lie to me my friend

I saw you looking and her, you said you were friends but I know that you weren't
What is a girl meant to do, when she discovers a man is a fool
I know she's playing with you, but this ain't a game, I thought this here was true

So go on and lie to my face
Tell me again how you love me while kissing another girl

I check the rear view mirror and there you are

I'm happy were I am with the choices I've made
But sometimes I can feel you like you're next to me

Like fields of forever

I don't know if at seventeen

You can ever see beyond the dream
Or the beat of your heart
Flush in your face, it had to be true
Like the love with the boy in the backseat I knew

After graduation we went our separate ways
I flew off to college, you just drove away
With plans of traveling this great big world of ours
And throughout the years I'd see your eyes
On strangers faces, on other guys
From small cafes to dark Midwestern bars

But the boy in the backseat had miles to go
From the isle of Antigua to the Vancouver coast
Every now and then a postcard home
Friends say you're married, all I know

Is the beat of my heart
Flush in my face
It had to be true
Like the love with the boy in the backseat I knew

Everyone you ever love is a part of you

And the boy in the backseat with eyes of green
Like fields of forever do you know what I mean
In the rose colored world of seventeen
Real life can never touch that dream

And the boy in the backseat won't ever change
Time passes by, the radio plays
On that lost and misty lover's lane

The sound of the night, the sound of the rain
And the beat of your heart
Flush in your face, it had to be true

But, will it be enough when it's time to save us.
One in three can't read, so many mouths to feed,
We just sit and wait like a loaded gun,
We cloak ourselves in the great tradition,
The United States of acquisition.

Every man for himself, it's just me and no one else,
Will we ever learn there's a price to pay.

America the free, wake up from your fantasy,
Is the nation so divided we can't see.
That there's work to be done, somethin' there for everyone,
I know, I'll start with me.

Six o'clock it's another story, gunman down in a blaze of glory,
Only ten years old, makes my blood run cold,
And the press descends like birds of prey.

Politicians stay in office, far too long to vote their conscience,
Lobbied, bought and sold, trading votes for gold,
They've forgotten that they work for us.

Is the nation so divided we can't see.
That there's work to be done, somethin' there for everyone,

That's why in times of peace, they create an enemy,
What we called the big, red scare is just my neighbor over there,
With hopes and dreams, the same as me.

So I wouldn't miss the turn
On a moonless light with your flashlight
I was touched by your concern

How you knew me when I was a girl
All mixed up about the world
And I guess it's fair to say
We're so alike in many ways
You're my northern star

The by the highway sort
And we'd make love for hours and hours
On the couch in your front porch

And you were gone the next summer you went so far away
And I guess you thought we were dangerous

How I can get through this life without you
When you're just a memory

I think the weekends may be worst
All that time, it's a curse
I've saved your message on my phone
Makes me feel not so all alone
I pray to God that he will see me through
And maybe in time I'll get over you

For once in my life
I had a love
The love of my dreams
And that was enough",Only a Memory
Alice Peacock,"Watching the waves wash across the sand
Sharing a smoke as I hold your hand
You're here, with me there's no where else
I'd rather be

This is the best day I've ever had
Just for the day let's runaway
Won't you play with me
Down by the sea I'll show you how happy
We can be

Let's just drift away on our runaway day
My baby works hard he works all day
Sometimes at night I can hear him say
I wish, we could, go back in time
When things were good
You know we don't have to live this way

Whenever I'm blue, I know what to do
I want to go runaway with you
Ain't a cloud in the sky
I'm feeling so high
With you by my side, by my side",Runaway Day
Alice Peacock,"You hate to be ignored
Or maybe you're just bored
So I opened up my mail and there's a note from you
You say you're checkin' in
To see how I have been
Hey I'm doing so much better if you'd like to know the truth
You taught me well
You were my teacher and I thank you
For the hell you put me through I'm very grateful
'Cause I finally really learned what was important
In my life

And I thank my lucky stars everyday I'm not your wife
You're selfishly absorbed
You're childish and a bore
And I used to hold the anger in my stomach like a fist
But in time it was quite clear
That only I was suffering here
And having gratitude for you was the way out of this

You taught me well,that life is for living
It's not about taking, it's all about giving
You taught me well that sometimes what we
Want is staring us right in the face
And the power of forgiveness, the power of
Grace, of grace",Taught Me Well
Alice Peacock,"And so I wept and raged and cried
And came through on the other side
I thought what is this that dissolves to dust
What remains of the two of us
You have left an empty space
A memory that's hard to trace
A momentary flash of light
In Time
And all across the universe
Everything expanding
At once a blessing and a curse
A beginning and an ending
I don't know the mystery
Of why we're here or how we came to be
I think we're measured by our heart
If we've been kind and done our part
Will anyone remember me?
I guess my friends, my family
We're intertwined - their lives and mine
In Time
And all around the world tonight
People are embracing
Cause it's all about the love you give
And you don't want to waste it
Time
",Time
Alice Peacock,"I don't want to play your game
That everyone should be the same
I know who I am
Don't need your philosophy
It isn't any use to me
I know where I stand
In the ways of life and art
I trust the wisdom of my heart
I may stumble, I may fall
But I know that through it all
If to my own self I am true
Than I'm sure to make it through
It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause I know I'll be okay
I know who I am
I may not be your fantasy
Or what you think I'm 'sposed to be
Well I understand
But what you clearly fail to see
Is there's nobody else quite like me
In this wonderland
My luck begins with these two hands
'Cause nothing happens just by chance

I'm courageous, I am kind, a contradiction in
Your mind, my sexuality belongs to no one else
But me, I believe that love's a choice
I trust the power in my voice",Who I Am
Alice Ripley,"If we're to be the light
That shines for all of man
Then how can we light the way
If we don't go to them

I believe to know God's heart
Is to meet them where they are
Won't you shine on
Won't you shine on

You can shine on
Shine on
In all that's said and done
And everything you do

Just let your life glorify
The one who shines on you
I believe we worship Christ
When we show the world His light

Won't you shine on
Won't you shine on
You can shine on

Alice Ripley,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road
Alice Russell,"The birds have stopped their song, they know its time to go
The trees have dropped their leaves on the silent roads
The boys put down their arrows and the bows and the
Clouds have moved aside for the sun to dim its glow

the river dried up & the oceans with the sea
The stars put out their lights and closed the galaxy
They shut the mountains & the valleys on the way
They packed up Africa, Brazil, Bombay, cos its

final
You should go
But its fine now
They all know

its over now

and now the west winds are so slow they hardly blow
And the chill outsides too cold even for snow
The houses packed up the streets left long ago
From here to vience beach, milan, & the congo

take a while to stand outside there'll be no rain
I don't know if I can start all this again
Will the world return to me intime the same
From here to italy, norway & spain cos its

You should go
But its fine now
They all know",All Over Now

And I know that they will still be there when
I get those feelings need to run go hide

I'm getting lost in, with you every day now
Or just sitting quietly side by side
Climbing towers and getting mystery trains now
Making tea and settling down
Kites ice creams jumping jumping trampolines now

Seeing things that no one else has seen now

I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are
Having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy

To lose their lives out on a limb

Alice Russell,"Citizens of planet earth don't get caught in the act
Don't strive to destruction the flash it's just that
There's something behind these walls, something under the sheets, I stay
A truth that's been locked in way down in me

You've got to get up, around your space
And take a, take a little time to contemplate
Will we ever see what it's like behind these walls
And are you, are you still moving up every time you fall, stop

Think a little about what you got
Stop, think a little about what you got
And start again

And you, you
You could be me, me

We dance, we breathe for, we may change and all it is
Remember that we are what we are and all we are
We dance, we breathe for, we may change and all it is

So in the answer lies the question
The subject that we started all along
My mind didn't feel so open
Imagination filling up my soul

So we don't know what we doing
We do know that's what we should believe
But it makes no difference of what you see inside

So don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence
Don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence

Don't know where you're coming
Don't know where you're going too
You can't tie down an angel
A picture of life it's true

When rain drops come and go
The different never hide
Where you lose yourself
You find your mind

So don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence
Don't you see you're not so different
Take yourself back to innocence

So don't you see you're not so different

Chew my mind up caught you asleep
But is it ever meant to be rough
In time, upon the crest of a wave

Big wave, big sharks, big as your fingers
Won't sit and spill to the next
Let's get down quiet on the moment
Inside you beat it, boy and before

We find ourselves back again
And eat us up, 3012

So no I won't serve it up

But that's just bitter of you
'Cause you are sad inside
If you were me for a while

I so love you
It's dead inside
It's on, my heart
And I, I'm sending
Out for more high
Always comes to the
Same we started at the bottom
So let's meet at the top my friend
It's no use sending, pretending that
If anyone else would ever come close to you

If a broken heart is what you give
Remember, then a broken heart is what you get

It's a red beaded knuckle but it's keeping us alive
Each day we always struggle with the thought of what's inside
Today's simple kisses, will be loaded with regret

When it falls, when it breaks
Who spills right open
When it falls, when it breaks
Smash it to the ground
When it falls, when it breaks
The landscape all for love escape
When it falls, when it breaks
Huuuu
When it falls, when it breaks

Then a broken heart is what you get
If a broken heart is what you give

When we were young
With wild hearts
And wild souls
Beneath the dreams
An open sea
A life for miles
Stretched out before

I miss your voice
And how it felt
We had it whole
With wild souls
You were away
Across the sea
You left a cry

But now I know
How it feels when it's cold
As the winter rose in to your heart
And the tears row with words
Don't you long for the start
Long for the start

I loved you
Hanging on to these words I feel you let me by
I feel you
Hanging on to these words I feel you

So looking back
You went this way
Got caught in the wind
That blue way
But while its souls
Tell fruit for tales
A city's long

Jazz away them blues

Still got my fake
But it's gettin loud
Now all these voices
Keep spinning round

Still above my skate
But a place in mind
He's closing me in
Such words that grind

I'm familiar Jenny
Missed them signs
I bare my positions
Flip over time

I'm trying not to break down
I'm holding on too tight now
Let go
Let go
I'm holding on too tight now

I'll breakdown
All eyes on me
I see you right
Right inside of me

Tell my back I'll be back too
'Cause there's not much to lose
I'll beep my past
Still my blood beats blue

I'm trying not to break down
I'm holding on too tight now
Let go
Let go
I'm holding on too tight now

Alice Russell,"I don't make no money
I tell you nothing about that, so strange
I stand here with my tears rolling down
I turn my last note into change

Just one debt you start my day without you here
Point to me, I'll walk away, you disappear
Seems you cut deep, yes you cut cold
I've got nothing left here anymore

But I don't care
The more I pay
The less I feel
The money comes
The money goes
It's all the same
But I don't care
The more you take
The less I feel
The paper lines
And worlds that are mine
What is this, we disappear

I want you to hold my hand and let go
I can't, I don't want to take control
Seems like you've forsaken up my mind
Crumbling to dust up my soul

But I don't care
The more I pay
The less I feel
The money comes
The money goes
It's all the same
But I don't care
The more you take
The less I feel

Wanna give you this and more
Let you know I truly adore you

The way you kiss me, you're making my knees go weak
We could be forever happy, through rain or whatever

It seems to me you'll never find another lover gold as I,

Back in them days my heart never made a sound
Now it's beating like my head's in the clouds 
Never doubt that I'ma always be down to hang around you

That burning, and amazing, unconditional side of love
That feel like forever, that always emotional

Right now, right now, in this very moment
I still love him like I love me
I love him minute, hour, up and down, round and round and over and over again
So rarely, I swear that you just don't exist
There's only one person I could find in the world make me feel like this

I'm a fool, such a fool for you

That deep, that sweet, that soft and that bad,
That fire that's over stall
That up and that down, that front, that back, baby,
I can't seem to get enough
Uh, baby, let me do it, let me do it till I'm satisfied
Oh baby, now, right now, baby, I ain't got no more pride
Sweet sugar, I surrender, I don't want no other man
Baby, you win and you ain't never got to worry
Never got to worry, you'll never be alone again

Don’t take for granted my loyalty
Don’t be so shady,
We were friends, alright?
Just moving down the line, boy
You turned on me, was it jealousy?

Now when you call me just to calm
Me by your side, don’t be surprised if I don’t run
Just to make it right.

My love, and you bathe me in devotion.
My love, you knew the answer to the question
I had a dream you were the ocean.

Exhilaration sparks and thunder is torn.
A song of paradise fills in my mind the shades of blue.

I haven’t found a love much more than a boy
And now our romance is a victory in love, for sure.

Lordy, how they could love
Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong

And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'
And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
""Has my lover Johnny man been here?""
""He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.""

Yeah, Frankie looked over the transom door
And there to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny
Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Well, Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah, she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well, but he been doin' her wrong yeah

He said,"" roll me over so careful ah
Roll me over so slow,
Oh roll me off to my left hand side,
Because your bullet hurt me so,
I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong.""

Well, they sent for Frankie's mother
Come down to Huddie's saloon
To see what's the matter with her boy
She come down, Frankie looked up at her
Here what she said:

She said, ""Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny
But I'm down on my bended knee
I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong ah'.

She said, ""I'll forgive you Frankie,
She said, I'll forgive you not, not
For killin' lovin' son Johnny,
He's the only support that I've got,
'Lord, you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.""

Well, the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell
She would be there lonely, herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a-he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, bring out the rubber tired (hearse) so long
You gotta bring out your pony and trap
Yeah, they're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
And he ain't never coming back
Well, he was her man
Oh, but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, the story ain't got no moral, Lordy
But the story ain't got no end
Well, the story only goes to show
That there ain't no damn good in men!

Once I was crazy 'bout a man; he mistreated me all the time, 
The next man I get has got to promise me to be mine, all mine! 

Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days, 
Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days; 
It seems like trouble going to follow me to my grave.

I ain't never loved but three men in my life:

For a lead role in a cage?

Waitin for you 
Til 3 o'clock in the morn 
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse. 

And explainin' to me, like I'm just some kinda fool 
I sacrifice the things I want to and do things for you 
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through 
Now you, wanna be a bond of me (ey)

And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

Thinkin' of a million ways 
To escape and be with you

I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin' bout when you would say

Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
Its just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you (oh oh)

Destiny didn't have such a simple plan (simple plan)
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define
Something so divine (so divine)
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind

I keep dreamin' 'bout you
When I'm dreamin' 'bout when you would say

Dreamin' bout you 
I keep dreamin' bout you
When I'm dreamin and waiting for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine

Each and everyday
I don't walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie 
Just to spend time alone
This lovin is a crime 
I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

Alicia Keys,"Here I am, here we are
As it will go on forever
Noise, always noise
Candles burn, lights are low
I haven't a place to go

Life in it's constant state of moving nowhere
The music is nice, floats through the air
Sounds of waves crashing everywhere
Percussive submissions, mind conditions
Writing with the left hand
Unknowing and taking the chance

Why not fly? Why not try?
This constant game I play to stay high
But all is just a state of mind
All is reality of your choice
Constant evolution, constant adaptation
Constant state of moving nowhere

Footsteps, silence is loud
Kindness is brave, wisdom is long
Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it
Searching, looking for the satisfaction
It is nowhere, it is everywhere

Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come
What are we waiting for?
Why are we so afraid of taking charge?
But it's always changing, always
In the constant state of going nowhere

We all have demons to battle, roads to walk
Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins
Candles and their steady glow
Water and its constant crash

Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone
Still strong, still here and so are we
Here we are forever
The constant state of going nowhere

The constant state of going nowhere
Constant state of going nowhere
Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere
Constant state of moving nowhere

It's like a jungle
It's like a jungle

It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the streets of New York

All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people
Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the streets of New York

Alicia Keys,"Right now I feel like a bird 
caged without a key
Ev'ryone comes to stare at me
with so much joy and reverie
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile I cry

They don't know what they're doing to me
keeping me from flying
That's why I say that I know why
the caged bird sings
Only joy comes from song

She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free
so she can fly, fly, fly
spreading her wings and her song?
Let her fly, fly, fly
the whole world to see

She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly, ooh, just let her fly
just let her fly, just let her fly
spread her wings
spread beauty, mm",Caged Bird

Of the bruises and the beauty in this moment that we're feeling

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways

Alicia Keys,"Everywhere I'm turning
Nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching
For the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow
State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulders
Gotta find the strength in me

I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman

For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters
Coming together
Say yes I will
Yes I can

I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman

When I'm breaking down
And I can't be found
And I start to get weak
Cause no one knows
Me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ooh

I am a Superwoman
Yes I am
Yes she is
Even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an S on my chest
Oh yes
I'm a Superwoman

To all the lovers who cant be together
Separated by distance and time

You were always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now?

Know I never let you down
I will never go away

I really wish that you would stay but what would we do
All the days that you've been gone I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home

No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting

And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting

Distance and time, I'll be waiting
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you

Love is like the sea
Leaves on your knees

Then takes you, takes you
Under, under

Well its cold
Cold under water
In the night time
But I dove
Dove to the bottom
To see what I find

That's when I saw a light
A glowing paradise
Thought I stay a while
Its been calling me underwater
Try, everything that I ever dream

Taking my breath away
Current got a hold on me
Sweeping me away
Wish that I could stay
Takes me to the top
Its the cycle that never stops

Told you only find it once in a lifetime
So you better hold
Hold on stronger then ever
Like its the last time

Like a ship in the night
You have found the place
You've been looking for
Like a distant shore
Don't you ever look back again

Seas is still in control
Cherish everyday
Cause never know
It can take away
The very thing you love the most

For me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in
No one would notice
Nobody noticed
Cause it's me where it began

Beautiful morning, please don't wake me from my sleep
Cause I need some comfort, to regain my sanity
I don't want to feel this crazy,
I don't want to feel this heartache
Shattered in a million pieces
I'm so broken hearted
No where left to run
No where left to go
So I hope

I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend

Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in?
And no one would notice
Nobody noticed
That it's me, where it began
And I pray for forgiveness within

I swear that everyday I feel like my mind is haunting me
I think of every little stupid mistake that is made
This time I'll have the strength to gather myself
I'm falling to pieces

And I pray for forgiveness
Look for the answer
Cause it's hard for me to pretend
Look to my mother
Call to the captain
Can't you see
This state that I'm in
Pray for forgiveness
Looking for justice
Searching for answers
Call to my mother
Pray for forgiveness
Breaking the silence

Nobody knows it, nobody noticed
That's it me
Where it began",Pray for Forgiveness [*]

Alicia Keys,"When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

In the morning from the minute that I wake up
What if I don't want to put on all that make up?
Who says I must conceal what I'm made of?
Maybe all this Maybelline is covering my self-esteem
Whose job is it to straighten out my curves?
I'm so tired of that image, that's my word
What if today I don't feel like putting heels on?
Who are you to criticize when beauty's only in the eyes
Of the beholder
So behold her

I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world
When a girl can't be herself no more
I just wanna cry, I just wanna cry for the world

Uh, uh, I'm so secure with insecurities
Why is being unique such an impurity?
Why are the numbers on the scale like a god to me?
All of these indifferences are based on our appearances
We please to be appeased
The truest pleasure is the fact that we can breathe
Think it into existence, do it, then achieve
A fairy tale reality, beauty was with a beast
I, I, I'm the image of your reflection
Ah, and you're the image of my reflection
Sing, sing, sing, why, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh?

Momma cooked us soup, daddy did the yelling
Uncle was a drunk, cousin was a felon
When he got pinched, he told them he wasn't tellin'
Auntie was a cook, her husband was a crook
Cause every job he had they be payin' him off the books
Ghetto university, knowledge is all it took
In a tenement I was listenin' to the hook
Change gon' come, the spirit of Sam Cook
When the feds comin', everybody get shook
Now we doin' life like Eddie Murphy and Martin
On the chain gang, I was singing into the coffin

If we ain't gettin' money, how we feedin' the kids?
It's a revolving door, where brothers be doin' bids
I know it sound wrong but the dope will be what it is
Survival of the fittest, this poor girl the illest
Broke parents and black cats give me heebie-geebies
Life seems hard but nothin' ever comes easy
Whatever's in the dark, can always become the light
If you ain't in a battle, how you gon' win the fight?
Gotta speak the truth when I'm up in the booth
The streets be flyin' birds but they don't be on the roof
Poverty is a pain like you pullin' a tooth
Told the streets don't let me go like I'm Bishop in Juice

Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself locked in, yourself locked in

Oh, maybe we could care a little more
So maybe we should love somebody
Instead of polishing the bombs of holy war

What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other

What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again

Who is it? Spiritual visit
Coincidence is one thing
Overwhelming immaculate timing

Everything we had is gone
Something new must come up strong now
I feel that I belong
And I trust you and I love you

Please show me a sign

Come inside, kneel
Remember what you hear
And I'll be still right here
Come inside, kneel
Remember who built your home
I built you flesh and bone

And I'm torn between halos, demons
All these words with cryptic meanings
Separate seasons
All these issues and
mixed up feelings
And I have to choose

Everything we had is gone
Something new must come up strong now
I feel that I belong
And I trust you and I love you

Please show me a sign

Come inside, kneel
Remember what you hear
And I'll be still right here
Come inside, kneel

Remember who built your home
I built you flesh and bone
Come inside, look around
I'll lift off the ground

I snapped your ribs made a lover
So you could share each other
Come inside, kneel

In motion we seem wrong
In summer we can taste the rain

I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

Two can play this game
We both want power
In winter we can taste the pain

In our short years, we come long way
To treat it bad and throw away

[Chorus]

You won't cry, I won't scream

In our short years we come long way
To treat it bad and throw away
And if we make a little space
A science fiction showcase
In our short film, a love disgrace
Dream a scene to brighten face
In our short years we come long way
To treat it bad, just to throw it away

Lass dich treiben

Alin Coen Band,"Ich reiche dich weiter, weil ich selbst an mir scheiter. 
Wünsch dir ein besseres Leben, 
Ich kanns dir nicht geben. 
Ich wollt es vermeiden, ich musste mich so entscheiden 
Deine Zukunft soll besser sein als meine. 

Es ist besser so denn ich habe keine. 
Ich habs dir geschrieben ich werde dich immer lieben. 
Mir sind die Hände gebunden noch keinen Ausweg gefunden. 

Ich bitte dich mir zu verzeihen. 
Ich wünschte es könnte anders sein, 
Du kamst viel zu früh für mich. 
Ich geb dich in andere Hände, 
Was ich hab genügt dir nicht. 
Ich bin kraftlos, 
Denn am Ende ist keiner da der uns trägt, 
Ich hab dich in ein besseres Leben gelegt",Andere H채nde
Aline,"Le soir devant ma glace, je m'entraîne
A bouger en cadence, à me rapprocher de l’arène
Je la suis à la trace mais elle me sème
Légère et arrogante
Elle glisse sans chercher à me plaire
Je voudrais l’oublier et je me sers
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je danse

C’est vrai qu’elle est infiniment belle
Je pourrais l’embrasser
La prendre et mordre dans sa chair
Tenter ma chance à tort en travers
Et passer pour un fou
Cela n’en vaudrait pas la peine
Allez, pour me venger je me sers
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je danse

Sortir avec elle, la prendre dans mes bras
Que je me donne plus qu’elle se donne
Hélas, autour de moi, il y a comme un voile
J’aimerais tant que, pour une fois
Ce qu’elle me donne elle me le donne

Dans les yeux noirs d’un garçon elle se perd
J’aurais dû essayer, ce soir je dormirai par terre
Je me plonge tout entier en arrière
Au fond du trou noir l’univers est infiniment clair
Dans les bras d’un autre homme elle se sert
Je bois et puis je danse, je ne sais pas comment
Je bois et puis je pense.

Sortir avec elle, la prendre dans mes bras
Que je me donne plus qu’elle se donne
Hélas, autour de moi, il y a comme un voile
J’aimerais tant que, pour une fois
Ce qu’elle me donne elle me le donne

Au milieu des limaces, je me traîne
Au fond, le couloir se vide et je n’ai pas finis mon verre
La cloche a sonné, je marche à l’envers
Je pars et puis je mente, je ne sais pas comment",Je Bois et Puis Je Danse
Aline,"Un monde est mort et toi tu pleures

Souviens-toi de ce soleil pâle
Du ciel couleur de corail

De toutes ces belles fumées sales

De petite fille amoureuse
Mêmpêcheraient de m'en aller

Souveins-toi de ces lumières pâles
Du bruit du train sur les rails

Ne me regardes pas, je pleure

De ces lumière de corail
Des regrets

Disparues à tout jamais",Avenue des armées

Aliotta-Haynes,"There's a road I'd like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it'll take you up or down
From rags on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin' on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain't no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And there's no peace of mind, or place you see, than riding on Lake Shore Drive

And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore drive heading into town
Just slicking on by on LSD, Friday night trouble bound

And it's Friday night and you're looking clean
Too early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you're pleasure bound
And it's four o'clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine's fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

Hear the mighty engines moan
I'll be far from here when the sun comes up
And a love that has grown ???

I hope a better day will find us soon
The love that we thought to be true

",Don't Follow Me
Alison Krauss,"I've lived a life full of sorrow
With no where to run or to hide
Happiness you'll see is borrowed
All I want is you by my side

[Chorus]
Gentle river take me away
to the time of happier days
All I need is love and company
Gentle river bring him back to me

You can spend all your time a'cryin'
Listen here I don't need your sympathy
Cause I've made my life to live it
All I need is you here with me...

[Chorus]

Gentle river bring em' back to me",Gentle River
Alison Krauss,"In your eyes, I see gentle rain
Springtime comes, in love again
Puts me back on my feet again
And in your eyes, I feel no pain

and in my mind, I saw love walk past
A lovers dream within my grasp
I never knew I could fall so fast
But in your eyes I found love at last

I found your love waiting at my door,
I found a dream come true
I've never known a love like this before
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you

I found your love waiting at my door,
I found a dream come true
I've never known a love like this before
And if you take me there, I'll be waiting for you

In your eyes, I see gentle light
It gives me hope, it gives me life
It gives me love when I hold you tight
And in your eyes I found love tonight
And in your eyes I found love tonight




",In Your Eyes
Alison Krauss,"There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights
They remind him, of nights long ago,
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley marred,
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to his knees,
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not hold

[Chorus:]
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away

And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his women's love
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger and fear

As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen leaves
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his injured pride
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not hold

[Chorus 2x]




",On the Borderline
Alison Krauss,"Could your heart ever be mine
Your arms hold me so close to you
All through the night
Your eyes gaze into mine
Saying I should believe you
I always do, I don't know why
 
Cause you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Told me you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Sleep on
 
Could your heart ever be mine
My arms hold me so close to me 
All through the night
My heart warned me this time
But I need to believe you
I do, just for tonight
 
But you taught me a lesson the hard way one time
Promised you loved me but then changed your mind
I never told no one how I hurt down inside until now
Sleep on
Sleep on",Sleep On
Alison Krauss,"I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately, it just ain't my style
And hard times don't last like they used to
They pass quicker, like when I was a child.

[Chorus:]
Somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
And the magic the morning is bringing home
A song for a life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

[Solo]

The midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they blow like a breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

[Chorus]




",Song for Life
Alison Krauss,"The big moon is risin' so bright in the sky
But it won't shine brighter than the stars in your eyes
It rises above me so bright and so blue
And I won't see anyone, as lovely as you

Take me into the night,
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you, more than I could show you
More than I could know, in my heart

So lay down beside me and hold me tonight
For your love has found me and it feels so right
These thoughts in my mind are so scattered and few
And I won't see anyone as lovely as you

Take me into the night,
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you, more than I could show you
More than I could know

Take me into the night,
Past these lonely dreams in my heart
I love you, more than I could show you
More than I could know, in my heart
In my heart



",As Lovely as You
Alison Krauss,"Out on the hills of glory land
So happy and free at God's right hand
They tell of a place of marvelous grace
On heaven's bright shore
Pilgrims on earth someday will go
To live in that home forever more
Trusting in Him who died for sin,
And rose from the grave

On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave),
In all that fair land (that wonderful land).
Not even a tear will dim the eye,
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore)

When I must cross that rolling tide,
There'll be someone on the other side
Welcoming me to that fair land, made perfect by love
When I walk up the milky white way,
I'll see that home coming in a ray
How great it must be for angels to see
A pilgrim reach home

On heaven's bright shore (on heaven's bright shore),
There's gonna be no more dyin' (over there)
Not one little grave (not one little grave),
In all that fair land (that wonderful land)
Not even a tear will dim the eye,
And no one up there will say goodbye
Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore

Just singing His praise through endless days
On Heaven's bright shore



",Heaven's Bright Shore
Alison Krauss,"I can hear those lonesome midnight sighs in your sleep
I can hear the freight train's whistle cry, it's tellin' me
It's telling me, oh darlin' can't you see
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye

Here comes goodbye, tonight
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right
It comes as no surprise, this time
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye

Better take some time to talk it over again with me
Better get all your things together now if you leave

Here comes goodbye, tonight
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right

I can see your shadow look back at me outside my door

",Here Comes Goodbye
Alison Krauss,"What a gray, cloudy mornin' I rise from my bed
And I wonder if he meant all the things that he said
Well I think of all the good times, but the bad times came along
Now it doesn't matter 'cause he's gone.

Now I'm alone again, I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left, his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still

He may not have loved me, or cared for me at all
But through all the teardrops, he sure made me fall
And when we were together, my world was in a spin
I will never love him again

Now I'm alone again, I cry in my sleep
I wonder why he left, his love I tried to keep
I don't understand him and I guess I never will
He could always make my heart stand still
Yes he could always make my heart stand still

Oh my Lord, can you hear me?
I need a place where I can rest

Oh my Lord, I can't remember

Alison Krauss,"Two highways lay before me, which one will I choose
Down one lane I'd find happiness and down the other I would lose
There is no one that I can trust, I must decide alone
My decision is an awful one, which road will take me home

In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice

Perils, there are many, as I set out on my way
If I lose your love I know that I can call it back someday
Rambler, lonely rambler, just 'cause anyplace is home
Nashville, lights how you have always shined

Wishing now that you had found a word or two to say
But the mornin' came and we both knew my eyes gave it away
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye I thought only time will tell
And you can't draw water from an empty well

In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice

Alison Krauss,"As I went now for to take a little walk,
I came upon that Wild Bill Jones
He was a'walkin' and a'talkin' by my true lover's side
And I bid him to leave her alone

He said my age is 21, too old to be controlled
I pulled my revolver from my side,
And I destroyed that poor boy's soul

He reeled and he staggered and he fell to the ground
And then he gave one dying moan
He wrapped his arms around my little girl's neck,
Sayin' â??Honey won't ya take me home?â??

So put them handcuffs on me boys,
And lead me to that freight-car gate
I have no friends or relations there,
No one for to go my bail

So pass around that ole long-neck bottle
And we'll all go on a spreeâ?¦
Today saw the last of Wild Bill Jones,
And tomorrow'll be the last of me.

Alison Krauss,"I don't need a perfect lover to hold me in the rain
Someone to ease my pain when I feel blue
If I lost you to another, think I'd drown out here for sure
Won't you stay with me and be my only cure?

Dark skies may cloud my day
But that don't bother me
As long as I can hold you close to me

I don't need a part time lover to leave me in the cold
With empty arms to hold when I need you
Tell me that there is no other, send the cold wind from my door
Give you all my love and more if you want me to

You just don't seem to hold me like you used to

I've got that old feeling, you're leaving
I'm so tired of goodbye
I can't wait on your love forever
While you change your mind

Morning finds us face to face
I feel you staring through me while I'm talking
Familiar looks I recognize the same old looks that said goodbye the last time
Something I'm used to

It's over and over and over, I'm asking why

Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through
Gone is the sweet love, tried but untrue
It's over all over now

Surrounded by daydreams
Holding that someone that's holding my heart
Thrilled with the memory
Of the smile that you gave me
Gives a close feeling
Though we're far apart

The longest highway runs between us
Though you're just a heartbeat away
When I think of you, my heart knows no difference
I've got you with me every day

If I could be anywhere
I'd truly be with you
Then once feel the embrace of your hand in mine
The longest highway
Can sure seem forever
Through every daydream
I feel closer each time

Must be something you could say to me
To keep me warm on this cold dark night
Can you bring out the best in me?

That old moon in shining brightly
Up above the midnight plains
I only want your love to guide me
Back through the night and take us home again

Can I bring out the best in you as well?
Must be some way you could let me know
While we wait out the sun, only time will tell
Will you love me or let me go?

Up above the midnight plains
I only want your love to guide me
Back through the night and take us home again

Can you tell me what is on your mind?

Alison Krauss,"If I could have the world and all it owns
A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones
If all the earth were mine to hold
With wealth my only goal

I'd spend my gold on selfish things
Without the love that Your life brings
Just a little bit more is all I'd need
Till life was torn from me

I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be
Faith can see right through the circumstance
Sees the forest in spite of the trees
Your grace provides for me

If I should walk the streets, no place to sleep
No faith in promises You keep
I'd have no way to buy my bread 
With a bottle for my bed

But if I trust the one who died for me
Who shed His blood to set me free
If I live my life to trust in You
Your grace will see me through

I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand
Though rich or poor I may be

Gets down on her knees and hugs me

And she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages and loves me
Well, I was grown to be a man
And the devil would call my name.

In the darkness as black as the sea

From here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone.

Like a king, I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world

I shall reach when the sun goeth down
When through wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand

When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.

In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When his praise like the sea billow rolls.

Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down
When I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest
Will there be any stars in my crown.

Oh, what joy it will be when his face I behold
Living gems at his feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown.

I came here to sink or swim
And to show them all that they were wrong

Who never forgets who you are

The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there to
 
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking all inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you

Lies upon the ground
And I get so lonely
Since you let me down

Well, I used to be so happy

Now there's just sadness
Everywhere I meet

Start walkin', baby, walk all over town
Sweet tears of sadness fallin' down
Keep lookin', baby, and I won't be around
Blue trail of sorrow on the ground

Now when I had a dollar
You'd stick right by me
Now I've got nothin'
But blues for company

Well, I think I'll leave tomorrow

In the time it takes to say it, the whole world has turned
If a heartbeat lasts a lifetime then I've lived before
'cause I remember standing at this open door

[Chorus]
This path is not the one I'd choose to travel
Even as we watch what tied us unravel
And the tears fall like rain
Deeper than crying, the loving still remains

Neither wants to be the one to say goodbye
And neither wants to be the one who's left to cry
But in our secret heart of hearts we both know
That the time for patching up has passed and it's time to go

[Chorus]

So I'll be the one to pull our tangled lives apart
I won't dodge the angry words that hide a broken heart
And my calm fare-thee-wells cannot obscure
That deep inside, my heart is also hurtin' so

Alison Krauss,"I used to laugh at all those songs
`bout the rambling life, the nights so long and lonely
Well, I ain't laughin' now

In all the same ambitious dreams
That only lonely life allows

And the home I don't go home to
The friends I don't see
Aren't the part of this life
That endears it to me

If that's the price I have to pay
For doing things my own way
Then it's what I'll have to do somehow

[Chorus]
Till I find my way back to my heart
For there's no one but me's gonna take my part
It's too early to say that it's over
Or to find we can make a new start
It's too early to say
Till I find my way back to my heart

I thought at least we'd meet again
Since we have been the best of friends and lovers to each other
Meet again and speak our minds
Force no issues, turn no blind eye
Toward the road that lies ahead

But it seems that I missed you
By a coast and a song
When time gets so short
""So what?"" turns to ""so long""

I cannot keep your love inside
It's a flame I cannot hide forever
In the name of hanging on

Like a haven safe from harm
Till the bitter stole the sweet
I was perfect in your arms
A precious while I had your smile
Till it all fell apart with one change of heart

The pain and regret will fade but a fact of love will still remain
You can't always trust happiness
Love like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fades
You can't always trust happiness

If a single star I see
Ever made a wish come true
It would bring you back to me
But the best my heart can do
Is to love again, I don't know when
Still it's worth all I fear, the heartaches and the tears

Love like a lesson learned when we pass the point of no return
You can't always trust happiness
There in love's steady glow hides the power to hurt us so
You can't always trust happiness",Happiness

But now I am a man
And I need a place to hide

He looked me in the eye

In favor of my expectations
Flyin' above the rest, 
Never fallin' from the nest

And now I'm in a little situation
Maybe it's for the best
I can live alone, I guess

Maybe I can stand alone
Maybe I'm strong as stone
Even though the bird has flown
Maybe he'll fly on home
 
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart

Alison Krauss,"My father was a farmer
But his head was in the sky
He worked everyday but Sunday
'Til the day he died

He prayed for rain and thunder
And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground
 
We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
Me, I used to have a hunger 
To wear a pilot's wings
 
But the circle's that I ran in
Turned my head around
And the planes I had my plans in
Never got off the ground
 
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away
Fly away
 
Don't raise your hopes
You hear so many say
The higher they get
The closer they are to flying away

Alison Krauss,"Who would sell their soul for love
Or waste one tear on compromise?
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love
 
I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love
 
Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair
 
But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",That Kind of Love
Alison Krauss,"Tell you a little story and it won't take long
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
For that young man was always well

He planted his corn in the month of June
And by July it was up to his eyes
Come September, came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost

His story, kith, had just begun
Said, ""Young man, have you hoed some corn?""
""Well, I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain
But I don't believe I raised no grain""

He went down town to his neighbor's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin', ""Pretty little miss, will you marry me?""
Little miss what do you say?""

""Why do you come for me to wed?
You, can't even make your own corn grain
Single I am and will remain
A lazy man, I won't maintain""

He turned his back and walked away
Sayin', ""Little miss, you'll rue the day
You'll rue the day that you were born
For givin' me the devil, 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn""

Alison Krauss,"Daylight falls 
And I'm lost in the big parade 
Hold my hand, darling 
I'm afraid of the daylight 
 
Shade is dark 
Cool and languid for life or long 
Safe in shadow, 
It's never as dark as the daylight 
As the daylight 
 
When I was just knee high 
My momma told me never try to be  
Someone that I am not 
Yet over time I had forgot 
A wandering child, so lost at play 
He's found himself, 
But he can't find his way 
In the daylight, oh the daylight 
Oh daylight, oh daylight 
 
Life is short 
And there's no turning back the time 
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb 
In that daylight  
 
In my mind 
There's a corner I need to turn 
Lessons left is a lesson learned 
In the daylight 
In the daylight 
 
I miss the forest shade 
That took me there 
The promise I made 
Can never leave the dark so dear 
Safe and soothing yet I fear 
As I recall and I reflect 
I see it's safer to connect 
To the daylight

Oh daylight, oh daylight

Alison Krauss,"In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God

Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry

I was always leaving

I said that's all right with me

Locked in each others arms

Alison Krauss,"I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling, West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers 'til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores

I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved

On the lake at Bistineau, she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'

Cause I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
And I would take to wider walks, so the gin I stopped a drinking
At three scores aloft this crooked frame
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved",Bonita and Bill Butler

You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away

Come the night you could be my confidant

Staring so far away
He can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching my restless days

He turns from the window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still he spares me the word goodbye
He sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
He struggles to speak but in the end I only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The words that would help me speak my troubled mind
He's offering these to me as if to be kind:
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well

A woman's silk lying on the floor
And he would keep me here if I were able
And lock us safe behind this open door

That's all I've ever been

Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
The chance, that you might have loved me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
You watched me walk away
Beside my lucky guy
To never, never know

And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said I'd be true

Alison Moyet,"Ready to embrace the day as we both break.
When the light stole in it found me wide awake.
Wasted from a sleepless night, I reach to touch your hair.

Withdraw an empty hand, for you're no longer there.
In between the silence, leaving is an empty space.
Save the ticking of a clock
Whose hands are sweeping past its face.

And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.

But as I look around me, I just feel that way for you only.
I turn my hand to something that would clear my head,
But I could not forget the parting words we shared.
I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace.

But I could not recall the contours of your face,
And, oh,
He slipped away before I had the chance to say,
""If I did something wrong, please tell me;
I'll accept the blame.""

And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.

For you only.
And I just don't want to be lonely,

Here I am,
And I want you to see, baby.

You're fighting your emotions.
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean.

Sugar never was so sweeeeet.

I'm gonna pull you deeper.
Always straying from the beaten track,
And I will be the reaper.

With petrol consumption at too high a price.
Sell us through windows at backroom board meetings;
Blindfolded and handcuffed and in single file.

On your money mile,
We are the faceless, the nameless, the homeless.
On your money mile,
There in your fortress where you couldn't care less.
On your money mile,
We are the caseless, the raceless, the hopeless.
On your money mile,
You were caught in the crossfire hauling the flag right down.

Send us to battle; send us to the frontline.
Point us at the enemy.
Lest we forget;
It's for our protection that we lay here slaughtered.
It's for our survival we bury our dead.

To reassess the situation and decide what's mine.

How could we... how could we let it get so out of hand?

Don't steal me blind.

You, my friends, would bleed me dry,
And with no hesitation you would pass me by.
And you keep telling me that you don't understand.

There's no one left to come and find you.
You're soaking wet, but the file won't dry you.
I'd like to help, but I can't stand by...

And watch you twisting the knife.
They've got you wasting your life.
Can't stop you twisting the knife.

Caress me with your anger;
Sting me with your kiss.
You've been pushing too hard.
I've been trying too long.
Now I don't believe I have the will to carry on.

Then it's two steps back.

Where hides sleep; she's avoiding me.
Don't evade me now.

This glorious love will tear us down
When nothing is left to turn around,
And giving it all is not enough
For this glorious love.

This pleasure never ought to be denied,
For this is joy personified.
You can talk to me of give and take
When I could take of you for takings sake.
But how can I deny what's on my mind,
Knowing it to be of my design?

Always thirsty like an attractive flower

Changes come as changes may.
With every fear that I allay,
I have a horror of this place.
Yet I'm accustomed to its face,
And I am safe within its maze.
But you leave me nothing in my hometown,
And now you want to pull us down.
But I can hope, and I can pray, and I will stay.
I traced my way from Bluebell Hill
To the park, and further still,
Onto the rise beyond the mounds.
And from this point I can see
My life in its entirety,
Mapped before me on the ground.
But you leave me nothing in my hometown,
And now you want to pull us down.
But I can hope, and I can pray, and I will stay.
Let the cold air bite my face,
For I am angry at this place;
Wherein nothing stays the same.
It breaks my heart to let you go,
When deep inside, us, we both know
That you will not be back again.

I have to find myself an alibi.

Why do you have to get so uptight?
There's no need to be so impolite.
Just give me back my negatives,
And I wont tell your wife about last night.

And someone's gonna hose you down
You're gonna be sorry for the way 
You whore a life around
Now tell me is he young enough
Or could it be hung up enough
Or maybe just be hung enough to keep it up

Alison Moyet,"I am running up the stairs
I can hardly breathe again
Into your arms and a perfect day
From the garden where we lay
With the roses all aflame
You called my name and I meant to say
Dorothy it's been too long, so long

I looked for your face 
watching down from the window
Wave me 'til I'm gone
I remember the dress you wore
And you're still here with me
But maybe
Dorothy it's been too long, so long

Now I'm waiting in the dark
In the strangeness of your bed
To hide my face where you lay your head
As I listen to the room
And it speaks about a distance never met
You were there and yet
Dorothy, it's been too long, so long

You left without saying goodbye
And I was so impatient then
Always one too cynical to pray
But I talk to you today
D'you hear me
Dorothy it's been too long, so long",Dorothy
Alison Moyet,"She said something like I want to go 
Down where the river's wild
He said take me then I want do drown 
Deep in your violent eyes
(feel the water rise again, 
Call the river by your name)
I want to float in through your door
Hand it on the wall, hang it all
But I want to be sure of one thing
That I'm getting into something peaceful
I want to fly in on your wing
Way way up here I don't care for anything
It's all in, and I'm not afraid I don't fear
Falling

She said listen I've been telling you 
I'm into something cruel
He said give me what got into you 
I don't care what you do
(if there's a full moon in Taiwan 
I want half of what you're on)
I want to open up your mind
Leave it all behind you and me 
We're one of a kind
We may find that we're getting 
High on something peaceful
We're gonna take it for a ride
Goin' nowhere fast but we got 
Nothin' to tie ourselves on
And I'm not afraid to go down

I""m tired of me
You've got to paint my face

Alison Moyet,"When he moves 
I watch him from behind
He turns and laughter 
Flickers in his eyes
Intent and direct when he speaks 
I watch his lips

When he drives 
I love to watch his hands
White and smooth 
Almost feminine
Almost American
I have to watch him

In his face 
Age descends on youth
Exaggeration on the truth
He caught me looking then 
But soon his eyes forgot
And everything he seems to do
Reflects just another 
Shade of blue
I saw her searching into you 
And ached a while

I watch his lips 
Caress the glass
His fingers stroke 
The stem and pass
To lift a cigarette at last
He dries his eyes
From a shadow by the stair
I watch as he weeps unaware
That I'm in awe of his despair",Ode to Boy

And all the love falls through your fingers
Another living day is lost and gone on you

One night you took me driving
You colored everyone in shades that I'd never seen
You said someone had left you
You'd tried your very best

Saying stay when leaving me
When I'm all that you need

You grew sunblind
You thought me unkind

How winter kills
Lost in daydreams
You drove too fast and got nowhere
You rode on half fare

Makes me cruel - Makes me spiteful

A heaven of rain clouds crown my day, queen of the wet ghost town brigade
Then you walk by and from my sky, nothing falls without a sparkle.
Feeling it kissing my face, so even I don't know I'm crying
Now you're him, out is in, who has time to live in sorrow
Umbrellas are chapel ceilings in chrome
And I dig the nylon blue lining your avenue
I'm not waiting on the sun like a bus that never comes
I'm at home with my colander sky
I'm just hanging with a friend
I don't need this storm to end
I'm in deep with my colander guy
It's you, you and me babe, and our colander eyes
Then you walk in, and for my sins
Nothing hurts for feeling groovy
Everything seems appealing
And even I don't know I'm lying
But we soon forget how to get on wet
We pass the towel and get back to drying
And only the time is flying
But then with only our chances slim
Back to nephrology again

I could flirt with all the guys
Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance

Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr.Right
Take cold showers every day
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal and I don't lie

It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

Almost blue
It's almost touching it will almost do

It's not the air I breathe, it's not the thing, Henry

Am I taking the wrong meaning in concluding
That the error is of your choosing
You've got to be simple
If you think that you're moving
More than the ire in me

Ah Henry, would you look at me
You cannot have it all and I will not make it easy
Henry, I'm not grateful for small mercies

Alison Moyet,"It's my song and I sing for the man in the wings
Is it strange when we never have shared anything?
I don't ache for some tender exchange in the dark
That will pass

But the purest refrain will haunt us again
And he has that with me
When I've nothing to bring
I sing for the man in the wings

We won't speak, he won't ask me to follow him on
And his name if I ever did know it is gone
Back to back I can hear his pulse racing with mine
Both in time

I'll be waiting for him before I begin each line
And he won't mind
That I've nothing to bring
When I sing for the man in the wings

And they tell me he walks alone
It is said that he is stone
Without knowing the shape of him
I am certain they are wrong
We'll meet in a different place
Me, the man and the song

I don't long for some fleeting exchange in the dark
That will pass

Alison Moyet,"Turn the light out
Suddenly your eyes are tired
Rest on the heel of your hand
Wait for the feeling to subside

And he stares and even now you want him
Even in a room this blue
Here with these words in your mouth
And that's still good enough for you
It's what you do

If all that we make here is sorrow
And all that we get we just borrow
I'll still buy, so can we try
One more time?

Nobody made us
No one dragged us kickin here
If easy was on the cards
Then someone made it disappear

And he smiles and even now you hate him
Only now he wants you to
The liberties you take
For what he won't be giving you
That's what you do

Single ways to run
Tripping over the rubble of new roads begun

Wishing only to borrow the freedoms you'd steal

I turned back as the crowd enveloped you
Scarlet finery
Oh just look at you now
Oh, just look at you now.

How is the truth so distracted,
When love sports its favors like medals
And takes well enough,
You gave to me selflessly, sinew and bone
Grown bigger than you who yet carries me home
Hair still black, and your back is steel
With your every word tasted
Oh, just look at you now
Oh, just look at you now.

I used to dance to the drum in your chest
My feet on your feet, my head at your breast
You gave me a tune and I carry it still
And I promise my darling,
That I ever will.

Oh, he can see her face

No rest tomorrow

And he spits his pain 
And he sucks in the air like ether 
And he breathes it again 
Now his chest is a mine exploding 
And the bitumen sticks 
Like the catch in his throat

And he sleeps in the dust 
On a blanket she laid out for him, here",All Signs of Life

Counting on your fingers while they're hesitating
Folded into every fibre of the bed you make
Are you sleeping somewhere?

Hidden in soft vowels and your apple kisses
Keep me with you
Sipping soft vowels from your apple kisses
Keep me with you
When the truth bends and the word misses

You jump too soon
And miss all this

But wouldn't let them stay
Gave them hope and

Took your head to town
And your body home

And you wouldn't feel
And it wasn't bad

Close the door we're letting no one near

I watched you unfurl
You held on to me

In my cups I see you watching from the edge of the bed
I'm sinking words that you never said
When I was your girl

And then today
I'll be keeping out your way
Every debt they owe I pay
They were never satisfied

Into corners sweep our rage

This can't wait until tomorrow

If you go, I wan't be in your way

Choisir le maillot d'après l'inspiration;
Je pars d'un souffle et c'est la détonation,
Détonation, une détonation.

Un baiser et je prends le large,
C'est le filon phénoménal,

Prendre l'envol en coquillage
Une évasion, c'est une évasion.

Je m'échappe dans mon coquillage, par certitude.

Sans revenir à mes points de départ,
Cherche une étoile pour un rancard.
Faire une escale dans ma constellation,
Constellation, constellation.
A l'aise dans ma bulle à carapace,
La tristesse n'a pas sa place,
Ce mal de l'air est inlassable,
Faites attention, faites attention.
Rechargée quand je sors de là
A ses cotés, on me sent là-bas,
Son regard me donne le la
Palpitation, des palpitations.
Viens m'enlacer dans tes pétales
Ma peau de nacre, ta perle dort.
J'y entre quand les anges dorment,

Quand ma coquille est au creux de la vague
Tu ne pourras pleurer qu'un milligramme,
La fée clochette est ma seule copilote,
C'est de ma bulle que l'on passe à l'action.
A l'intérieur je suis l'antidote,
Tout va se dérouler, comme nous l'avions.

Comme un avion, mais les ailes d'un oiseau.

Que des retrouvailles en gros, en détail et synchronisées

Ma vie a changée tout comme mes tatouages
En couleur, toi tu me donne des gages
Il y a des tabous, qui font des ravages
De s'aimer comme nous c'est fou
Ma vie a changée, je suis pressée, je file
Devine où, facile au domicile de mon élu, de mon amour
Qui ne passe pas son tour

Bye bye

Que des retrouvailles,des fiançailles, des ""je viens te chercher""

Impossible de me décharmer
Impossible de fermer mes volets

Alizée,"Assise sur mon tas d’autocritique,
Je me pose beaucoup trop de questions,
Cruelles mais pas uniquement esthétiques,
À qui j’adresse mes réclamations ?
Dans les reflets que renvoient les vitrines,
Je ne m’aime plus dans cette vieille version,
Non plus dans l’esprit des magazines,
Des copines

Seulement pour te plaire,
J’me rêve toute neuve et nouvelle,
Seulement pour te plaire,
J’me rêve plus grande et plus belle,
Seulement pour te plaire,
Briller à tes yeux,
Rallumer le feu,
Et toutes les lumières,
Seulement pour te plaire,
Oh oh plus belle,
Seulement pour te plaire

Si tu crois qu’un diamant ma rassure,
On a beau se mettre à genoux,
Mes doutes mon amour ont la vie dure,
Leur tordre le coup serait plus cool,
Dans les reflets que renvoient les piscines,
Je ne m’aime plus dans ces proportions,
J’peux pas m’promener en kimono sublime,
Tout la saison

Seulement pour te plaire,
J’me rêve toute neuve et nouvelle,
Seulement pour te plaire,
J’me rêve plus grande et plus belle,
Seulement pour te plaire,

Rallumer le feu,
Et toutes les lumières,
Seulement pour te plaire,
Oh oh plus belle,
Seulement pour te plaire

Mais dans tes yeux où je me devine,
Dans tes yeux où je me replay,
Rien ne me chagrine au moins for one day,
A day dream

She took him to the lake and he fell in love.
She spent one summer waking up between his arms.
She told him how good that felt, told him he was the one.

And then she went away, his calls were not returned.
He went to see her but her eyes were burning a different stare.
The focus was somewhere else.
And that feeling had somehow disappeared.

Do you remember when they both drove out of state?
Stealing kisses behind her cousins back, 
With a love so strong tell me who could wait
When it seems so right and it feels so right, man, it had to be right.
When it seems so right and it feels so right, man, it had to be right.

As I talk in circles 'round you on my bed
Can't say I blamed you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun and so far from interesting

It's a guy like me, some bad tattoos

And I cry in the ashes, I'm 3 days old

so please don't say you won't be going out today
Cause anywhere I go, won't be anything,
If your not hanging around

it's the blackest cloud,
And it opens up
When I walk outside, and I'm all alone
An empty cell, the furnace chokes,
When I walk through the door, of my broken home

Love love, kiss kiss.... blah blah blah
You're making me sick
I wish you'd just stop showing off
For the rest of us that no one wants to love.
It's hard enough trying to drink another winter all alone
Love love, kiss kiss.... blah blah blah

Well do you find you like to fall in love with people that you're never gonna meet?
It's easier then breaking up and crying in the street
Do you curse the happy couple?
Do you cringe at wedding bells?
Do you drink up all the punch while you wish 'em all to hell

[Chorus: ]

You can't escape this fatal case of melancholia
It's in your face, in every place you go it's stalking you
And there are days when we all say we feel we just can't go on
But you've felt this way all along

[Chorus: ]","Love Love, Kiss Kiss"
Alkaline Trio,"""Over and out"", she said
From a hospital bed
""For what it's worth
It doesn't hurt don't cry""
""Over and out"", he said
With a .45 to his head
""The war has taken everything from me
It's all I see""

So...

[Chorus: ]
Run for cover
As fast as you can
We're fighters, lovers, enemies, friends
And guns and knives apologize for leaving you tonight

Leaving you tonight

""Over and out"", he sighed
""Seems I've run out of time
Please tell my wife I love her more than life itself""
""Over and out"", she sang
As the telephone rang
""There's no pain, no answering, no more, no""
So

[Chorus: ]

Run for cover and you'll find us there
We'll take out the anguish, make it disappear
With hand grenades and napalm flames, I'm leaving you tonight

Let this candle burn 'til you get home
Never forget your face, never lose hope
Tonight

Run for cover as fast as you can
We're fighters, lovers, enemies, friends
And pens and knives apologize for leaving you

Run for cover and you'll find us there (over and out)
We'll take on the anger, make it disappear (over and out)
With razorblades we're softly serenading you",Over and Out
