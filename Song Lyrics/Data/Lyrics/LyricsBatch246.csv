Kevin Rudolf,"I've been high,
I've been low,
Traveled down every single road,
I felt love,
I felt pain,
But it's all just a part of the game,
And there's people out there get you down cause their cryin the blues,
Yeah,
Just cause they never done this it's got nothin to do with you,

So don't give up
Don't look down
Cause your time is gonna come around,
Don't look back you've come to far,
Baby you were born to be a star,
Woahhhh,
Woahhhh,
Woahhhh,
Yeah,

I've had doubt,
I've had faith,
But I believe,
Everyday,
I've been right,
I've been wrong,
But you'll remember me when I'm gone,
And there's people out there they just doubt what they can't see,
Yeah,
Cause there's a shining star that baby you we're born to be,

So don't give up
Don't look down
Cause your time is gonna come around,
Don't look back you've come to far,
Baby you were born to be a star,

Kevin Rudolf,"Everybody's got a story they must tell an
You got yours and I got mine
All the times you felt the pain and seen the glory
It feels good to be alive

Now I can hear the sound
Of heartbeats all around
You know there's magic in the night
When you feel all alone
Like you're so far from home
Something always turns out right

So here's to us
And all our broken dreams
That never came to pass
We're still kings and queens
Here's to all we loved
That wasn't meant to last
Here's to everyone
Who said we never had a chance
Here's to us

Monday comes around
Your world is upside down
Feeling good in the worst way
The story's just beginning
Time we did some living
I can't wait to hear you say

It's on the radio
It's everywhere we go
The music's gonna save your life
So come on clap your hands
Remember when we danced
And raise your glass tonight

So here's to us
And all our broken dreams
That never came to pass
We're still kings and queens
Here's to all we loved
That wasn't meant to last
Here's to everyone
Who said we never had a chance
Here's to us

The night feels so long
When your heart's not filled with song
And may your dreams never leave you
Even when you've lost it all

So here's to us
And all our broken dreams
That never came to pass
We're still kings and queens
Here's to all we loved
That wasn't meant to last
Here's to everyone
Who said we never had a chance
Here's to us
To all we loved
And all we lost
To everyone
Here's to us (here's to us)
To broken dreams
And kings and queens
To everyone raise your glass

To all we loved
And all we lost

To broken dreams
And kings and queens
To everyone raise your glass

When it comes to love I?ve had my doubts 
But when you walked in my heart checked out 
And like a schoolboy crush 
I knew it when we touched 
I?m already loving you too much 

Mind and body, heart and soul 
You came in and took control 
And, oh what a rush 
This is powerfull stuff 
I?m already loving you too much 

Too much, I?m already falling too fast 
Too much, It?s too late for me to turn back 
I can?t stop this love that we?ve started 

Too much, I?m already falling too fast 
Too much, It?s too late for me to turn back 
I can?t stop this love that we?ve started 

Who knows where I?ll go from here 
I?m too far gone to see it clear 
So my heart I?ll have to trust 
And hope that it?s enough 
'Cause I?m already loving you 
There?s nothing left for me to do 
I?m already loving you too much 
Already loving you too much

It ain't that hard
If you love somebody
To go that far
Well, there ain't no limit to the things you do

That's what you do
If you love somebody
And your love is true
You don't think twice about being a fool

Send me down the river with my soul on fire
The thought of you makes the weight of this
World seem a little bit lighter

Kevin Sharp,"I met her on a Monday down at the blue star
Where we all hang out
I picked her up at work Tuesday afternoon
That night we were rockin' the town
Wednesday, Thursday-- time sure flies when you're havin' a ball
A perfect match no strings attached
By Friday we'd done it all

Saturday night under the stars
Huggin' and a kissin' in the back of her car
I said ain't this the life, what could go wrong
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb

Those three little words 
Set off a chain reaction like I'd never seen
I was shakin' in my boots
When she lit the fuse I was blown to smithereens
5,4,3,2,1- it hit me like a ton of bricks
She's got a mind to cross that line
I shoulda known it would come to this

Saturday night under the stars
Huggin' and a kissin' in the back of her car
I said ain't this the life, what could go wrong
When all of a sudden she dropped the love bomb

I was keeping it loose, taking it slow
Playing it cool, but wouldn't you know

I may never buy me a big house
A Cadillac, cruising with the top down
That ain¡¯t the way I am

I judge a man by the gold on the inside
I¡¯m not fooled by the glitter on the outside
That ain¡¯t the measure of a man

It ain¡¯t how far you go
It ain¡¯t how much you make
Son, it¡¯s what you give
Not what you take
It¡¯s being strong and true
To those counting on you
It¡¯s lendin¡¯ a hand, makin¡¯ a stand
That¡¯s the measure of a man

I give an honest day¡¯s work for an honest day¡¯s pay
I¡¯ll stand behind every word I say
I¡¯ll seal a deal with a shake of a hand
If I¡¯m a few rungs short of the top of the ladder
When I meet my maker what will it matter
That ain¡¯t the measure of a man

It ain¡¯t how far you go
It ain¡¯t how much you make
Son, it¡¯s what you give
Not what you take

Kevin Sharp,"I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me",Nobody Knows

I'm proud of my history, proud of my home
But there comes a time in a young boy's life
When he feels he's got to roam
Daddy says I'm crazy, Mama thinks I'm naive
But if I don't do it now then I'll never leave

'Cause I've driven every back road in this part of the state
Ain't a girl in my graduation class that I didn't date
Tried everything on the menu down at Fiddler's Bar & Grill
I got a taste for something this town will never fill

There's a great big world out there for me to see
I might sail a boat to China, chase dreams in Tennessee
Right now the motor's running, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Drive these streets for one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ""Population 4000 Minus 1""

Gonna see the bright lights, gonna make my mark
So many things I've got to do I don't know where to starts
Play cards in Vegas, walk the beach at Malibu
Learn a few things that I never knew

There's a great big world out there for me to see
Might play for the '49ers, Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Right now the motor's running, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Drive these streets for one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ""Population 4000 Minus 1""

Now I'm stuck in New York City, staring at these walls
Thinking how the grass out here ain't that green at all
Ain't that green at all

There's a great big world out there for me to see
I might wed a farmers daughter and raise a family
Right now the clock is ticking, just a few things I gotta do
Tell my friends goodbye
Ride that subway one last time 
Change that city limit sign 
To ""Population 12 Million Minus 1""

We decided to try
Going our own ways for while
And give each other some space
But I never dreamed it would be miles
I thought she would cry
While she was packing up 
I guess something isn't wrong enough

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here 
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me
You couldn't look at her and tell
My heart's breaking and
She's sure taking it well

There go all of my dreams
Melting like sugar in the rain
I would love to believe
She's only smiling through the pain
All the tears are mine
Shouldn't she be sad
After losing everything we had

She's sure taking it well
Taking my heart and my soul
You'd think I wasn't here 
Falling apart watching her go
If she knows it's killing me

Kevin Sharp,"It's five o'clock
At the Sad Cafe
Dinner for one, a table for two
Another lonely day
She tries to hide the pain
But her strong will is just a weak disguise
It's there in her eyes

She wants to be somebody's baby
She wants to be somebody's friend
She just needs a choulder to lean on now and then
She's no stranger to danger
She's had her heart broke a time or two
She wants to be somebody's baby
But she's nobody's fool

Someone long ago
Promised her the moon
But the fairy tale didn't go so well
It ended way too soon
And the scars of love
Have been known to take some time to heal
Can't you see how she feels

She wants to be somebody's baby
She wants to be somebody's friend

I'm all right, I'm okay
And I'll live to fight for another day
'Cause I've got hope and that's enough
Until I find the strength to love

Like a weary fighter knocked off his feet
I couldn't even feel my own heart beat
But I've got faith to lift me up
Until I find the strength to love

I know down deep there's a spark
Inside this broken heart of mine
I'll be as strong as before

She's one in a million, I've heard that a million times
The odds were less that even she'd be mine
How many times does a dream come true, come into your life?
I can't believe the way she makes me feel
I have to pinch myself to know it's real

A touch so soft
A smile so sweet
She's so much like an angel, she's heavenly
She's as perfect, as anyone can be
But her heart is only human
Guess that's why she's loving me

She could have had anyone she wanted, but still she wanted me
I do my best to give her what she needs
I thank my lucky stars above that I'm the one she loves
So many men will never find their way
To what I wake up looking forward to each day

She said I'm not pointing fingers
And he said yes you are
'Cause you wouldn't bring it up if you weren't
If I told you I'd been walking
Out in the dark night thinking
Would you take as truth this alcholoics word?
I can't change what's done is done
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins
And I need you to hold on to while this part of me is dying
Though I haven't kicked the demons that haunt me
I'm trying
I'm trying

She sat down on the floor
And said I wish I was stronger
Right now I feel fragile as glass
I want to believe you
Believe what's held you has freed you
And I hate these doubts that keep on coming back
My parents think I'm crazy for staying here this long
But there's nothing more I want for us than to prove to them they're wrong
I don't want to be afraid, I don't want to think you're lying
And though I haven't found the faith yet, that I need
I'm trying

He asked, do you want me to leave?
'Cause if you do, you know I will
But she said, much to his disbelief
No, I love you still

He said I don't know why I've been the fool
But I can tell you this
Not a day goes by that I don't curse myself and all my sins

At the Praire View Motel
They've got a swimming pool shaped like the state of Texas
And a room with a view, on our honeymoon
We were learning new dances
I remember my hands were shaking
I didn't know what to do
You had to show me
And the world just seemed to stand still
In that road-side adobe
Two hearts, beating as one
Lost in the moon, found by the sun
Too soon to know for sure, but too late to run

I want to be scared like that again
Feel the wave of emotion come rushing in
My trembling lips, the taste of your kiss
The touch of our skin
I want to be loved like that all night
I want to be shocked by the morning light
Let love take us back, I want to be scared like that again

Lately we've been coasting
Living day after day
Safe and familiar
But hidden somewhere
Is that feeling we shared
When love was an adventure
So tonight let's walk to the edge
Where love is so deep it scares us to death
You catch me when I fall, and I'll catch my breath

I wrote it down when I was only
A young boy of seventeen, a long list of what true love means
Now I'm here on the wrong side of lonely
'Cause I never really knew what really matters to me

She don't have to be wild

One good bye
And the world that I knew
Just slips away
And dares me to forget it
I know my heart
Will heal one day
If memories will let it
It hurts when everything reminds me of you
So to protect myself, what else can I do?

I think of the sun
I think of the rain
I'll count the shadows on the wall, so I won't feel the pain
'Cause if I think of you
My strength will be gone
So I'll do anything at all
So tears won't fall

How I try
Never to slip
And speak your name
It would come so easy
That would just stir the fire again
That I swore was cold inside me
I almost loved you, but I stopped just in time
If I'm to save myself, you can't cross my mind

I think of the sun
I think of the rain
I'll count the shadows on the wall, so I won't feel the pain

We don't talk much, anymore
Though I'm dying to call
You say it's over, now for sure
But for me it isn't over at all
I lie awake and struggle every night
Though it's less than what it was
It's more than I can fight

It's still love and it still has awesome power inside and over me
Look inside my heart, it's still love
Even though we're not together there's a part of me
That's never gonna change, that's still burning with the flame
Even though it's not the same as it was
It's still love, to me

Throw away the book, forget about the rules, set aside your doubts
They don't apply now
Everything you know, all that's gone before
Ain't what we're about, it's here and right now
Compared to any other love, baby this is way more
Beyond the physical

This ain't your typical
Predictable
Here today and gone tomorrow fling
It's more of a magical
Mystical
Once in every lifetime thing
It may sound improbable
It ain't logical
But when love is this undeniable
It's everything and it's anything
But typical

Jealousy and pride, all that petty stuff, trips the others up
With us there's no way
We can rise above, go against the gray
We'll be strong enough to make our own way
The future that I'm seeing ain't a paint by numbers picture
It's an original

This ain't your typical
Predictable

A simple disagreement
Over something so small
That's how it always starts
It ain't no one's fault
We both had to be right
That's when it all went wrong
Making something out of nothing when we should have been holding on

We can get through this
We can ride it out

Get out of that rain

Que aún dentro de mi alma
Conservo aquel cariño
Que tuve para ti...!
Quién sabe, si supieras
Que nunca te he olvidado...!
Volviendo a tu pasado
Te acordarás de m? ..

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme;
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción;
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho;
Dec? percanta, qu? has hecho
De mi pobre corazón!

Sin embargo
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida
Que nunca olvidar?

Al cotorro abandonado
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana,
Como cuando estabas vos...
Why aquel perrito compañero
Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

My-oh me-oh 
I go wild then I have to do the samba, Then la bamba 
Now I'm not the kind of person with a passionate persuasion for dancin or romancin 
But I give in to the rhythm and my feet follow the beat of my heart 
 
When my baby, when my baby smiles at me 
I go to Rio De Janeiro 
Me salsa fellow 
When my baby smiles at me 
She shines the lanterns of my life 
And I am free at last what a blast! 
Whoa 
 
When my baby, when my baby smiles at me 
I feel like Tarzan of the jungle 
There on the hot sand 
And in the bungalow 
While monkeys play above-a 
We'll make love-a

tickle my imagination easily

Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.

I'm sure I'd make the same mistakes
That I could make it through the pains and joys and aches
I knew back then I would do it all, I'd do it all again

Before I go, I want you to know that I look back with no regrets
And when our luck was wearing thin and we were down and out
And still came back to win against all bets
Now when I look back I still have no regrets

And it's so hard to say good-byes
When there's so much that's left unspoken in your eyes
But unless I spread my wings again, I'm afraid I'll never soar
So hang on to the memories and hold me close once more

Once more, just once before I go, I want you to know
That I have loved you all along and even when we're far apart
I only need to feel you're living in my heart and I'll be strong
I'll love you just the way I've loved you all along

And it's so hard to say good-byes
When there's so much that's left unspoken in your eyes
But unless I spread my wings again I'm afraid I'll never soar
So kiss me for the last time and hold me close once more

Once more, just once before I go
I want you to know that I have loved you all along
And even when we're far apart
I only need to feel you're living in my heart and I'll be strong

You are the light that shines on me
You always were and you'll always be
So I had to let you know, just this once
Just this once before I go

And Lil' Keke 780'll do their latest out here 'n do his thang
This called ""Don't You Know""
Go on ladies you need to get wet on this one

Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so

Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'
We can play our way, at this game I'm a pro
Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated
You have cheated on your man to his spirits a g
When you know that he got flicks with a playa like me
I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'

You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
want to want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter?  Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas & benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do want to be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you want to, are you gonna?  Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

Kevin Welch,"Somebody's waiting back home in Dallas
With no idea where she has gone
Got her suitcase all packed up
In the back of the pickup
Got her red knee-high luccheses on
She's on any old two-lane
West bound she knows
'Cause she was chasing her shadow
When the sun finally rose
Man, she's just running
It don't matter where
She figures she'll know where she is when she's there

But she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She rolls down the window, turns up a song
Laughs at the weather and says, hello, I'm gone

She broke down in Lubbock
Got it stuck in reverse
So she hitched down the highway
Her little gun in her purse
Got to the station
Stared at the phone
Found herself thinkin' about calling for home

And she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She dropped in a quarter made herself strong
All that she told him was,","Hello, I'm Gone"
Kevin Welch,"All I've got is what I've got
I can't act like what I'm not
Got an old soul
A tender heart
And I came straight to you

Well I do my best to tell the truth
Ask my friends if you need proof
If you don't count my reckless youth
I came straight to you

Thought I walked a twisted trail
'Til I saw where it led me to
Yeah, one foot in front of the other baby
And I came straight to you

Had this picture in my mind
Of someone that I hoped
I'd find
Honey I've known you a long long time
And I came straight to you

Well it seemed such a long shot
But somehow my aim was true
Like a moonbeam across the water baby
I came straight to you

All I've got is what I've got
And I can't act like what I'm not
Got an old soul
And a tender heart
And I came straight to you

Thought I walked a twisted trail

Kevin Welch,"I woke up to the sound of the church bell ringing
Sunday morning rain
Dreaming of you again

Did it ever come true again
I've been thinking 'bout the miles between us now
How I got so far away from  you

Running from myself I know
Now it's such a long way home
I've been as lost as the long shot gamble we bet a dollar down

Stuck out here in the middle of nowhere
Trying to turn it all around
Get myself back on the road

Lord it's such a long way home
We use to race like a devil down a straightway
With never a worry in the  world

Chasing down a thin white line
Girl we made some real good time
Solid  road up ahead take a turn for the worse

We didn't even try to slow down
That's where we went wrong I know
Now it's such a long way home

I've been as lost as the long shot gamble we bet a dollar down
Stuck  out here in the middle of nowhere
Trying to turn it all around

Get myself back on the road
Now it's such a long way home

I woke up to the sound of the church bell ringing

Did it ever come true again
Guess there's only one way to know
It's gonna be a long way home",Long Way Home
Kevin Welch,"There used to be a main street cross the country
And that good ol' road would take you all the way
From clark and ogden street up in chicago

I was praised up somewhere in the middle
Me and my daddy watch 'em roll through town
I saw license plates from states I'd only dreamed of
They just wave goodbye and put that hammer down

[Chorus]
Well the restless and the desperate
The young ones and the old
All together like a river flowed
Lord I hope they got where they were going
All the children the mother road

The dust bowl okied stoppen in arizona
To trade their family things on gasoline
Just to find themselves outnumbered by the thousands
Who'd already traveled down that road of dreams

When the war was over all the baby booms
Loaded up there cars and they grabbed their kids
Just to count the miles and cuss those big freight liners
Across twenty two hundred miles of route 66

[Chorus]

Now the hot top is just ranch roads and runways
And a way of life for some folks is all but gone
You can almost see the ghost towns from the fast lane
Of this super highway we're rolling on

[Chorus]",The Mother Road
Kevin Welch,"I been working these bone dry fields all day
While she stays on my mind
Since she left in '86
Nothing's worked out right
She married a man with some bottom land
Moved just down the road
I hear he's afraid he's losing her
And I'm afraid we won't

[Chorus]
One man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain
That man's trying to keep her love
This man needs her back again
What we want is different
But what we need's the same
Yeah one man's praying for sunshine
One man's praying for rain

If I'd only loved her right
She never would've left
And I wouldn't be here wishing
She was leaving someone else
I don't even know the man
Or mean him any harm
All I want is what I had
Back here in my arms

[Chorus]",Praying for Rain
Kevin Welch,"Till I see you
I'll be watching
Though my vision seems so dim
I'll search the skyline every morning
Till I see you again

Till I hold you
I'll be waiting
Like a sailor waits on the wind
I'll be drifting, going nowhere
Till I hold you again

These days it seems like I'm just biding my time
I don't even try to get you off my mind
This pain in my heart
It ain't ever gonna mend
Till I see you
See you again

These days it seems like I'm just biding my time
I don't even try to get you off my mind

Kevin Welch,"The last time I thought about leaving
Was the last time I made her cry
I talked to myself out of believing
That true true love never dies

The first time I thought of returning
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a turning
And there was nothing on this earth gonna shut me down

[Chorus]
If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True love never dies

The fires of anger turn to ashes
And your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesomest night surely passes
But that ol' true true love never dies

Well I'd sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True true love never dies",True Love Never Dies
Kevin Welch,"You're afraid  of your own shadow
And I won't let you walk in mine
There's a light somewhere inside you
But you will not let it shine

I told you as your lover I told you as a friend
All I can do is show you  now
The only way I can
We've come this far and we'll go no farther

'Cause you've traded it all
For a feast of bread and water
Love is something that you make
Love is something that you give

It ain't something that you take
No that ain't no way to live
Love is something that you do
And love is what  you do  it for

Sent me on my way
I walked one mile under blue skies
Nine miles under gray
I've been up, I've been down
Suits me either way
I feel fine, I feel fine today

I have stood in the piney woods
And taught myself to pray
I have rolled the devil's dice
Any game he'd play
I have stood my ground
And I've turned and walked away
I feel fine, I feel fine today

I don't know where I'm going
Or how long I will stay
All I know worth knowing
Is I feel fine today

I built my houses tall and strong
And burned them down again
Caught every dream I've ever dreamed
And I put them in the wind
This old world, it's a tilt-a-whirl
And I love the way she spins
I feel fine, I feel fine my friends",I Feel Fine Today
Kevin Welch,"Big wheels touch down half past nine
Immigration pulls me out of line
Looked him in the eye, said man to man
I'm just kickin' back in Amsterdam

Must have been long about half past ten
Immigration finally let me in
Said taxi driver take me to the hotel grande
Kickin' back in Amsterdam

I've been pushing too hard, thinking too much
I began to wonder if I lost my touch
Right here I'm gonna make my stand
Kickin' back in Amsterdam

Coffee shops smokin' and the red lights on
Can't help feeling like I belong
Place around the corner got a badass band

Like nothing I have ever felt before
The love I have for you it walks  beside  me
Honey It don't ever need me anymore

The love I have for you it draws it's own breath
Does what it wants to with it's time
The love I have for you it scares me to death
Seems as if my hearts no longer mine

So I pray one of these days
I'm gonna steal away and somehow lose
This love I have for you
People tell me someday it'll be alright

I can finally get back  to myself
But the love I have for you won't let me sleep nights
And it won't let me love nobody else
So I pray one of these days

I'm gonna steal away and somehow lose
This love I have for you
I know to you it seems like such a strange thing
It's still with me after all this time

But there's nothing I can do that's gonna  change things

I think that I'm going crazy
Gotta tell myself man it ain't that big a deal
It's better than pushing up daisies
I slip and stumble and roll down the hill
Trying to impress the ladies
Once played the fool I guess I always will
It's better than pushing up daisies

I walk a high wire with no safety net
God only knows what saves me
All that I know is it ain't over yet
Not till I'm pushing up daisies
I've seen the arrows of death little quiver
Come so close they actually grazed me
I've seen the blood and I've felt the cold shiver
Still I ain't pushing up daisies
Standing here leaning on my windowsill
Dreaming of a sky so blue
Pushing up daisies out there on the hill
It's the last thing that I'll ever do

Sometimes my heart is as true as a child
Sometimes my heart it betrays me
Breaks right in two every once in a while

And I always knew one of these days
The stakes in this game would be raised

What else can I do but keep wishing for you
Gold ain't so precious diamonds don't shine
And a mountain top ain't so tall
Life's just a way passing some time
Love's just a place where you fall
And nothing else matters at all
I'm wishing for you I'm wishing for you
What else can I do but keep wishing for you
Well if my wishes were horses honey my horse could run
Faster and farther than most anyone's
If only you hadn't just up and gone
And left me here wishing for you

Now you may never know what I had on the line
But I hope if someday you do
You'll be held in some arms just as gentle as mine

And a road beneath my wheels,

In the road beneath my wheels,

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",24/7

Kevyn Lettau,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

And if you knew about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on
You wouldn't have played me

So you could get a dose of how I feel
'Cause our hearts can never seem to break even
But what's the use I'd rather pack it up and leave it
'Cause here we are again, 'cause you're wrong again
Quit tryin' to tell me that you love me

Half as good as me, let me show
You know what I mean, cause I'm the real thing and I got to have you

I'm falling,
I thought this boy was just a friend, I need my baby here
Cause can't nobody love me like he can

And now it's late now no talk, convos on the phone getting sparked
I'm about to jump in my car, and come and see you
No holding back I miss you, I'm letting go tonight

Everything you do, got me crazy over you ,
I can't stand the fact, that she is always on your back so
What's up
What you going do, 'cause I'm really feeling you, oh yeah

Can I talk to you
For a minute

That I wanna say

Oh reality is, taking control of me cause I know, baby
I know that your not with me

I wanna contradict my word
I belong with you, I do truly want to know (want to know)

When you hear me talking, what you think
When you looking into my eyes, what you see
I know you ain't trying to be my man
What you think about us being friends, making plans
To be everything we want to be, making our dreams turn reality
I'm digging everything you appear to be
And I'm wondering if we could be real good good friends

So emotional, you know I am
That's why you do me the way you do me, if you'd be cool with me
You'll see, that I'm all you need and all that you dream
And never would leave, you'll be by my side forever
Swear to God we'll grow old together, then reality would be you and me

When you hear me talking, what you think
When you looking into my eyes, what you see
I know you ain't trying to be my man
What you think about us being friends, making plans
To be everything we want to be, making our dreams turn reality
I'm digging everything you appear to be
And I'm wondering if we could be real good good friends

If we could be friends, baby
It be all I need, baby
I'll give you what ever you want and never would leave you a front
And be what you need, baby
Be all I have, baby
And I'd be there for you, and never would front do wat you do

When you hear me talking, what you think
When you looking into my eyes, what you see
I know you ain't trying to be my man

Fuck them niggas who try
Don't ever worry about my loyalty
Tried the others and i'm cool
'Cause you treat me like i'm royalty
Been through the bullshit 
Been through the games
Been through the telephone arguments
With nothin ass games
All them crazy days you helped me maintain
Sometimes i think your love be keeping me sane
Never worry, daddy
I never goin' nowhere
Whatever happens, best believe
I'ma stay right here, yea
I need your kisses and i need your touch
Don't ever think i've had it all

I am tired of the bullshit competin' with these other chicks
You don't know what to do with this you act like
Guess What nigga I am leaving you and guess what
I am needin' my keys from you
I was so stupid for love
Thinkin' you was everything a real man can give me and more
But guess not nigga
I'm leavin' you and guess what I'm needin' my keys from you.
I was so stupid for love thinking you was everything
A real man can give me and more but guess not nigga I'm leavin' you
And guess what I'm needing my key's from you.

Nigga hears he photo I gotcha comin' up out her front door
Thought you had me fast but damn you didn't know.
Every time you paged her she would page me and tell me you were there.
And that's a no no I let you go for months thinkin' so wonderin' why you haven't hit this
In so long I'm a smart bitch and I gave you the rope and now your hangin' there.
Tell me what in the hell your thinkin' not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh
I let you get away with this nonsense for to long ain't gone be no more callin' this yours

Now you wanna conversate sit back talkin' about the mistakes you made
When I was on your plate Nigga now hold yo wait now wasn't you the one sayin'
I guess its safe to say now every man you meet now has a tendency to cheat shame on me
Because if you new it was the same hold you to everything you thought she would be stay off me.
Tell me what in the hell your thinkin' not Keysh being home alone another weekend not Keysh

And its your loss now and it ain't nothing you know me

I'ma give you your key's back just give me my platinum and black cards
And I can't lie I'ma miss pulling your and hitting it from the back hard uh guess what

But at the end of the day ask me if I give a less fuck.

That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me
That you've changed your ways I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy

Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, should have done it
Should have given away all my love

Rollin with my window dropped
Wind blowing, about 6 o clock
Then this feeling came over me, got to find myself a pretty young thing
So I took a left on the next block, saw this shorty so I had to stop
Girl was looking as fine as could be yeah
I said do you want to ride with me

[Verse 2]
Your car is looking real smooth, and you looking kind of cute too
But boy I don't even know you, where the hell you think we going to?
Girlfriend had a little spark, so I parked the car and just walked
I don't mean no disrespect love, I'm just trying to see what you're made of

Superstar, like the cover of a magazine
No matter what you do, you'll always be my superstar

Baby boy is into me now, it's time you let me break it down
I just reminisced on how we met, and this is something I would never forget
From the moment your lips said hi, it's like I pictured your name in lights
I bought tickets to all your shows, and I'm going to be there sitting in the front row

I already heard your side of the story, hear mine
I'ma tell you why, cause you changed, (baby you changed)
When you got dough (you got dough and changed), 
Nah nah nah nah nah,no you listen, (what was I to do)

I remember like yesterday,the very day I met you
You were looking fly, I was acting shy,
So when you walked on by I ignored you
But then you turned around and asked my name
And in an instant my attitude changed,
Swept me off my feet,you were so sweet
Full of comedy, you amused me
Gave you my number, next day you called
Asking if you could see me
So I said alright, you can stop on by
It gave me butterflies,
30 minutes, knock, knock its you
I'm glad to see you, but I keep my cool
From day one I fell in love with you,
But now I ask myself who are you
Because

You've changed, you've changed
You got dough and changed (and I don't)
You got dough and changed (baby you changed)
It wasn't the same, you got dough and changed
You got dough and you changed
What was I to do

You were never there, why should I be there
There's no one there to hold me
I'm young at heart and age and these are the days,
When a girl like me needs loving
If hes not then someone else is
Getting what he calls his
Wasn't taking care of home, left me there alone
So whats a girl to do when she's feeling in the mood
We were together but we grew apart
Thinking with my mind and not my heart
Packed up all my things, left the engagement ring
Cause from the looks of things, I cant do this
Live this life that I call my life
If this is what its like being your wife,
I'd rather be a friend than through the thick and thin, 
But now is the end of my suffering

[Chorus]

What was I to do? sit around and wait for you to call
When I wanted to be in your arms
Missing you every minute you were gone
You were gone too long
Doing who knows what, who knows where
You act like you didn't care,
When I told you, I wouldn't be here
Cause you changed

[Chorus]

No it ain't about the cars, with the rims or the rings
No it ain't about the lies, or the houses, and things
Perpatratin' with the clothes, broking promises please,
No it ain't about the life that you giving to me

No it ain't about it, no it ain't about it [Repeat: x2]",You've Changed

F*** that light s***
I nodge out tha garage double pipe s***
On Rodeo like, hey, yo, ma, I know you likes dis, ha?

Capital S, capital H, capital Y, capital N, capital E
What y'all kno about G fours, SL's wit automatic doors?
Flow sick, no s***, row six, head crack
Walk tha street wit my chain out the frontin'
F*** y'all n****s walkin' 'round like y'all sayin' somethin'

I changed my mind
I don't love you
I don't love you no more
Don't waste my time
I don't love you

Stop

Watchu thinkin' when you see me
On the corner an' you see me hangin' out
Wit tha n****s on tha block
What's it all about?

And stop

Watchu thinkin' when you see me
Comin' through and you see me
Wit tha n****s from tha corner
Comin' through?

That you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me

Why you tripping?

I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club

You know you wasn't raised like that
You need to hit a club or something
You going out, Keyshia

So while you going out having your fun, I should sit here waiting for you
All this time I've invested in you baby,
Now you kicking yo dubs and making yo runs and popping yo drank and having your fun
But see its OK, cause what goes around comes around and its always been that way

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy
She cant love you like I do
Didn't I tell ya boy
Didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you
Didn't I tell ya boy

So now the sun coming at ya won't change, but I ain't sitting out there crying and shit
So while you rolling out doing yo thing, I be popping my bottles,
Rolling on dubs, hanging with my girls, I be having my fun
Cause I don't deserve all the games you play
Now you coming back this way

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy
She cant love you like I do

You going out knowing everybody's watching (hey player)
But she could never be me and ya know it baby (she got the game)
The proof is in the putting ain't no way to hide it
Didn't I tell ya boy (I know she told you)

You think you got her stuck you must be smoking
She got a lot of money too she ain't no joke man
We raised her good she got the game before the fame
You should call, ain't nothing changed you know her name
See her riding something clean looking hella fly
I know you first should change your mind I'm bout to tell ya why
She ain't staying at the house she goin out
To some exclusive shit, that you don't know about
Knew she wouldn't be curled up, crying with a broke heart
She bout to get chased and go hard
And if you wanna run the streets, chasing hoes dude
She'll be out chilling cause you ain't doing what you suppose to

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy

And I am wondering why were not getting along
So frustrated cause what we had was a happy home
I don't know what the situation is
But I could tell in the way we kiss
We don't talk no more it feels better when I'm alone

Sometimes I feel like there's no getting through to you
Like you don't appreciate all that I do
You gotta show me that you want me to stay
Don't turn and walk away?

Baby I'm slowly falling out of love with you
I don't know what to do
How did we end up here this way what are we gonna do
I'm slowly falling out baby I'm tripping on silly things
Boy, I need you to meet me half way if you want me to be with you

I remember when I be with my friends you checked on me and made time to call
But now things have changed

Keyshia Cole,"Just to think about it,
I would do things that I would regret (trying to get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again but I
Didn't know my love wouldn't grow, I should of just let it go
But I, stayed around thinking you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

Couldn't do without it, I felt I needed you in my world (to get me by, by)
More and more I looked out for you, you tried to play me like a fool so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
Couldn't stay around, thinking you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

And now I'm gone, plus I'd rather be alone
We both grown, lower your tone over the phone, alright
I should of known, damn I should of known
This wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, alright
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life
You wrong I'm right, and I'm glad I let you go

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should of let you go
Should of let you go
I should of let you go
You know I should of let you go

Don't know why you would ever lie to me so,
But I should of let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could of, should of, let you
Don't know why would ever lie to me so,
But I should of let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could of, should of, let you
Don't know why you would ever lie to me so,

Something always tells me no
And just when I think it's working
You tell me that it can't be so
Everything we worked so hard for
Should we let it go
It so unfair to be without
Trying to work it out

And there's someone else you've been seeing
I ain't up for no no

It's so obvious
She's been taking my place
From the time that you've been gone

It means so much when it comes to us

But I let a dawg roam now he wanna come home
But I don't trust him, though I still love him
No longer wonder lookin' at his cousin

From the start to the end we don't need to pretend
That we're perfect all the time

This is us, this is us and this is how we love
Some ways we're different but together we're so right
This is us, this is us and this is how we love, oh yeah

And even if we fall apart we'll never feel alone
Just like the moon starts risin' our hearts bring us home
We can always find each other like the northern star
Doesn't matter where we are our love can't go that far

Thank you lord (singing mama I thank you)
I thank you (come on),

And only you and I know, how much I've grown
Everyday I thank you father, more and more
For never turning your back on me, when things got cold
And that's why I wrote this song for you, just to let you know

That you are my strength, you are my life

Afraid from the past
But I'm done with playing games, done with doing me
Done with the same old same,
I'm giving my all
This time I won't let you pass me by
So baby, if you feel the same that I do,
And ashamed to let you know

Know what I'm a gonna do

I can't do you I can only do me

Lay awake at night 
Hold my pillow tight

At first I couldn't see me 
Fall in deep in love again
I'd rather give it all 
Than let my heart get broke again, again
Used to fall to my knees 
And ask Lord please tell me what do I do?
I know this love's untrue 
I'm heart-broken 
And trustin' nobody

So many things he does for me
Such a provider he cares for me
Wish I could give him all of me
But I can't, can't let you go
I tried hating you, but I just love you more
Compared him to you, but he can't match your score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you.

If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing's working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he can save the world that will never be enough
'Cause I choose you

And if it ain't you

Won’t stop until you will want to propose, oh
Rush into forever, let’s go
It’s only right, boy
You wanna get a kiss to me, right now
The one to win your heart into the crib boy
We got something special, like no

In the morning right before I let you get up
I love you down and make you where is hard to get up
From my lips won’t miss a spot, then work your way up
Lift my hands and feet up

Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees, believer
Boy I'ma leave ya
Praying that this night will never end, believer
Make a believer
Tonight your faith is going deeper
As your knees get weaker
I'ma have you shoutin' out

I believe
I believe
I believe

Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees, believer
Boy I'ma leave ya
Praying that this night will never end, believer

Keyshia Cole,"911, what's your emergency?

You took her around the corner by the condo
I know which hotel
Even took her round the corner by her favorite bar
Pulled up an did it in the back seat
She said you know her family well
Her sister and her brother, even her mother too
Even been giving her money for a few years
I feel so faint now
Don't know what I'm doin'
On my way to you in the heat of passion

Somebody better call the police
'Cause I'm feeling kinda crazy right now
It hurts, and I can't do much about it
'Cause I ain't catching no cases
And baby I ain't doing no time, for you
In the heat of passion
Somebody better call the paramedics
'Cause I'm feeling kinda crazy right now
And I can't do much about it
'Cause I ain't catching no cases
And I ain't doing no time, for you
My life's in a whirlwind

But instead I decided to move all my things out the house
So by the time you make it home all my shit'll be gone
Now you callin' me a million times, but I ain't pickin' up
You come in the house, everything is strolled all about
You know it's rainin', and the TV ain't workin'
You grab the bottle and the gun
And you sit down on the floor all alone
But it's too late, in the heat of passion

Somebody better call the police
'Cause I'm feeling kinda crazy right now
I can't do much about it
'Cause I ain't catching no cases
And baby I ain't doing no time, for you
Not even in the heat of passion
Somebody better call the paramedics
'Cause I'm feeling kinda crazy right now
can't do much about it
And I can't do much about it
'Cause I ain't catching no cases
And I ain't doing no time, for you (no, time for you)
My life's in a whirlwind

Oh baby, why did you do it anyway?
Don't I give you everything you need?
I cook and I clean
take care of our baby
All that over some funk ass pussy
You gotta be kidding me
you have to be kidding me
Are you serious right now
Well you need to think about it
Call your mama
maybe she can help you out this time

Can tell that we about to beat

Text message saying “What’s up?”
And now what’s up, man tryna fuck

But yet I’m still missing you

What I really wanna do, to you (want it)
But I can’t help, I protect my heart (want it)

They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Keziah Jones,"We've been conditioned
To believe what we said life.
No wonder we don't know
The meaning of ""I.""
It means the meaning of you
And the things you do,
Not the clothes you wear,
Or the talk we share.
And, now, pictures that lie
Tell us what to buy,
But never what to do.
When all your money's through.
So don't be deceived
By what your T.V. receives,
'Cause they'll pasteurize you cold,
And they'll advertise you sold.
[Chorus]
Lose all time;
Love your mind,
And free your soul.
Innoncent child turned out wild.
No more six... six picking up stix.
This kinda blufunk will make you
Trip, dip, shake your hip,
And put on the Jones train to freedom.
Now, I've been meaning to draw
Some kinda conclusion;
About the time, the mind,
And the soul intrusion.
But the Keziah Jones train of thought
Has had to be ""derailed"" and ""defracked.""
Do to this groove found
Lying across the tracks.
[Chorus x 2]
Yeah, babe,
I've been meaning to draw...
I've been meaning to draw
Some kinda conclusion,
But we've been derailed;
Derailed and defracked.
Derailed and defracked.
Does anybody know what defracked means?
If you do...
If you do,
Get on the train.
Get on the train.
Get on the train.
Get on the train.

In a crimson cellar;
Just another frinigro interstellar.
I'm flying through time,

Defyin' all the rules of race.
Flyin' through outer space.
Kissin' underneath for ma baby.
Pushing color in your face.
The ocean, itself,
Is not very far away.

When we try to take it home with us.
Take a lick of this, baby,
Every single day,
And you'll soon realise
Why we always take a bass with us.
It's for keepin' all the fools at bay.
No matter what the preacher say,
Religion is the blues in ""G"" major.
But they never let the negro play it,
So I'm flying through outer space,
Defyin' all the rules of race,

Love you when you're only on the radio
But you maybe think you know better
Well so does every musician I've ever known
Cuz every woman has a lover
Who'll risk his life to save his best guitar

Keziah Jones,"The wind is so strong
It'll blow your conscience away
I think I'll tie myself up in a neat boat
And quietly cease to exist
Because the psychological warfare
That's going on in our midst
Will put the ethics police
On your ass
So you better not try to resist
The wind is so strong
It'll blow your conscience away
The wind is so strong
It'll blow your conscience away

Fate - Destiny's fire
Love - I'll take you higher

The riptide greets the water's edge, he says it's good to meet again
The sun is out, it protects us, it lets the fish in my belly swim
Five thousand years ago, we danced with the comets from outer space
It was our nature them, indigenous, and now I feel out of place

(No mercy, no mercy) 
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
(No mercy, no mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And then man came, we welcomed him with plants and food to eat
Tranquil rivers and tall pines for shade now all but obsolete
Brother dear would beautify the woods amongst us all
And now he runs and hides from the hunter
To keep his head from the hunter's wall

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's in our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), aaaahh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

The gravitational pull
Can never be wrong
But to live all as one
Has taken too long
Mother Earth
And deservedly so
Has given birth to us all
And there's nothing to glow

But greed and corruption, violence, pollution
Hate, a disease, a new constitution
We need to gather 'round a global huddle
Give praise to the ones that we lost in the struggle
And spread the love, yo, spread the love
Spread the love, spread the love, spread the love

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), oooooh (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

And now the skies are covered up
From a blue to a shade of gray
A man in red many moons ago
Had a vision it would come someday
Five thousand years ago, the earth we now deny
Was the greatest canvas ever painted
Under the eastern sky

(No mercy, no mercy)
For the goods that grace us all, we destroy what's at our path
Aaaahh (No mercy), true (No mercy)
Understanding of the purpose of the nature of the world

Khallice,"We've been climbing up the highest mountain.
We all know that someday
We will reach up there.
We won't give up our dreams, for nothing. 

We'll just stop when we get there, on the top!
Cause you know, how much we have suffered, 
To be right here it took us
So much pain and faith to give up now 

This dream won't fade way,
While the sun is falling
We'll build our road, before the sunset!
When the journey finally gets to the end,

All the light of the father will fall upon us
Because our faith, will derogate the dark
When we're gonna be rocking
As we sing our song

Listen we must not fear the evil
But don't underestimate the power he hides
Just walk with care and always be aware!",The Journey
Khallice,"Loneliness has found a home in me
Happiness has been no friend to me
And now the sound of silence is louder than everything
I cannot take it anymore!

Wanting to break the wall
Which never gave me a reason to be there
There's nothing I can do about it
I've been trying to find the meaning
But I'm afraid to lose myself
I don't know who I should call I'm losing my mind
Maybe if I set myself free
From this world who's punishing me
Bleeding me, killing me, I'll be alright!

God! I'm bleeding, and now!
I see you, help me! I'm asking, please god!
Don't leave me, save me!
Or I'll fall, please god!!!

Loneliness has gone away
And happiness is my new best friend
I learned from the silence how to fly
Take a look around, it's easier now 'cause I found a reason
I learned from the darkness how my feelings have changed
Love can save me, love can save the world!",Loneliness
Khan,"Looking at the ground
I'm crying for the sky
I know I can't hope to go
Where I can't be found
But when I close my eyes
I start to fly

The sun burns down on me
I'm praying he'll take me away
So very much higher
Than the peaks above me
I open myself, my spirit is free

And I start to fly

As a lead upon the breeze
Higher than the chains of mortal man
Surrounded by the wonders of a life I saw but never knew
Revealed the hazy secrets of the mountain man
But soon as I am here I have to go",Mixed Up Man of the Mountains

My lips begin to burn and my heart beats faster than the normal pace
I try to resist that familiar smile, it melts me just like wax
But what's the use, I'm yours and that means forever, there's no turning back
Baby, baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never been so sure, what am I gonna do?

I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again
Baby, baby, I'm out on a limb, I'm giving in to you again

Sweeter than the taste of a midnight rendevous, so sensual
The look upon your face when you love me tender and my cup was full
Softer than the sigh when it all was over and I slumbered deep
Lost inside your love like there's no tomorrow as I fall back to sleep

Baby, baby, it's a mystery, ooh you got me spinning around
What have you done to me?
Suspended animation, I'm lost inside of you
I feel so insecure and yet I've never felt so sure

I've been living on your memory
In a world where we were one
And you told me you could make it on your own

I'm watching you tonight
And it's making me cry
When I lost you, I lost everything
But our love should never die
Not mine, my love is born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But the moment when I see me in your eyes
You're gone, you're gone

You can say goodbye if you want to
I love you but I'll try to understand
But in my soul I know it's meant to be
Together you and me

But I know you came to fade away
Like voices in the wind
And I wonder if you feel my love
It's stronger than it's ever been

I'm watching you tonight
And there's no other one
All the love we gave eternally
Now it's dying in the sun
Not mine, my love was born to be your love
Oh baby
To make history near you
But that moment when I see me in your eyes

Classe es-pèce tout op-tion di-rec-tion l'a-vion
Mar-seille Hong-Kong al-lée sim-ple bil-let bas-ta
Les mains vides votre carte de crédit dans mon porte-feuille
Champagne, hôtels c'est sexy, gros fauteuils
Digestion terminée building en vue, atterrissage risqué
Taxi pour le Sheraton sur Kaolo
Traîner dans le centre et faire des affaires, restos bien choisis
Star Féry tracé sur mon shaï à minuit
Mon rêve commence toujours ici, se poursuit toujours à Manille
La compagnie me remercie de l'avoir choisie
Je rien, j'suis plein aux as j'peux m'permettre c'est rien pour moi
J'ai toujours rêvé de faire six pays en un mois comme
James Bond, partout dans le monde où ça me chante
My name is Bond, Def Bond et je suis large quand j'invente

2. Eh Manille j'avais pas un franc la première fois
Fat Flouz, ce soir je dors au Midtown Manila
Tu sais bien juste entre Rocksass boulevard et les bars
Discothèque topless de la rue Del Pilar
Des soirées qui glissent, des plages lisses à l'humide en ville
Du ciel de plomb sur un volcan aux îles par mille
Mais laisse-les sans regret, quand je veux je reviens
Garde ma villa sur mon île je m'en vais demain
Retrouver les boîtes de nuit perchées de Singapour

RAP en France on est lourd
Funky séjour, le luxe à tous les coins de rue
Architecture pointue, la grande classe tout confondu
Nuit de rêve dans ma suite au dernier donnant sur la baie
Dîner, légère brise au balcon, Lion éclairé
Tôt le lendemain matin et pas d'avion cette fois
Ce que tu vois d'un bateau tant mieux si ça s'achète pas
Mer d'huile et ciel rangé, soleil couché dans le fond
Passer la nuit sous la lune d'équateur, allongé sur le pont
Pour la Thaïlande, Island
Jet ski, jacousi, plages et massages (body body)
Oh la belle, la vraie vie, je flambe je me refuse rien
Après tout y' a pas d'mal à se faire du bien
Comme Jams Bond, partout dans le monde où ça me chante
My name is Bond, Def Bond et je suis large quand j'invente

Ici je bloque pas ou je risquerais de rester
Le corps en vrac à bronzer croquer de l'ananas en short
Il pleut en France, le foid, j'ai oui dire qu' c' est la crise peu importe
Mon porte-feuille se porte bien, porte le transat que je larve
J'ai faim, riz fri, poissons, beignets bananes
Cari poulet piment, grillades, mariages et baignades
Plonger dans le lagon, tremper sous les cascades
Tour de l'île en offstar poste à fond sièges
Le soir avec mes amis on part pêcher
Je suis un mec simple mais j'ai des rêves de luxe
Dépenses superflues, mains croisées derrière la nuque
C'est pas le grand train que je souhaite mener
Juste du bien-être en abondance comme zéro zéro sept, espion en place

And thanking him for all the blessings
All the things that he taught me
Dealing with the problems and the worries in life
And the joys remember me
I done shined on you twice

The one you thought wasn't gon be shit
But a little whore
With your man be creepin

We take a walk through the park, scrapin, doin our thang
I'm lovin him he's lovin me, together chillin and thangs
He sayin 'fuck dem otha hoes' my diamond gleamin and blingin
We goin out lookin good together, runnin the club
And leave together, hit the leather, suckin, fuckin, an stuff
He makin sure we livin straight, I'm havin children no game
We takin trips and vacations like the brady's an thangs
He rubbin me, massagin me, wit lotion twitchin my thang
Until its wet, I got his back on me, I'm sure you can bet
Oh me oh nuthin he's never leavin me no matta the fame
That we go through it's me and you forever you'll be my man
When I meet my king it will be a beautiful thing
Touch it so will be my ho forever, his is the same

Verse 2:
When I meet my king his hair will blow in the wind
Showin me his pride, his strength, the tone of his skin
To be so pure, so deep, the lion within
There to protect me if, whenever, I'm scared
Tellin me to smile, don't cry, to hold up my head
Keep ev'thang tight, make sure, the children stay fed
Can't hold shit down if I'm gonna have a bitch in my bed
Hand femur, always dreamer, kill a nigga bout head
Shoulders tight, be the line, don't put up wit um, take shit
Know how to treat me like a queen, take me out, buy me things
My baby high in the Benz, spendin money on me
And unfound, gives a damn bout the shit in the street
Most spared, color gata, show me off to the hata
Pro-playa, shot calla, magnificent balla
When I meet my king it will be a beautiful thing
Touch it so will be my ho forever, his is the same

I got your love it went away in a manger
I got your love from sifting through bins
I got your love and amongst other things
I got your love cooking me dinners
I got your love writing me letters
I got your love that I won't try a move
I got your love and the bruises to prove

I got your love and a parking ticket
I got your love and all the shit that goes with it
I got your love from under a bus
I got your love that I know I can trust
I got his jeans I put 'em on by mistake
I got herpes off of one of my mates
I got a good thing recommended by friends
I got your love made it mine in the end",Your Love

Holla at me any time you need me

Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothing
If you ever need me - just holla at ya kinfolk

Kinfolk, look
Kinfolk she came down South with me, suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost everything she had (that she did)

To get me back on my feet she borrowed from her mom and dad
She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings man to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our s*** straight

My gal trill and for me she'll do whatever it takes
She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and Hydro
At TSU homecoming at the ma** co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, trying to come up on these figures

I'm a keep it trill man, she realer than most of y'all n****z
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)
That's how we live everyday where I'm from bra

See you my inspiration; on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you, I know they get so aggravating

Yet you got so much patience dealing with me and this dream I'm chasing
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like living out hotels and messing up your credit (credit)

It would of broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)
Get the best of ya that's why I mess with you
Went through God's test with you, why I'm so blessed with you
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest (trillest)

Compared to any other gal yeah you the realest (the realest)

Put your stunna-put your stunna-put your stunna frames on

Put your stunna frames on, so you can see what I'm saying
I got that ice on my teeth, you can see what I'm saying
I'm saying - kinfolk, they call me Kinfolk Jones
I feel so fly up in my frames, I done came up with a song
I got them D.G., Louis V, Armani and the Gucci jones
Oh forgot the sticker on your lens? Naw, that's a super stone
Kinfolk, kinfolk, you know the Memphis boys crazy
(Why you wearing shades at night?) Respect my fresh and stop hating

Check it, Polo horses on my shirt, Chanel's on my face
Red monkeys on my ass, on my feet Bathing Apes
Bathing Apes? Y'all gonna respect my fresh
I'm a fly Memphis hustler, you shouldn't expect nothing less
See my shirt match my car match my shoes match my lens
Damn kinfolk! You done merked them folks again
Again when it come to clothes man I be killing it
Trill talk, my frame game is ridiculous

Cause my future so bright I got to wear shades
And my eyes probably red from the kush and the haze

I get buck with my shades on number buck with my shades on
Walk like a pimp and grab my nuts with my shades on
Cartier, Valentino, even B&G's
When it come to stunna shades niggas ain't seeing me

And nothing they can do about it, give my tapes away for free

Was denkst du, wer du bist? Platzt einfach in mein Leben
Nur weil du ein bisschen rappst, denkst du, du kannst alles regeln
Verpiss dich! Hab Respekt, Mann, vergiss nicht
Ich hab' dir geschworen, ich scheiß' auf das Blitzlicht
Und dass ich zurückkomme und jeden von euch mitnehm'
Zehn Jahre später, wir sind keine siebzehn
Kianush, was denkst du? Das Leben ist kein Trickfilm
Du hast deine Hoffnung verloren
Betäubst dich mit Drogen und kommst nicht nach vorn
Gammelst in der Bude wie ein Junkie
Was, wenn dein Vater dich in so einem Zustand hier ansieht?
Du darfst keine Zeit mehr verlieren
In den letzten Jahren ist verdammt viel Scheiße passiert
Meine Frau hat sich scheiden lassen
Mein Sohn ist alles, was ich noch habe, und er ist grad mal in der zweiten Klasse
Er ist zu jung, um solche Dinge zu verstehen
Aber was du da machst, ist Kriminalität
Sag mir soll sein Vater im Gefängnis absitzen?
Irgendwann kommst du raus und er kennt dich kein bisschen
Nein, ich will diese Scheiße nicht hören
Ich lass' nicht zu, dass du dich selber zerstörst
Was denn? Ich schwör's dir, ich werd' dich hier rausholen
Geh von hier weg, Mann, und steig in dein Auto
Los, nimm dein Geld mit, ich will das nicht haben
Ich komm' auch gut klar ohne lilane Farben
Wieso spielst du hier plötzlich den Helden?
Wir beide leben in zwei verschiedenen Welten

Du hast vergessen, du hast selber gesagt
„Wenn wir groß sind, holen wir uns den Plattenvertrag!""

Warum? Weil du mir damals nicht mehr gefolgt bist

Scheiß auf die ganzen Knarren und auf das Kokain
Scheiß auf das Cash, das du dadurch erzielst
Die meisten siehst du heute hinterm Bahnhof am knien!""

Kommst hier her und machst ein' auf Robin Hood
Siehst aber so aus, als lebst du in Hollywood
Ha, red nicht mehr!
Den einzigen Star, den ich seh', ist dein Mercedes-Stern
Dir geht es nur darum, dein Gewissen zu erleichtern
Um andere Menschen mit der Geschichte zu begeistern
Nein! Doch! Ich weiß, was du vorhast!
Du hast nicht recht, nur weil du das letzte Wort hast
Ich verstehe, du bist abgefuckt und mies gelaunt
Deine Argumente sind nicht stärker, wenn du schreist und laut
Bist, beruhig dich, ich bin nicht dein Feind
Ich bin hier, um dir zu helfen! Meine Antwort ist nein!
Geh weg, wenn du mir helfen willst
Wir beide sind schon lange nicht mehr in demselben Film
Denn jeder von uns hat ein Lenkrad in seiner Hand, womit er seine Kurve dreht
Glänze wie ein Diamant, solang' sich deine Uhr noch dreht
Spar dir bitte diese Möchtegern-weise-Sprüche
Ich will nix mehr davon hören, das Leben reißt mich in Stücke

Egal, ob Beats bauen, rappen oder Texte schreiben Kianush ist eine Macht
Damals, als alle meine Leute noch auf Party ging’
Hatt’ ich kein Interesse an Bitches und paar Bacardi-Drinks
Ich jagte den Traum, den ich noch bis heut verfolg’
Guck mich an, ich mach’ meine Familie und meine Freunde stolz
Ich liebe dieses deutsche Volk, doch leider gibt es ein Problem
Nicht alle werden gleich behandelt, Dirty X, Life is Pain
Ich wuchs auf mit Staub und Beton
Von dort, wo ich komm’, gibt’s noch tausende Jungs
Die drauf warten, dass ich wiederkehre mit Wasser und Brot
Der Hunger macht uns ?, deswegen paffen sie Dope
Ich knacke den Code und öffne den Tresor
Ich scheiß’ auf dein Cash, mir ging es nur um dein Wort
Die Steine, die ihr legt, sind die Mauern meines Königreichs
Jetzt hab’ ich endlich die Möglichkeit

Die Reise geht los
In einer Welt voller Raps und Beats
Ich hab’ mir alles selber damals beigebracht
Immer dann, wenn ich Texte schrieb
Und ich wollte immer nur mehr Bass, he, Bass
Für die Leute mit Ghettoblaster
Ich wollte immer nur mehr Bass, he, Bass
Ah, gib mir mehr, okay, hör zu

Ich hab’ mir alles selber beigebracht
Egal, ob Beats bauen, rappen oder Texte schreiben, Kianush ist mies drauf
Ich hatte keine Ahnung, wie das funktioniert
Heute rapp’ ich so, dass die Flügel meiner Lunge vibrieren
Rythms werden programmiert, Texte drauf von ganz alleine
Energie wird konzentriert und lass’ meinen Gedanken freien Lauf
Keine Grenzen mehr, die Verbindung wird hergestellt
Ich knüpfe die Kontakte in einer hüpfenden verrückten Welt
Rapper schlüpfen gerne in Rollen und wollen Theater spielen
Aber kriegen Backpfeife von der Realität
Party people, feiern laut und machen den Sklaven Tanz
Ballern sich mit Drogen voll und landen dann am Straßenrand
Ah, ich bin das Gegenteil von negativ
Sag wie deep, zehntausende Kilometer tief
Kianush, das, was du da hörst, ist Original
Ihr werdet für jedes verfickte Wort bezahlen

Kianush,"Ich bin genau wie du, ich bin aus Haut und Fleisch
Wir sind nur kleine Partikel zwischen Raum und Zeit
Wir werden müde und fallen in den Schlaf
Wir werden alt und lassen allmählich nach
Alles um mich herum verschwindet, wenn ich trinke
Doch eines Tages überwind’ ich diesen Gipfel
Es ist nicht einfach ohne Knete in den Taschen
Die Leute kriegen Hunger und betätigen die Waffen
Alles beginnt in deinem Kopf als Gedanke
Und endet dort, wo die Junkies den Stoff immer tanken
Die Jungs wollen Cash und drehen krumme Dinger
Landen dann im Knast und wischen Trän’ um den Finger
Drei Minuten reichen nicht, um alles zu erklären
Mit der Zeit wuchsen Stacheln um mein Herz
Und lieber sterb’ ich wie ein Mann als zu leben wie ’ne Ratte
Bevor ich meinen Kopf senke, zieh’ ich meine Knarre

Ich bin so-o wie du
Keiner kann mich verändern
Doch warum hört ihr nicht zu?
Ich will nur, ich will nur
Ich bin so-o wie du
Keiner kann mich verändern

Ich will nur, ich will nur Mensch sein

Mann, ich bin so wie du ich bin aus Fleisch und Blut
Ich habe alles, was ich brauche - mir geht’s eigentlich gut
Ich hab’ ein’ guten Job und ich verdiene zwar
Doch damit muss ich meine Rechnung und Miete zahlen
Der Anzug, die Uhr und das Auto
Bringt dir alles nix, wenn du alleine in deinem Haus wohnst
Warum ich immer noch den Ring trage?
Weil es mich daran erinnert, dass ich da draußen noch ein Kind habe
Ich betäube den Schmerz mit Alkohol
Guck’ in den Spiegel und sag’: „Krass, bin ich alt geworden!“
Ich bin zwar frei, trotzdem fühl’ ich mich wie gefangen
Ich hab’ kein’ Bock mehr, ich bin müde von diesem Kampf
Von meiner Frau hab’ ich mein Herz aus meiner Brust gerissen
Jeder Mann würde zuhause ohne Luft ersticken
Kannst du den Hass in meinen Augen sehen?
Ich wollte einmal lachen und bezahlte dann mit tausend Trän’

Du warst noch damals klein, aber heute bist du endlich groß
Jetzt kann ich mit dir wie ein Mann reden, setz dich, los
Auf der Straße ist kein Glück im Spiel (nein)
Hör mir zu, bevor die Zellentür sich hinter deinem Rücken schließt
Ah, stopp, warte, bevor du mir 'ne Predigt hältst
Was soll ich machen? Meine Eltern hatten wenig Geld
Alles, was ich habe, muss ich selber finanzieren
Und denkst du wirklich, dass die Welt sich dafür interessiert?
Ich war genau wie du, als ich in deinem Alter war
Ich warne dich, da draußen lauern überall Gefahren
Ach, ich halt’ mich wach, indem ich meine Nase weiß puder’
Was hast du gesagt? Ab jetzt haben wir Streit, Bruder
Ey, nimm die Finger von mir weg und lass mich los
Guck dich doch mal an, du siehst so aus als wärst du fast schon tot
Ist dir das alles die Tränen deiner Mutter wert?
Tief in deinem Innern steckt doch immer noch ein guter Kern!
Ich bin kein Kind mehr, ich kann selbst auf mich aufpassen
Und du bist nicht mein Vater, der sich schnell aus dem Staub machte
Der kein Geld in unser Haus brachte
Ein Scheiß-Alkoholiker, den keiner hält, wenn er mal ausrastet
Erwartest du etwa mein Mitgefühl?
Dass eine Träne mein Gesicht berührt? Ich bin dafür nicht der Typ
Das ist kein Grund, sein Leben einfach wegzuschmeißen
Dein Kapitel und du blätterst in den letzte Seiten
Was willst du mir erzählen, was ich noch nicht gesehen hab’?
Ich kenne meine Fehler, also mach hier nicht auf Lehrer!
Genau das sagt jeder - bis er dann im Knast landet
Und deine ganze Familie von dir Abstand nimmt
Hör damit auf und mal den Teufel nicht an die Wand
Und bist du weg, hat deine Freundin ’nen andren Mann
Weißt du was? Ich will die Scheiße nicht mehr hören!
Bruder, geh mir aus dem Weg, ich bin bereit, um zu zerstören
Ich hab’ du hast nix, außer Hass und blinde Wut
Du bist verantwortlich für das, was diese Kinder tun
Bist du ein Bulle oder was? So läuft das hier am Randbezirk
Junkies ballern Stoff in ihre Vene, bis die Hand vibriert
Hörst du die Sirene? Wie sie näher kommt?
Kannst du mir verraten, wie ich ansonsten die Familie ernähren soll?
Zeit ist wertvoll, triff nur die richtige Entscheidung
In einer scheiß Situation zu einem sehr schlechten Zeitpunkt
Wir haben genug geredet, psch, ich will nix mehr hören
Du machst ein’ großen Fehler und den bereust du später
Was ist mit dir los? Ich weiß doch, was ich tue
Alter, laber mich nicht voll, Mann, und lass mich in Ruhe

Lieber mach' ich meine Familie anstatt die Straße stolz
Hier ist alles fake, alles aufgesetzt

Komm back, pump Raps und hör zu
Meine Drumsets misshandeln deine ganze Crew
Wenn ich rappe, macht es: Bumm, bang, bu-bumm
Ich pumpe bös, immer noch der Killer zwischen all diese Hundesöhnen
Dirty-X, mein Ghettotape pumpen sie im tief gelegten Escalate
Ihr fickt euch für Cash und Fame
Let it rain, ich lade Viren in das Game
Warte, ich programmiere ein System und hab’ gleich alle Daten
Die ich benötige im Kampf gegen Könige
Ich mache das Unmögliche wahr, ich bin digital
Und immer noch der Typ, der die Boots trägt
Und alles kaputtmacht, wenn er in die Booth geht
Das ist mein Territorium, ? Beats, Classic
Checkte meine Box-Premium, auf jeden Beat rapp’ ich
Mit dem Druck einer Packung Dynamit
Life is Pain ist eine neue Dynastie

Ich wuchs auf in deinem Haus, hab’ gepennt auf deiner Couch
Alle lachten, weil keiner hat gesteckt in meiner Haut
Ich war noch klein, ein Junge, der nicht wusste, was er will
Aber später ergab dieses Puzzle hier ein Bild
Aber du wolltest, dass ich deine Bücher lese und werde wie du

Du führst Krieg, nur damit es uns hier gut geht

Du bist der Grund, warum ich rappe und ein Album bring’
Und jedes einzelne Wort hab’ ich von dir gelernt

Am Tag meiner Geburt nahmst du mich in deinen Arm
Mein’ Namen, Bruder, gab mir meine Mum
Aber du gabst mir den Plan, denn woanders hätte ich nicht mal die Wahl
Ich kenn’ deine Intrigen und Gefahren
Für die Freiheit, die du einem gibst, muss man teuer bezahlen
Ich habe dich geliebt und ich wär’ für dich verblutet
Deine Gutmütigkeit ist in Wahrheit Betrug
Wir befinden uns im freien Fall
Ich war süchtig nach dei'm Halt, aber genau so wurd’ ich eiskalt
Du hast nie um mich gekümmert
Du behütest deine Lügen, denn die Wahrheit liegt unter den Trümmern
Wir lieben dich, obwohl du deine Fehler wiederholst
Auch wenn ich bei dir groß wurde, war ich nie dein Sohn
Wir kennen uns gut, aber dennoch ist die Zeit begrenzt
Denn wenn der Tag kommt, werden wir uns beide trennen

Kianush,"Baby, weißt du noch früher
Von uns beiden war keiner ein Lügner
Geliebt und geschätzt, vor dir hat' ich Riesen Respekt
Ständig deinen Namen verteidigt
Hab' doch gesagt, ich bin da, wenn es Streit gibt
Heute start' ich den Tag mit der Einsicht
Weil du weg bist, nicht mehr da bist
In mir staut sich die Hektik und Panik
Sex mit dir ein Mix aus Englisch und Spanisch
Beiß mir in mein Ohr, ich hör' wie du atmest
Krallst dich an mir fest, du schreist, du bist Wahnsinn
Deine Nägel bohren sich tief in die Haut
Du weißt, was du willst, gehörst zu den miesesten Frauen
Und ich bin bereit, um zu killen, also komm näher

Baby, komm näher
Baby, komm näher (Kianush!)
Baby, komm näher (Cedric!)
(Wir holen uns die Diamantas!)

Ich erinner' mich noch gut als wir uns das erste Mal sahen
Ich gebe zu, es fiel mir verdammt schwer etwas zu sagen
Denn du gabst mir den Rhythmus und ich folgte dir
Die Anderen haben dir doch immer nur was vorgespielt
In deine wunderschöne Stimme, Baby, hat sich mein Ohr verliebt
Aus deinem Mund klingt jedes Wort so wie ein Lied
Ist schon komisch wie wir beide uns verändert haben
Ob in guten oder schlechten Zeiten seit dreizehn Jahren
Und noch bis heute, unsere Liebe ist stark
Ich rappe auf den Beat deinen Part
Ich liebe deine Art wie du guckst und spielst mit deinen Haaren
Du kannst dich sicher fühlen, denn du liegst in meinem Arm
Der ganze Boden bebt, wenn du laut wirst und streitest
Heute geh' ich aus die Haustür, alleine
Meine kleine süße Lady
Sei nicht länger böse, Gefühle sind crazy

Du bist meine Droge und ich brauche deine Kicks
Und egal was ihr bietet, ich tausche gegen nichts
Alles was auch kommt, wird auch wieder gehen
Aber du bleibst für immer bei mir stehen
Du bist meine Droge und ich brauche deine Kicks
Und egal was ihr bietet, ich tausche gegen nichts
Alles was auch kommt, wird auch wieder gehen
Aber du bleibst für immer bei mir stehn'

Du bist mein Diamant!
Kein Anderer fasst dich an!
Ich geh' für dich in den Kampf, oh!
Du bist mein Diamant!
Kein Anderer fasst dich an!
Ich geh' für dich in den Kampf (oh, ooh!)

Ohh, mein Dia-, mein Diamant

Kianush,"Ich erinner' mich noch gut an die Zeit, als ich nix hatte
Mir geht es gut, Mama, guck, ich mach' jetzt dick Patte
Sie wollten nur, dass ich brav in die Schule geh'
Ich hab' nicht zugelassen, dass sie mir die Zukunft nehmen
Ich war der Erste in dem Viertel, der die Scheiße rappte
Ich kannt' nur Tupac, DMX und Michael Jackson
1996, damals noch neun Jahre
Und heute leb' ich das, was ich damals geträumt habe
Leute sagen „Lass die Finger weg von dem Rapbusiness!“
Die Leute, die das sagen, sind heute blacklisted
Ich hab' keine Zeit für dein'n Quatsch, ich muss Cash machen
Die Familie ruft, Baba, das ist Chefsache
Und wenn es sein muss, mach' ich's mit der Brechstange
Ich musste einstecken, so wie ein Crashdummy
Jeder, der mich kennt, weiß genau, dass ich mein Leben opfer'
Ich nehm' euch alle mit nach oben wie ein Helikopter

Es fing alles an mit Rap zwischen Glocks und dem Bullen
Aus dem dreizehnten Stock, Digga, kommen die Kanonen
Meine Drumsets gehen durch die Decke wie Atom
Ich rappe für die Generation, rappe für die Generation
Rappe für die Generation, rappe für die Generation
Ich rappe für die Generation, rappe für die Generation

Yeah, was hab' ich dir gesagt, wenn ich komme?
Nach meiner Platte spielt dein Vertrag keine Rolle
Du kommst mit deinem Modescheiß nicht in meine Zone rein
Warum guckst du so als ob du grad in 'ne Zitrone beißt?
Huh, es ist viel zu vieles vorgefallen
Wir gehen alle auf die Knie, bevor wir fallen
Vor paar Jahren sah das alles hier noch anders aus
Rapghettosuperstars kommen aus dem Underground
Push es bis zum Limit, pump den Rhythm mitten in der City
Komm mit mir, ich kille alle Rapper mit dem
Neunmillimeterflow, Jackpot, dein Telefon weg
Ihr seid herzlich willkommen in meinem Ghettoproject
Ich folg' nur meinem Instinkt, der General
Ihr Blindfische seid alle gefickt von der Handywelt, ich sende Wellen
Bevor der letzte Engel fällt
Leute töten sich gegenseitig für eine Menge Geld

Kianush,"Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Meine Hülle ist in hunderttausend Stücke zerfallen
Ich brauche Abstand von allem, Facebook und Smartphones
Hazeduft und Grasjoints und dem Fakepussystarzeug
Was du hörst, ist das Feuer meiner Seele
Matrix, Menschen werden gesteuert wie Geräte
Willkommen in meinem Atelier
Jeder Song ist wie ein Kunstwerk, ich bin ein Künstler im Grundkern
Keiner kannte Rap von uns, jeder hat nach Geld gesucht
Vierzehn Jahre später hör' ich Lieder, die ich selbst erschuf
Ich wuchs auf in einem Hochhausblock
Als kleiner Junge wollte ich schon immer groß rauskommen
Aber heute will ich nur noch eine Hütte im Wald
Durch zu viel Stress bekam ich eine Lücke im Bart
In meinem Kopf sind viel zu viele Schüsse gefallen
Zwischen den Zeilen erkennst du den inneren Feind

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All
Ich kann euch alle nicht mehr sehen
Verschwindet aus mei'm Leben! 
Oder haben wir ein Problem?
Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All

Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All
Ich kann euch alle nicht mehr sehen
Verschwindet aus mei'm Leben! Oder haben wir ein Problem?

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Denn wenn es hier so weitergeht, Bruder, drücke ich ab
Ich seh' die Blicke, die mich brechen sollen
Neidische Versager, die nichts haben und sich deshalb mit mir messen wollen
Geldgeile Bitches im Spotlight auf Koks
In meinem Leben gab es leider keine Hochzeit in Rom
Es ist immer noch derselbe Krieg
Denn ich habe früh gelernt, dass es hier auf dieser Erde keine Helden gibt
Jeder kannte Rap von uns, keiner hätte dran geglaubt
Heute fahr' ich AMG und mach' im Monat zwanzigtausend
Geld ist da, doch ich spür' immer noch denselben Hass
Nur für bisschen Seelenfrieden geb' ich dir die Hälfte ab
Ich spür' den Schmerz so wie Stiche im Hals
Denn ohne dich in meinem Leben ist es bitterlich kalt
Ich zitter' am Leib, wer kann mich von den Gittern befreien?
Ich möchte Ruhe und brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald

Ich brauch' nur eine Hütte im Wald
Und lass' die Erde hinter mir wie 'ne Rakete im All
Ich kann euch alle nicht mehr sehen

Kianush,"Die unendliche Reise
In die Ferne, ohne Rückkehr
Ich lege mein Handy beiseite
Bevor ich in dieser Welt noch verrückt werde
Ich führe ein ernstes Gespräch
Du hörst mir nicht zu, ignorierst du mich etwa?
Ein schmerzvoller Weg
Aber nach der Träne spürst du, wie die Wirkung dich ändert
Zu der Zeit gab's keine Smartphones
Von damals blieben nur noch 'n paar Jungs
Sozialamt, kein Para auf Kontos
Sorry Mama, ich wurde meinen Job los
Leider gab es für mich keine andere Option
Außer Drama mit Waffen und Munition
Sorry Vater, denn ich war immer nur stoned
Dieses Gangstergelaber, ich schäme mich so
Meine Seele war tot, ich hatte kein'n Plan
„Beruhig dich, mein Sohn! Die Welt ist kein Spaß
Lach, wenn du lachen musst wein, wenn du weinen willst.
Eh, sei der Mensch, der du sein willst.
Mach dir keine Sorgen um uns, alle deine Worte sind Kunst.“
Eh, mach das Mic laut, dreh den Scheiß auf
Ich muss reinhauen, ich hab' keine Zeit für den Streit, yo
Sorry Mama, dass ich doch nicht so brav war
Wie du es für die Zukunft geplant hast
Ich bin da, Mom, wovon ich immer geträumt hab'
Nur ein Junge aus Deutschland
Ich erinner' mich noch ganz gut
An die Zeiten, damals mit Mahmut
Von schwarzen Masken und Handschuhen
Zu den Plastikkarten im Anzug
Mach' ein'n Stadtflug in 'nem Jumpsuit
Fliege weg ohne Navigation
Denn ich rapp' für die Generation

Aus dem dreizehnten Stock
Pump' ich den Sound durch die Blocks
Ich sitz' und schreib' meine Songs
Und hab' Ideen in meinem Kopf
Ich hör' den Beat und hebe ab
Produzier' Musik jede Nacht
Ich dreh' den Pegel immer auf
Und keiner ruft hier die Cops
Willkommen in meinem Viertel, wo jeder Zweite leider keinen Job hat
Wo der Sohn von meinen Nachbarn, seinen Rucksack voller Stoff hat
Ich erinner' mich noch gut
Als ich selber noch so war
Ich zahlte mit Schweiß, Tränen und Blut
Und brachte mein'n Arsch in die Charts
Ich hol' uns eine Mille mmit dem neunmillimeter-scharfen Flow
Auch ohne eine Brille werden hier in meinem Viertel Stars geboren
An alle meine Leute, die da draußen grade meine Mucke pumpen
Wir fliegen alle hoch bis an die Spitze, denn wir kömmen alle von da unten
Und bitte Mama, mach dir keine Sorgen, denn dein Junge hat 'n Plan
Mache alle meine Worte, die ich grade sag', eines Tages wahr
Alle meine Worte, die ich grade sage, mach' ich eines Tages wahr
Schwör' auf meine Mama, gib mir noch ein paar Jahre
Und ich baller' alles weg, merk dir meinen Namen

Hast du nicht mehr zu bieten? Geh mir aus den Augen oder zieh die Knarre

Gestern noch schlief ich draußen auf der Parkbank
Fick das Sozialamt, Leute werden kriminell
Wegen Geldmangel, willkommen in der echten Welt

Wir beide saßen damals im selben Gefängnis
Wir drehten Runden im Freistundenhof
Ich saß wegen Raub und er wegen Einbruch und Koks, eh

Eh, es geht blitzschnell
Du machst dick Geld, ah, bis man dich dann vor Gericht stellt

Werden meine Leute gezwungen zur Kriminalität
Polizei kommt, renn so weit du kannst!
Wenn sie dich bekommen, ruf deinen Anwalt an!

Und keiner merkt von euch, dass unter dem Wagen zwei Packungen Semtex sind

Kianush,"Ich kenne Cops in meiner Stadt, die meine Mucke pumpen
Wir waren auf derselben Schule, früher gute Kumpels
Wir spielten Fußball und wurden groß im selben Viertel
Keiner von uns wusste damals, wo die Welt uns hinbringt, ah
Du hast gelacht, weil ich scheiße rappte
Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass du mal die Seite wechselst
Wie auch immer, ich bin immer noch derselbe Kerl
Wir wissen alle, was ihr ohne eure Eltern wärt
Ich machte Daddy stolz auch ohne Abitur
Mit sechs war ich süß, Pottschnitt und Bugs-Bunny-Schuhe
Und in dem Alter, wo die Jungs dann auf Partys fuhr'n
Machte ich Musik, baute Beats, bis der Magen knurrt
Mich sahst du niemals am zocken in der Spielothek
Stattdessen lernte ich wie man selber seine Videos dreht
Gib mir das Mic und ich zeig' dir, wie man richtig rappt
Nur ein falsches Wort und die Hälfte vom Gesicht ist weg

Sie reden irgendwas von wegen „Alles nur korrupt
Alles eine Lüge, sie verkaufen uns nur Hollywood!“
Alkohol trinkende Fettsäcke laufen rum
Hunderttausend Bodyguards gegen hunderttausend Jungs
Verschwörungstheorien sind aufgetaucht
Alle labern Scheiße, keiner weiß mehr, was er glauben soll
Die Autos brennen, überall fliegen Molotovs
Polizisten tragen eine Rüstung so wie RoboCop, ah
Ich weiß, du kommst vom Ponyhof
Deswegen machst du aus dem Rap deine Modenshow
Ihr seid alle nicht mehr cool, wenn die Kohle kommt

For its such a lovely day
To have to always feel this way
And the time that I will suffer less
Is when I never have to wake

The blackness of darkness forever
Wandering stars, for whom it is reserved
The blackness of darkness forever

Those who have seen the needles eye, now tread
Like a husk, from which all that was, now has fled
And the masks, that the monsters wear
To feed, upon their prey

Wandering stars for whom it is reserved
The blackness of darkness forever
Wandering stars for whom it is reserved
The blackness of darkness forever

Doubled up inside
Take awhile to shed my grief

Doubled up inside

Kid Brother Collective,"Hold back the words that say I won't be here,
Build up the nerve and switch to second gear.
Coffee stains tell me I should stay,
But tomorrow there's nothing left,
But these two paintings on my wall,
Showing everything we've lost.
And I forget how it ever got this far,
Those nights are never far enough away from me.
Last night the wind became my voice,
But you did all the dreaming for us both.
Last night I didn't have a choice,
Cause you did all the dreaming for us both.
I can't forget,
The way we held on to our pain,
And tried to dry off in the rain.
When we first met,
And all the times we never had,
Those nights are never far enough away from me.
And I remember how I'd wake up so uncomfortable,
Did anything we ever did make sense?
And how I'd get sometimes knowing you were there with me... now I know I never slept at all.",Insomnia

And I smoke green from Cali, I'm wild at the rally
I'm ill like shack in the paint with the alley

Ayo my nigga Kid Capri will shit on y'all tracks
And we ain't got no love for y'all tracks
We love big ass keys and y'all like little ass cracks

I could rock a rhyme as quick as I could clock a knot
Y'all niggaz clockin' mine, cus I'm getting lots of shine
The Kid Capri could be the cat, that could change the face of rap
Let me hear you trace the map, the Bronx is were the stations at
The fake foes hangin' out with fake hoes

Cus you lacking every day, Pun make these rappers pay

Ayo is your man from Puerto Rico
That slaughter people like raw perico
I'm for the people, five power not a total recall
Look out your people on a blood shoot baby blues
Look at my geezmo got shot and barely made it news
How many crews I gotta run through when it comes through
Getting raw I'm the predator, I'ma Hunt you
Niggaz think is something sweet on the fuckin street
But I'll be there busting my heat, when there's nuttin' to eat
Fuck it I cheat cus that's the ghettos anthem
I know the devils laughing every time he hears somebody's metal clappin'
Ain't no napping in the city cus it never sleeps
Wake up like what happen when I bust a cap on your feather geez

So many tried so I seen the petty pass by
Listen as I take you on a mission with precision
Like a brown cent went on a hunt
Worldwide searchin for the true ingredients 
To make the pi ?? 6
Shorty want to hound me for a flick
But I got my chips, you gettin visions of my lips
Dicks swang, it don't mean a thang 
'cause when I was down, you was on the other side of town
Getting done by Starang, when he was in range
Now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
Puttin my time to you broke bitches
Don't do shit but stress me out, now I'm back in my riches
To get my blue print down to my very last dot
Every move every motivation that I need
Ain't no hesitation when it comes to rockin when we speak
Just follow my lead on this jou-rney

You never heard another MC like me
Follow my lead on the jour-ney
You never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey
You never heard another Mc like me
So poetically on point its ridiculous
Hittin every key bassline when I'm rippin this
Don't act like this ain't the shit right now
You know my hits make you want to dance
But you still sittin down
Dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
And don't bother to quote one note
Or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
'cause in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
This ain't the battle between the two best no more
Survival of the fittest...this shit is war
If you got your eyes open, you can see the light
If you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

So many people took my lyrics and hooks
If I wrote a book about you crook niggas gettin shook
In a hot second, I'm a get the hot-steppin
On first, when I'm on my verse, niggas need a nurse
Without the kill patient, ain't no hesitation 
Bring your weapon like your military mind 
And steppin on E, times over for you Mc's

I'm ageless  pageless  only want me for that thing 
Hang up the phone  wants to let it ring

Want some verbal spit from the semi-auto lip

Lookin' at a map, one chick on my lap

All you see is ankles (yeah what) from the front to the back

Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes

Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
but it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow

the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

Kid Capri,"Yeah once again presenting  
Kid Capri 
Ras Kass the waterproof M.C. 
Punchline 

These fagot M.C's be on skis with the microphone though 
But it's all downhill hitting trees like Sonny Bono 
Name a nigga I couldn't burn and he probably created the Earth in six days 
I shot at Jesus with a tech fives times 
Hanging the pope with six strings  the name is Ras Kass 
Might eat a little pussy but I don't kiss ass homeboy 
I'm righteous and wicked and this acquisition of riches is like 
Selling bean pods and still fucking white bitches 

I rap crazy, you better get fifty niggas to blaze me 
Or ace me, been rhyming since 220 AD 
You feel gazy?, I'm top ten with the raps 
Off the list you scratch, like serial numbers on gats 
I lace tracks with ill lines 20 bar rhymes 
My verses got long sentences like jail times 
Press rewind, listen to jams when I cool out 
I only fuck a bitch in the park if she juiced out 
Going new routes to maintain my composure 
Anticipated while you still screaming to get exposure 
Rap soldier in the cipher I'm first to set it 
My lyrics get the U.S. Open without playing tennis 

Vindictive my voice pitch is beyond John Blaze 
I'm John Cremation, you conversation with aspirations 
Of me leaving blood stains from Earth to Venus 
Them so-called rap stars will still be living 
with they moma like an unborn fetus 
As soon as you step on stage I'ma destroy you with the truth 
Like the Ricki Lake show, don't come out the soundproof booth 
Or poof, plucked in your bubblegoose 
A lost angel, I strangle at an angle that's obtuse 

Yo, my styles viscous, put niggas before bitches 
Collect riches, bone chickens without trickin' 
And stay spitting mad rhymes in your direction 
Always repping get you open like seasections 
I rhyme greata set it off without Jada 
My flava' leave a nigga shook like vibrators 
Rap composer of the hit your styles over 
I make an M.C. cry just like Robin on Ophra 
Give you the cold shoulder guess who rhymes slicker 
I gross figures, shed light on shady niggas 
And write rhymes, roast niggas that take mine 
Gave birth to so many styles I should have my tubes tied 
One time, when rappers need concentration 
Embarrass I nigga, like getting caught masterbating 
I'm fascinating, I make you wallow in your sorrow 
Clutch the bottle you get your childish style fondled 
My rap tactics make you want to go home and practice 
Match this, drop jewels like Biago Rackis 
I come rough for all niggas that front 
I'm all that five mics and quotable for the month 

I be on some bullshit like the unamits and vigorous rhyming 
And until Buchwhick Bill starts dunking on Kobe Bryant 
I'm applying pressure, check out my melody 
The eighteenth letter, the first letter 
the nineteenth letter for cheddar 
And get a barrette explosive tip shredders to make the rum-redder 
To make the deader then Coretta 
Scott King's husband who had a dream 
I get in you with no Vaseline 
And burn rubber so I tap that ass like Savion Glover  

That the sedative cause your shits repetitive 
And played out, tried to run game but it got rained out 
Wasn't thinking about this style until we came out 
Took a detour when some of y'all went the same route 
Thoughts about doing Punchline make me tickle 
When my flow changes like pennies, dimes and nickels 
Organized rhymes we make the girls realize 
We humiliate niggas like a small dick size 
Now you want to click nines, front and sip wines 
Take mine, can't mess with Ras and Punchline",One on One
Kid Capri,"featuring Slick Rick  Snoop Doggy Dogg 

I falls off into a party in the N.Y.C. 
Niggaz lookin at me strange but they lovin my chain 
Bang bang  same thang  game came when I left em

But I'm his Royal Slickness  ghetto weakness  come Rick is

Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

I sure bet my daddy proud,
A little nigga with a shaker smile,
On top of the dreams is where I'm found.
Some figured I was Satan-bound,
Until I came back with the style I found,
Then all of the sudden they fixed they're faces
Cause of who I know, and the trail of places,
That I've stepped, how many niggas wanna hate cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack,
Cause I'm risking my soul attack, now I'm heard all over the map.

All that really matter is where you're goin' go,
Baby I'm stayin' for somethin',
But you can't rule out this caps of gun

All you gotta do is take advantage,
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage,

I'm a soul, nah homie, not even,
I'm a zone now till I lose feeling,
Remember I'm a be gone way past November,
Even stay up there, up there, floatin', floatin', hopin' I could find peace somewhere.

In my mind, it sounds like ooh,
When I'm gone it feels like ooh,
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feelin' alright, I'm feelin' alright I forget about it all.

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feeling like Shallow Hal,
Diamonds on the Jesus peace for style,
Back into the city right around,
Greetin' my niggas with dap 'n' pounds,
So if I fall I won't hit the ground,
These are the things that a make me smile,
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while,
I keep myself so lifted,
I am accustomed to new heights,
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless,
See what I might flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
How are my jokes? They will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans,
More than likely I am faded man
Doin' other shit get ready where you goin',
Niggas just stand around hatin'
So my vice ace is when
The lights start flashin' 'n' I'll be soaring all alone 'n',
In the place my mind is going fill with songs and no-ones knowin'
And the devil with the harpin' dress tryin' ask me for one dance,
He think he slick but my guardians protects me from his wrath,
So in my place no hate shall enter, livin' high up there up there
Copin', copin', floatin', I will find peace somewhere

In my mind, it sounds like ooh
When I'm gone, it feels it likes ooh

Kid Cudi,"Easy...
This is easy, Sunday morning
We're right here on a beautiful morning in Cleveland, Ohio
And it's chilly today, the kids are going to school
The grass is frosty
Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out, in the morning
Hello Cleveland

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be asking
That kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga pass and
We getting to the cash and, you can see a nigga shining
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find 'em, unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
'Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves
On out and free my scalp
I need to free my mind, a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Dont really like sipping 'cause I get to tripping
My nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a lil bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by the 5-0
""Sir you look high""
""I know, but I prefer my eyes low""

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher, oh, oh yeah we get so high

Yeah, they say easy friend
There he go talking about weed again
Probably 'cause all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss what
A nigga trying to get you thinking about
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff puff pass with your bitch ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict
Tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down see my Jesus piece shining
Good look Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling Jack
Let's go

And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher, oh, oh yeah we get so high",Hyyerr

Long before we know ourselves,
Our paths are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
And issues never before heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,
But his dreams too.
This is the story of The Man On The Moon.",In My Dreams [Cudder Anthem]

Uh, simple as that for your simple ass
Simple way I wish you woulda called it how it shoulda been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't know the deal
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly how the older the rappers' kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil momma switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that
As simple as (1, 2, 3)

What a world that I'm livin' in,
Will the rainstorms ever end?
Steal I feel my, path narrow, I run again,
Seen happiness is gone again,
And then you see 'em,
Grey clouds up above mane,
Metaphor to my life mane,
Still feel my  heart stronger then it's ever been,
Strong will til my journey ends 'till then I roll,
More then I've ever rolled
Not pills but the Mary though
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days goes,
Nothing helping with my head dose, but I ain't sleep,
Awake in another state,
Livin' in a new space,
Still I feel my mind runnin' at a steady pace,
God help me so I'll win the race

Lining piercing to another land
Over the desert where the lost play,
Sole searching each and every way,
An then you see tha,
Awesome sounds so profound,
When it, it'll grip you, you can see it,
If you hear you can feel it too,
Somethin' special I am runnin' to,
'Till then I go, away very far away,
To another universe where all the people say,
Its the new new place for the special to embrace,
Like a martian you seemingly,
Wandered out the place,
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful,
Even if you drown you'll be floatin' higher above it,
You can say bye bye bye,
Sky might be fallin' but remember you can fly high.

Kid Cudi,"I got ninety nine problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree living
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louie
I'm the Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You know how I be when you start livin' large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself, why he by himself?
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister got me fly when she could
But they all didn't see,
The little bit of sadness in me, Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life (yeah, yeah)
The soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of 'shrooms just so I could see the universe
I tried to think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancun
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try to shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam'

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life
The soundtrack to my life

I was close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slitting my throat
Ignorance the cope man
Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love, and I need that shit
If I never did shows, then I'd probably be a myth
If I cared about the blogs, then I'd probably be a jack-ass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see thirty
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down, pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you
It's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life,
The soundtrack to my life
To my life

A new level of growth he must confront himself.

Enter galactic you and me 

I once dreamt of peace until I found you, 
Once upon a time baby, 
I once had a dream so sweet until I had a taste of you, 
Once upon a time baby, 
Reaching out to outer space dancing to awesome sounds, 
This all new to you? 
Reaching out to hold your close so I don't slip away, 
Explore a new approach, 
A whole new free I say

But it's easier to just do, 
See, if you can't do what you imagine, 
Then what is imagination to you? 
Just a waste of space in your brain, 
To take the place of hate, 
Or things all the same, 
Tell me your secrets 
The things that make you tick, 
I like it when you talk 
Because your voice is angel'esk (aye), 
I want to kiss you on your space below your naval-et, 
The taste that you keep neat, so moist like a towelette, 
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect, 
Let's not forget the sex,

Yeah my heart you can't collect (now now)
My heart you can't collect (yeah yeah)

Have just one more stem babe.

Get ready, let's go, let's go, hey

Which immediately becomes his sanctuary,

Long before we know ourselves,
Our paths are already set in stone.
Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions
And issues never before heard so vividly and honest.
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself,
But his dreams too.
This is the story of The Man On The Moon.",In My Dreams (Cudder Anthem)

I teach her the son that never gave a fuck about a scantron
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show the world some new colors and scene
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had tree smoked
Black and Mild, how dumb of me now,
I'm grape cigarello man
Any young black kid a guaranteed fan
On a downhill grind and I'm humble

One of my dogs tripping hard talkin' about really killin' them all
I say slow down, slow down
What the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I'll be there in 20 minutes but it only took fifteen
We wasn't that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
No knowing that this was all a set up
Secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They passes move was to slow for me
I pulled up, wasn't no ambulance, there wasn't no police
Something fishy going on, not even kept pressing on
Nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door they shot, I shot, some abrupt shit

I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

Hey, there's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on the model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fit
She like to go the mile, all the while
I can see her tear bit
I forgot her name
Something that sounds like Penelope
May be a French twang to it
Tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, born into racism
She like the young nigga by my brown skin
My shag dog fro
I'm king to her
She will please her friend for me
So funny and they'll starve in the garden
Naked as always, honest
Her hands all over my privates
Lost in the mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood",The Mood

Hate me now then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane,
It's a full time job to not lose my faith
Okay I've been here before,
Alone for the upteenth time or more

When in fact they probably never gave fuck about me

Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off the better, girls they love it, totally
Fuck the blogs, I'mma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the young
To be living 'til their grave
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day
Keep blunts to burn

Pop and lock em and send em on home

Know the code when a women with some toes
Optimo's taking trips to Australia
Do some blow if you make through the show

Go with your soul and try floating through the sky
Hide your pain with some pussy and mimosas

In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you'd understand

I'm living my life as if I got powers

I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird til she sings out
La la la la, body could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala

This is how it's supposed to be

Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money never change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my claims so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks
So for the blunted, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin' if it in in the run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup bitch
And they do with the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing didn't change was my niggas

I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know then please hit me
No question no hesitation when it come to own fam dawg
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin' past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin' and kiss my ass
No sweatin' the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis
Brought me thick and thin 'til we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished
Clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin' away on a bid
Only wanted fly shit when we got big
Chasin' these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so bout it bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families up on our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
So long as I am my brotha's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas

Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash wipe the smirk off their face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on who gon' go half on a zone
Oh, thought I would be done off the coke, no
Let me tell you something ho
Been said everything that shine ain't gold
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be OK, with being demented
By the way nigga these cars ain't rented I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin' no jokin' cudder’s had that itch
So I scratch, so please no more speculation 'bout that

Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted
I’m back so please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted
I’m back, niggas think I’m livin' life paranoid
(Mothafuck that, man)
Aw, they got me twisted, they don’t know that boy
(Mothafuck that, man)
I’m just gettin' busy killin' it, gettin' busy
(Mothafuck them, man)
I just wanna watch it burn, baby, burn
Niggas think I’m living life paranoid

Aw, they got me twisted, they don't know that boy

Think its time I open my mind where I left it
Nigga make it easy, make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to be rewire your whole fucking mainframe
I'm sick of the same, lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless, the lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign, the fucking essence of pain fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell

Cold, bitch you know I'm cold yea
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh so cold

I'm one cold blooded nigga

I love how I can make so many people feel uneasy
Walk right passed I know you hoes see me
Can't deny the shine of a Jedi
World class almighty super Cudder the Godly
Went from divas to smoking 'tiva that was my hobbies
I love shittin' on these niggas that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two one two, assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw it ain’t my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face in, watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was, tell a nigga to speak
Standing in a monsoon of cool, karma is my armor
Was only scared of my father, beyond that I'm

Hmm get in the car y'all just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look so
No groupies, see a blonde girl with a brunette
See a nigga cruising in the red benz
That's a one, two, double up, triple up
So many surprises oh so many colours and sizes
Love them, I want them, they need me

All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out feelin' post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Slim up on that waist, but that ass fit
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind whats on your mind
And tell me somethin' that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colours and sizes

When you live like me, you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-black, half-thai
Don’t be prejudiced, 'cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named maria, its your turn, I love them senoritas
I like to fuck 'em, but then I said fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something
Og too short don't stop

Move and groove, make the bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
I'm up in the hills still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feel
I say that now until I go an pop this pill
I say out loud you wanna let me cop a feel?
Now I pray out loud but I know my god heals
Bounce with me If you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up won't let up on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames they love to speak my name
Sometimes dreams of breakin' niggas whole faces
And fuck the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some xannies and a couple adderall

With the spirit of god and some Gandalf balls, yum

In the SLS stunting and it's all mine

I got jewelry that is sitting on ma' slit wrist
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard here for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I went fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste, no fun, no jokes, no smile
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See I'm in love with you all to the end

Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!""

Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'

Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
And if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father

Save the universe from the forces of evil

As I'm tryna find my way can't nothing hold me though
I say, get a clue, the vibes all around you
Try but you can't deny when its in your soul
Lets take it where there aren't any roads
Where these sucka hatin' niggas can't follow

Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip!

Take flight to the moon

No worries

Come on don't be shy
Let your guard down and work it
Do just what you want
Anything you choose

Have you ever seen the Earth from this view?

And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain

Looking in the mirror is hard, hmm
Some days I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness, hmm
Going on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart flying from here
No more falling apart

Simple hearts but hold up, back in the custom

It would never would occur to people her up-downs
Convertible would murder evil, pup pup hounds
Just been dogging her
Courtesy and real love found, just been dodging her
Mr. man, misogyny hands, been massaging her
If she ran and blew up her town, shit I would pardon her
Put her palm in her scalp, scratch her dandruff
Put her heart in your hand, she threw a tantrum
Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hear they've been telling her nah since forever
Hear some Melvin and Bluenotes is all she know

My murder is all she wrote
Perverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat
All the dirty verdicts, she lie in watching soaps

Out the gutter, I learned to bowl

Now I done had too many sips of different mixes in my system
All these women in my section, it get hard to pay attention
That's my bed, that's yo bed,
Ain't nobody you could be mad at!
Amen for your mally
Every shot automatic
Going crazy in this bitch
Like all the walls are padded
Not in my right mind but my bitch right out the pageant
Tell 'er keep it rollin' (kush) sticky as molasses
See a hole in the swisha, don't worry baby, I'll patch it

Kid Ink,"An honest man often grows cruel
When converted into an absolute prince
Born from power, a bitter from fear
The madness, the treachery
The strong mixture of troubles
It is a man’s own mind
Not his enemy a fool that lures him to evil ways
More than a man, more than a king
More like God!

I feel like like
More than a king, more than a king, more like God
It’s more than a city, more than a village where we are
I feel so super human

Coming in high just to beat yo grace
Wait, everybody sound so reckless
King me, these niggas playin checkers

Name somebody else check the check
In my city protect yo neck
It’s more than a Method Man and you get up
The man of the hour, sold-out shows for someone out

Whole team winnin, OG hit a homerun, we chillin
We don’t talk much to you PC niggas,
It’s showtime, check yo TV nigga
I’m 1080p HD, seeing everything clear through my red eyes
Runnin these streets past me, will get it right when you see a nigga zoom by
Zoom out, you’re standing way too close
Groupie boy worse than a new hoe
Cold heart growin, need a new coat
Too high, tryna find my new low

To me a moving nature
Crosses the line into the relation to other men
A burn appetite and desire
Becomes lust and passion
The dominion that lands to hell over nature
He also seeks to have his brothers
So closely remind of his own proper dominon
And crossing on Gods
Only God is to have dominion over all

Uh, so I just sit back and laugh at em
Blowin kush and success my bad habit
Sacrifices of mine, take a stab at em
Feelin ain’t no man like me since Adams
Ask leaders, actors it’s half Aston
I’m a active, addict but I action
Racks in, racks out, girl keep flashin
Fact is, little life that you niggas fathom
Work hard to ball when ain’t one to pass it
In the past but I was way too passionate
Way too much drive, almost crashin
To the casket, fuck that to the ashes
Uh, burn one nigga, off so much loud, know you heard my nigga
Uh, what’s the word my nigga
Been gone since November my nigga uh
Yea, tell a bitch kick the feet out
Anything she lit, lit me like regal
Lit em on fire, take take em all down
Pull out the shots and take it like pow
Faded off my own strand
Better pull to the side, this is my own lane
Speedin over nigga, hittin corners in a maze
I can see where we going, hope the signs gon change

Fire cooking kush in the blunt, get out the kitchen if it's too humid
The story, the act itself, made way more money without the deal
But I'm doin' this cus I dreamed big
And you already know who the team is

Pair of shades on, who the coolest nigga on sight?
Tell 'em hide that, where the fuck you buy that?

That's 4 if you countin', high as a mountain, all for these ounces
Stuck in the middle of the couch with cotton mouth
I need a sip from the fountain
So gone think I left a couple nugs at ya crib
Make sure you hit a nigga when you found 'em
Blunted, blunted, me and my niggas treat weed like money
Said blunted, blunted, if I smell another seed I'm runnin'
Said, no sticks, takin' shots while you hittin' bricks
Know I got the juice and you niggas nowhere in the mix
Be consistent, what you smoke hit or miss
I roll up OG every intermish
O-OG, make a mothafucka OD
Hit ya body like morphine, army
Babysittin' the blunt, I'll get you a car seat
Fuck what it cost me, these dividends is all goin' to the medicine
It ain't one of the 7 sins, rollin' with these 7 grams
Sorry baby if there's weed hangin' out the end

Kid Loco,"Music is something that should reiterate a thought of the way of life here. It's something that everyone.. kind of takes for granted, that its here. and its going to be around to mean something to a different aspect of your life. and its not something that people get into with the idea that ... become famous and make a lot of money.",Cosmic Supernatural
Kid Loco,"Where are you, now
I can only see your face
That's not good
If only I could forget
I know your hips
I know your zips
I kissed your lips
And everything's so great
What I need baby
Is a little bit of your soul
But you're too cold, baby
And your blood don't flow

Well you taught me
A few tricks in a bed
And that a lover
Can't be your friend
So may be flying
Can be lot of fun
But getting shot
Might be somewhere in the plot

Led me through the night 
Stood against the storm 
And taught me pride 
Did they weigh you down 
Did they boil the salt 
Did they mess you up 
In your fancy loft baby 
Theres a smile that broke my heart 
That sparkles in your eyes 
Your falling apart 
Now your living lies 
Did they change the rules 
Without telling you? 
What a suprise 
Who needs who now baby 
Take a break and come down 
Take a chance and start 
Take a look in the mirror 
Take the pill to wake up 
Take a break and come down 
Take a chance and start 
Take a look in the mirror 
Take the pill to wake up 
Wake up 

Theres a spirit of our youth 
Wont solves your thoughts 
Used to care about truth 
And fight against the odds 
Did they make you trade 
The dreams of old 
Did they tell you 
It was cool to be cold baby 
Theres a light that you once shown 
Clouded you la don ??
Everything is lone 
And everybody is gone 
Was life rough on you 
Did it fit no more 
As we fibbin you to my dorm ??
Now baby

Take a chance and start 
Take a look in the mirror 
Take the pill to wake up

Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs
Not happen between these thighs

The real revolution ain't about booty size
The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives
And though we've lost Biggie Smalls
Baby your notorious revolution
Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush

Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees
Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring
And produce little future emcees
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs
Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep

With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well
Doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now
Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down
Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got
And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot
And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise
Or helping you fantasize
Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs

No no, not between these thighs
Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic
And really fantastic
And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic
You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla, 

Butter pecan, chocolate delux
Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm
You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh
Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just cuz you made a few bucks?
Please brother please

Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave
And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown
Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed
And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes
I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown

You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown
Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go
If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego
We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense
On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense

But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status
To express what you feel
Your revolution will not happen between these thighs
Will not happen between these thighs
Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking

Between these thighs
Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution
You know I'm talking about the revolution
When it comes, it's gonna be real
It's gonna be real

It's gonna be real
When it finally comes
When it finally comes
It's gonna be real, yeah yeah",Your Revolution [DJ Nappa Remix]

And grind on it

I mean push and bump
Cause it's about time we made this party jump
Take a drink of your forty

Some complain
And they got a little fame
And it's a shame

For what its worth

Kinda quick not slow
The rhymes I fit into flow
All in a row, from the intro
To the end so, ho

Step a side as I make room to bloom

As soon as I grip the mic to get loose

Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice

Huh, As I Cramp your style (style...style)

Cramp your style (Cramp your style...cramp your style)

Get down on your knees and pray when I break you
Down with a sound
Comin' down with a pound
Or a bang

If you can't hang with the slang
That I exploit
Comin' straight from Detroit
Rough without a doubt or a question

Kid Rock here in the flesh
And addressin' and defining certain issues
To diss you (he diss me..aheo)
So wipe the tears from your eyes

You can't hide so don't be surprised
When I dismiss you from your throne
And send you home
As a Kid Rock clone

'Cause I can hold my own
Like ya hold a milkbone
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit
So when I hit the skit

That's it
So don't come in face with the base
And remember your just an imitation
Don't get buckwhile

In fact don't smile

D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady
So get ready to feel the pain

I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane
So listen rappers and get to the program
Breakin' ya down is the Kid rock slogan
And any rapper who thinks about dissin'

You know what I'll say?
I got a great big dick
So anyone who can't adjust
Gets rust

Actin a fool in school no one topped us
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious
Drivin a bronco

And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes
And me and Bo got together

Cool as an igloo
And more complex, than a rubix cube

Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run

And as I incline through time to get mine
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks

So I sought and fought
And a lot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked

Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a son of a gun

Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson
Pumpin' the new sounds town to town

Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
I worked and worked and worked and I worked
When many thought I was just gettin jerked

Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance

It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock

And dropped and forgot, now that's hot
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war

Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out
New tax the acts and half the drug industry
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me

Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up
For one to get over, one must get stuck up
One will roll up, another will smoke up
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up

Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air
'Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin for a hooker
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her

For a place to hide and when he got his ride
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died
Her family cried over this homicide
And why they pondered, why she wandered

Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
All to smoke a little cooked up rock
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin'
Come together

From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein
Maybe I'm ahead of my time
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
Surrounded by the Great Lakes

I was once out cold at 15 years old
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks

I was a young bad mother in my own eyes
But now I realize it wasn't too wise
So now I teach, I'll reach to each
And every single individual

Stop the madness
You never had this
Wild style of my b-boy badness
Runnin' the show

Clockin' the dough
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not
I'm Kid Rock
Flat top and all

Not Michael Jackson spinnin' singing off the wall
But making everyone how I thump like thunder
Got over like a mother
While you went straight under

And now you can't stand
The way I jam
Hold the mic in my hand
And rock the whole land

Man get jealous if you want to
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do
'Cause I work to hard to make ends match
Started from scrath

And to a lot of crap
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch
And I'm a bad mother fucker
Believe that

I'll pop on top more flop no stop
Makin' every girl in the house want a piece of the rock
And then I'll bring a new swing
To make it understand the kid's running things

Mostly because I'm not an MC faker
And the rest because I'm the

Microphone master Super Rhyme Maker

Kid Rock,"People like the way my style is rollin'
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin'

Here's how I'm hittin'

Funkin' it up more than George Clinton
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that
I live press the best I won't rest the pest(?)

'Cause I'm blessed and I jus won't settle for less
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up
The one with the hair that stands straight up
People look and stare in shock

Trippin' over a Rock
Trippin' over a Rock

Chased,and chased and chased but never close to caught
And the skills I filled were all self taught
With so many styles on each panfulls(?)
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels

As the girls admire the way I aspire
To move piles of dough in my own empire
Not a liar, I tell no lies
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes

But don't get me wrong I get wicked
Shake that ass in my face and ill stick it
Hit it get wit it
Knock it out the box

Trippin' over a rock
Trippin' over a rock

A genuine badman
Like Yosemite Sam man
I see-see-see-can rock the land
And bring a new swing and sensation

To represent the next generation
So slack up You better back up
Here comes the score and the weed in a jigsaw
Fuck with me

With no doubt
Ill put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
Ill go deep in I won't weaken
Guaranteed to keep the house beepin'

A funky rhythm that you can swing to

Kid Rock that's me
And the party jumpin is what I'm for seeing
So just chill or I'll boot you
Get on me and I'll shoot you

Rock the mic without any fessin
With your blessin
I will get stupid, you didn't know it

I thought you knew it
I'm the kid that comes exactin
With my ace the black man
Two b-boys from the Midwest

Rock the shows 'Cause were professionals

Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

For Kid Rock the new young rap artist
Clockin' paper 'cause I got soul
Comin' at you from the Motor capital

Shakin' booties
Not all the cuties
I'm too cool to be a little fruity
Drinkin' forties every weekend

I'm the master who's always speakin
To some freak and if I freak her
Its at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper
But off that topic got to get it

Super dope, extremely poetic
The K-I-D-are-O-see-Kin
I love girls that's how its layin
With these jammies

Fuck the grammies
All I care about is shaking fannies
And I have been doin it for a long time
But now I'm nineteen

And in my prime
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say

The Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
The Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

On the mico is solo
'cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos
Only rappin 'cause I don't sing dope
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo

Lace up the Reebox
Comb the high top
Black dose with a little hip hop
And I style it with some uniqueness

You say I'm not fresh
But I could careless
When I rock the mic
I'm your girl is likin

? women are not lookin
Create a beat that is fully hookin
'Cause when I get dumb
People ave fun

Kid Rock,"Ahh... 
I`m here and it`s clear I`m gonna flow so yo black
Just get on up or yo get the bozak 
'Cause it ain`t Kojak or Dr. Suess

It`s the kid mother fucker and I`m gonna get loose 
'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows

That I got more riffs than Randy Rhoads 
Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don`t know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I`m slick

I`m nothin but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I

Although I`ve tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I`m trippin on
And O.E. bitch is what I`m sippin on 
A big fat booty`s what I`m grippin on

But for now I`m gonna rock and keep rippin on 
Down to the mother fuckin A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain...Now c`mon why'all and tell me what`s my name

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I`m in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin' 
Taggin' hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock 

I`m true I`m blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I`m a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain`t no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio want to get rich ho 

So count my props you can`t get with me and fuck all you cops you ain`t shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin hard for fun
So stay off my dick becuz I ain`t the one 
And for anyone tryin to bust me up

You better chill with that tryin to fuck me up 
And if you`re talkin shit I`m gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.`s I`m gonna cut ya up 
'Cause I don`t give a fuck about no one

And when I wax I tax and that`s just how it goes son 
Yo ain`t no sucker
'Cause I`m the kid..""rock mother fucker"" 
Straight from Mo-town and I won`t slow down

I cease the cheese M.C,`s I moe down 
And I show no shame 'cause I`m down for mine
Now tell me what`s my name 
It ain`t Eric Clapton and this ain`t slowhand

I`m the kid ya dig and I`m a rock the whole land 
'Cause no man can make a track this grand
And if you know what I know than just...",3 Sheets to the Wind
Kid Rock,"Back from the dead second L.P. here we go
Comin at ya from the R.O.M.E.O. 
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
Hat turned back in some Airwalk jimmys 

Never slackin hoes I be mackin
Not wacked I don't try to act black when 
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt 

Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
Hit bound from the Mo-town allen
Fuck a 40 I drink it by the gallon 
I started out in Mount Clemens as a D.J.

Park parties gettin drunk on Sunday 
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip shit up 
An now I've toured this nation
Pimp of the nation

Pullin hoes 
Rock the set in each city then step
Me, Blackman and Funk Daddy Def Stef 
Bitches, they think I'm sexist

But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast 
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
And gimme a plate of that pussy on the side 
Triple x on the set showin no class

Just a foul mouthed little fuckin smart ass 
No fool I went 2 high school dumb ass 
Smoked dope and I flunked every class 
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash

Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed 
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin grass 
Now I reside on the eastside lovin it

Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it 
Flex, sex, run of the next
Flippin and trippin and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2 
Front an get around 2 the

2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
I'm shakin and takin and breakin I rip the mic like 
Every time fuck I don't eat no manwich
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich 

Somebody said I'm the best in the Mo-town
But this town ain't shit but a ghost town 
Who ever said it they lied they fessed
Bitch I'm the best in the mother fuckin midwest 

Want to be heard when I rap so I yell it
Sport a Tigers cap like my man Tom Selleck 
One bad bitch I smoke hash from a stick
Got more cash than fuckin White Boy Rick 

My first LP wasn't pushed for shit
So Jive Records yo, go and suck a fat dick 
'cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like Hee Haw 

Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down Gratiot 
In my Grand Marquis I pimp to the beat
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat",Back from the Dead
Kid Rock,"A bottle of jack's got my manager grinnin'
Yeah that's me that keeps the turntables spinniN'
I'm countin cards and I keep on winnin'
I know God hates me 'cause I'm always sinnin'

You don't know me blow me ho you want to get hot
You'll get your ass blown out fuckin with the Kid Rock 
Eatin up ya suckers just the same way a beast could
Tearin through your town like mother fuckin Clint Eastwood 

'cause I be fakin the rhymes that keep ya shakin'
Makin a lotta money but don't let me be mistaken
I never thought about climbin up the pop chart
And I don't give a fuck you can't buy my tape in K-Mart 

Give me a choice between soundin like an ass wipe
Or sittin in an alley smokin crack from a glass pipe 
I'd be as skinny as a junkie with the AIDS plague
But still I'd look better than a puppet tryin to get paid 

Now check the rhyme as I climb and I co get rude
And send ya runnin' playin' pussy like Shaggy and Scoob 
'cause I'm the wrong dude to fuck with my mouth is mental
And I'm a tear shit up like they did in South Central 

Son of a bitch I'm the son of a bitch
Nobody ever loved you so you're the son of a dick 
I'm a product of a young girl top in her class
You're a product of a hooker who was sellin that ass 

And your styles in the past it's old and dusty
So from now on I'm callin you M.C. Crusty 
'cause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted
So now I'm gonna drop ya like a hit of acid 

And when I rip ya people they might stare
'cause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair 
An yo buck won't you please be a friend
And tell your mom I want to fuck and I'll pick her up at 10",Blow Me
Kid Rock,"Back in the mother fuckin saddle
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin for a battle 
Out on the plains I'm just a loner
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin me a boner 

I got thoughts of Annie Oakley
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me 
And we didn't even fuck
I gave my last gold tooth 'n gold nugget to get my dick sucked 

3 days out on the frontier
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer 
I need a slut for a service
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous 

Man I gotta get my rocks off
'cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft 
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure 

[Chorus]
I'm a desperate rado
Didn't take any practice
A desperate rado

Got a cock like a cactus 
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote
Horny as a toad trippin off peyote 
Holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack

I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack 
And to the law I'm no stranger
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger 
And then Tonto tried to get down

So I boned his bitch slit he's throat and then I skipped town 
That's the way I run my show
Paint towns red
Fuck hoes and then I lay low 

I know you think I'm archaic
But my dick's like a sword
I see pussy and want to slay it 
Out on the plains it gets linely

Sometimes I feel homely
New faces
New towns no one knows me 
Guns cocked in my holster

You see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster 
I'm always lookin for the quick buck
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt 
Some say my head's hollow

Fuck em... I'm just a 

[Chorus 2]
Desperate rado
Trottin through the bad lands
A desperate rado
Tokin down with all the cowhands 
A desperate rado
Didn't take much practice
A desperate rado

Got a cock like a cactus 
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow
In any town I can be found at the local bordello 
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin, 

And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons 
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin 
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand

Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand 
I'm a low down buckaroo
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too 
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad

And morals in upbringing is something that I never had 
Known as the ruff ridin Texan
A bad buck from the day of my inception. 
And I was raised in the poor house

My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house 
Now since the day I left the corral
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal 
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside
And told me that high was the best way to ride... 

[Chorus 3]
Now I'm a desperate rado
Always lookin for a fight
A desperate rado
Puffin on a peace pipe 
I'm a desperate rado
On the run from the law
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw",Desperate-Rado
Kid Rock,"I had a realization of God, i saw God
And umm, it's not a face or a figure or anything
It was a presence, umm the woods
(all natural) God is all natural
The sun, the universe, everything
You, me were part of God, were part of God
It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me",Fred
Kid Rock,"I'm on the brink I wonder what you bitches think
Like Madonna walkin round like you ship doesn't stink 
No class jack ass bitches actin like a burro
Dressed in black head to toe thinkin you're so fuckin euro 

Tryin to act Manhattan when you're from some little village
In a Public Enemy shirt and it's all for your image 
'Cause any other rap you think it's crap fuckin trash
Bitch talk your shit just never let me get that ass

'Cause... 

[Chorus]
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind bitch
I'll fuck you blind till you just can't see no more 

Back in school I knew this chick her name was Sara Bolerdies
And she thought she was the shit becuz she dated older guys 
Dumb bitch fuckin whore always wanted to get laid
But never gave the pussy up to anybody in her grade 

Played me like a sucker
Like a bitch like a punk
That little pussy lickin finger fuckin ho ass cunt 
Never once did she speak to anybody in her class

So one day I told her never let me get that ass
'Cause... 

[Chorus]

Gettin' drunk smokin' buddha, 
Gettin' laid and gettin' played like fuckin' Amy Papuda 
Better chill with that before you kill the cat
Before you spend your fuckin' life lying on your back 

You ain't gotta let me fuck you to be liked
Get a grip, shit I'll like you just the same if you suck a good dick 
And yo I'm not speakin' to all you girls at my shows
I'm speakin' directly to all you fuckin' bitches and hoes
Huh

'Cause I love women ones who chill drink and laugh
But if your fake ho don't ever cross my mother fuckin' path",Fuck U Blind
Kid Rock,"My ideas like highs
They come and they go
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know 
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep

Someone so shallow that's in so deep 
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared
Completely blinded but things are so clear 
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother

I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father 
Fuckin' A is all I got to say
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way 
I was born into this world and I don't know why
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die",In So Deep
Kid Rock,"Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothing
Pot smokin' beer drinkin' motherfucker that's me

In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the motherfuckin midwest 'cause there's no contest
For the pimp, I'm the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education

All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killin' brain cells

The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
I go to sleep at night watchin' Kojak

Fuck hoes 'cause I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this...

People want to know what I'm thinkin' but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from the shelter but I really don't give a fuck

'cause I still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
Forties of Busch I be poundin'
I ain't dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than motherfuckin' Ted Danson

Hanson brother style when I'm rumblin'
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumblin'
Fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealin' you-hauls

I'm not into havin' clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun

Your little plan was a flop
Tryin' to get em on by sellin' out the Kid Rock

A part of me was with you but yo he died,
And I'm glad you stepped off 'cause I ain't givin' no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it motherfucker if you want it lets get the beef on

Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
'cause I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real mutha for ya

I was dealin and stealin everything in sight

I've been ramblin and gamblin since the age of 13

Working like a bitch like a god damn tank,
Some disagree because my rents had bank
But all that's gold non't always glitter,

Please God, please I'll pay any cost,
If you'd just stop the world cause I want to get off

There's too many motherfuckers tryin to get in my brain

And suckers that step willll be put to rest, yes,

I hold the key to my own success,
And suckers that step will catch a bullet in their chest,

And I'm gonna get where I'm going just hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush and I can't stand rushin,

Fussin with the girls they waste my time,
Thrashin and bashin going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics everyday,

'Cause I ain't really got that much to say
I'm a slave to the trade I'm paid to rhyme,
I don't wear a watch and I don't keep time
I live my life just like the skipper,

But only at night because I'm a day tripper
Twitchin-shakin,
And I kick more bass then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head,
And I won't stop trippin till the day I'm dead

Kid Rock,"Here here we go from Japan to Romeo
My flow is slow and it's ya know my first time on radio 
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild
And that all might be true

But it did not happen overnight
So let me tell my tale to you 
It started out when I was six just tellin' dirty jokes
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap 

Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth 
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block 

You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin it's tail
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail 
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week 

So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standin tall... 
And you don't know me
It's funny how one kid can cause so much confusion

Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using 
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story 
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at

Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back 
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style
They try to diss they shoot they miss
I walk off with a smile 

But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me
And the booty naked truth is you don't know shit about me 
So when I'm in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me
So you can see what's really me and find out you don't know me 

'cause you don't know me 
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam 
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty

With every drind 'n every blink you seem to get more pretty 
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to 
(Ha!) 

Next day I awoke I almost choked
Who's bringin me inside, 
My head was ringin' heard people singin' ""here comes the bride"" 
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see

The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me 
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN'
You don't know me...She didn't know me 

Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist
But they bought my first L.P. 
You know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast 
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie

What's your favorite song off that L.P.
""Ah, Wax that Booty"" 
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money 

But check on back 'cause it's a fact obscenity is no new thing
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real

I'll always say just what I feel 'cause that's the real Kid Rock...

Eyes open 'cause I'm scopin for a big butt slut
One that I can take straight back to my house
And have suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth

Now get, get with it looked across the street
Seen a slimmy in a skirt bopping to the beat
So I capped up my forty threw it under my seat
Rolled up on the freak and I started to speak

But before I could she go grabbed my dick
Licked her lips and started talking that porno shit
She said ""look here I know our kid rock""
Then whispered in my ear ""I want to swallow your cock""

Well blow me up then blow me down
'Cause I think I just found the biggest freak in town
And now I can't wait to get her back to my house

""you want my balls in your mouth?""

Big grin on my grill and not much to say
Except hey yo bitch how's about
I drop my drawers and put my ballis in your mouth?

Then it was like straight out of a porn
She dropped to her knees and started blowing my horn
And after that without no doubt
She opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth

Next to cutie started rubbing my back
She put her finger right between my booty crack
So I grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut
""Ain't Nobody sticking nothing in my butt""

Now right then I knew I had a ho and a half
And all that I could do is sit back and laugh
Stare at the ceiling thinking about
This chick I just met's got my balls in her mouth

[Chorus]

After I busted my nuts I drover to the cut
She said ""I hope you don't think that I'm a big slut
And please don't tell anyone what we've been through""
Next day I told the whole fucking crew

Spread the news through the whole damn town
And to that chick it must have got back around
So I told the ho sorry and tried to make amends
But she tried to fuck me in front of my  friends

Running off at the lip talking all that shit
That I'm a bitch I'm a prick and I got a small dick
I just waited til she walked away to shout

Never works says he can't find the right job

'Cause all theses corney, foney emcee's now a days don't move me

So I'm a show it proof G, so make waves

Because I'm burryin' emcee's, and sharin' their ladies
Now you rolled hoe's are carrying my babies

Grab me it never hurt no one 
A broken home always hurts someone
Grab me it never hurt no one
I saw kid's get shot, don't sell guns

And still I rip it, flip it, grip it like a real one does
Rockin', shockin' on the stage, with a hella steady buzz
From a 5th of ole Jimmy Beam
We fryin emcee's up just like some motherfuckin' Jimmy Dean

Sausage pattys, and smokin cabbies like it's no thing
Drinkin' more Colt's then the 45 king
Swingin' emcee's like a cow hands rope
And if the guns too loud, oh boy, I'm straight slittin throats

'Cause that's the way I like to do shit holmes
Every time I get my gamble on
Yeah that's the way I like to do shit holmes
I never stay in one spot, I was born to roam

Feel like I got bank, but it's not enough friend
'Cause I want more bank see, than my grandkids could ever spend
So if ya need some cheep slut, then speak up
Most hoe's know not to ask for cash, cause I'm a cheep fuck

For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of jack and the caps of meth

Kid Rock,"Black chick white guy, does it mean shit, maybe?
I don't know but yo, it never fazed me
But either way here's one tale
Of two like that and what prevailed
It started way back in the eighth grade
In the small old town where the two both stayed
He came from a family of middle class
Where everything he did he always had to ask
She came from a place that was so alone
You know the same old tale of a broken home
Her momma was an alkie and more like a friend
Had three different kids from three different men
And that's just the way shit was
Couldn't change it, couldn't rearrange it, so there it was
Anyway the two kept on
With the phone calls notes and so on and so on
And after the bullshit and whattn'
That day came the two started fuckin'
All the time, you know kids' habits
Every single day fuckin' like rabbits
Sneakin' out the car when he was fifteen
Climbin' in the window and fuckin' all night, see
Fuckin' during lunch in the junior high bathrooms
Drinking champagne and trippin' on mushrooms
His dick was metal her pussy was a magnet
Ninth grade came, I'm pregnant
Shit got frantic and man, oh, Lord
It was a tuff decision, but they decided to abort it
It might have been right it might have been wrong
But one thing's for sure it really fucked his head up
Where is it, who is it, how is it, was it right?
These are the things he thought in bed at night
A lot of people might laugh at this
But fuck, 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'

Now as time went on the the two kept on
They kept seeing each other off and on
See she moved to the city and you know what happened
Black chick with a real white accent
Pretty girl in the ghetto, go figure
Yeah, she got macked by some dope-dealin' nigga
Still seein' that other kid on the side
She kept most of her thoughts inside
See all the first guy did was just love her
While that punk mother fucker used to beat her and punch her
She was livin' all wild
I think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child
She asked the first guy to have his baby
He looked at her like she must be crazy
He was makin' records and goin' on tour
Twenty thousand people hip hoppin on the floor
And all that while she sat at home and got macked
If she stepped out of line, she got slapped
And then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away
And he did he got caught with a loaded gun
And went to jail but first she had his son
Oooh, and now what to do?
She had no man, no money and no clue
Now the other guy came back from tourin'
And she called him up early one mornin'
They hooked up her mind was blown
As he began to raise her son as his own
And that's a lot of shit to deal with, man
And if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand
And people still laugh at this shit
Fuck 'em, they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'

Now for the next year there was some good times
A few bad times mostly good times
See, he was a ramblin' man to the bone
He liked women and wine and he loved to roam
Not like she was any kind of saint
See in this story there's a lot of red paint
But time kept slippin' and made her crazy
And she talked about havin' another baby
The guy was like, ""oh Lord""
We got one now that we can't afford
But she convinced she could handle even two
Said ""I want your child or I'm leavin you""
I can't figure out why then he didn't run
I guess he was attached to her and her son
All confused about what to do
That girl met another guy and was fuckin' him too, slut
Could barely pay her rent
And then the same old shit, I'm pregrant
And if that ain't some shit 'cause
The girl didn't even know who the father was
And still by her side the first guy stayed
Head gettin' more fucked by the day
He stuck it out for nine months I don't know why
And then a little girl on the Fourth of July
Was born in the front seat of his car
It was amazing, kinda like a shooting star
He was happy, told his family and friends
Only to realize later his little girl wasn't his
And that crushed him quick
Suicidal thoughts were in his head real thick
But before he found all that out
From the same chick, another kid popped out
And that shit's real ill
Girl told him that she was takin' the fuckin' pill
She must have known all along
The little girl wasn't his and she was tryin' to latch on
Three different kids from three different men
History repeats itself again
And after some more shit got stirred
He kicked that bitch to the curb
And now from her he's got a little boy that makes him laugh a bit, huh
Huh, and he loves him
But still you don't know the fuckin' half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows, I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
I'm still standin'
I am still standin'","Black Chick, White Guy"
Kid Rock,"Cowboy, cowboy

Well, I'm packin up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped wit' scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the hills, chill like flynt
Buy an old drop-top, find a spot to pimp

Then I'ma Kid Rock-it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lotsa crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""chillin' the most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast

Give a toast to the sun
Drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix
And get tossed outta bars

Sift to Tiajuana
I want to roam
Find Motown telephones and come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of four seasons

I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes - Like dust in the wind

I once was lost (but now I'm just blind)

Palm trees and weed, scabbed knees and rice

And let Californi-A know why they call me

Rollin' sunset women with a bootle of becks
See a slimy in a 'Vette, roll down my glass
And said ""yeah this dick fits right in yo' ass""
No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor
Call me hoss, I'm the boss, with the sauce, and the horse
No remorse for the sheriff and his eye ain't right
I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white, uh!
'Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Got west-coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors, ball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us

Why they want to pick on me?
Lock me up and throw away my key
I ain't no cheat, I'm just a regular failure
I'm not straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer

Keep on truckin' 'til I fall in the ocean

To New York City and seven hundred-dollar dinners

So shut up now or put my balls in your mouth
Bet that ass, hoss, I ain't forgot
When I was tossed in the dime bin and left to rot
Used to call me funny when my nose was fucking runny
Now my fuckin' bunnies gettin' fuckin' Matchbox 20 money
Motherfuckers want to claim they're down
But when I was broke and down I never seen 'em around
All the shit we talked, all the shit we dreamed
I did it without you, I got a brand new team
No triple beams, it seems like a movie
Bought two cribs, drop-top, and jacuzzi
No more floozies, only high-class hoes
A couple when it rains and a few when it snows
A brand new nose to go along with my habit
And a garden hose made out of twenty-four karat
Bought a couple parots that like to squak
And they sound like you and all the shit you talk
Step inside my shoes, you couldn't fill em' doc
You're too old to kid, too soft to rock
I already did what most love to shout
Seven years on wax and I still ain't sold out

I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple of dollare bills still I feel the same

Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a croud
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Out stretched hands and one night stands

Still I can't find love
And when the walls are tumbling down
I will always be around
Yeah

And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home

I've been gone, I've been gone way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm

You get what you put in and people get what the deserve
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been given but just ain't gettin' I've been walkin' that thin line
So I think I'll keep a walking with my head held high

I'll keep moving on and only God knows why
Only God, only God, only God knows why
Only God knows why, why, why, why
Only God knows why

Take it to the river, hey
Take me to the river, hey",Only God Knows Why
Kid Rock,"Everything's tight from my loot to my friends
I ain't got time to tighten up loose ends huh
I've been that route too many times
If I ain't stabbed in the back I ain't fightin' no crime

I wish for that which my heart holds near
But ain't nobody playin' what I'm tryin' to hear
I've been sayin' for years that the fakes wouldn't last
You were jockin' that bullshit, now you look like an ass

Get gassed in your garage of sickness
As I bring a little swing into your world of stiffness
'Cause I've got plenty of rhymes to spill
Ain't got nothin' more than time to kill

Form like a blister, drink like a failure
Rip like a twister right through a trailer
Park after dark is when you'll see me comin'
My gun's gunnin' and the 808's hummin'

Raw Raw Rip Rock Rude
Sample anything I like and never get sued
At 18 I had a hardcore attitude
When I turned 19 I was touring with Ice Cube

It's true I broke the old school
Where the rules don't bend and the beats don't end
No place to be I gotta let these knuckles know who the fuck I be
I'm still the (I'm still body rockin' DP MC)

So clap your hands to what he's doing
I'm a razor blade slittin' through a wrist of hate
I'm a contradiction I'm a twist of fate

See me rollin'
You got me rollin'
I'm rollin'
Searchin' underneath the sun

I'm dead as shit, but I ain't been killed
See I'm a Mack, I'm a truck, but I'm Peter built
I am the Trucker and my ego's large
I'm the K to the I call me sarge

Roll number seven raise south of heaven
See my crew comin' hear them Harley's revin'
I'm steppin' to your crew with a glick of hits
Got 3 LP's but I ain't got no hits

And I'm a grateful, hateful, little son of a G
I'm a deadhead runnin' from the D-P-D
Got soul you're plagued with the rhythms cancer
Grab a bowl, you'll be swingin' like a topless dancer

Biltmore Beavers and a Top Dog Coat
Top car 4 Vogues on a hundred spokes
Got a roundtrip ticket to the promised land
If it ain't all that I'll be back my man

Rolllin'
You got me rollin'
I'm rollin'
Searching undearneath the sun

Rolllin'
You got me ro-o-o-llin'
I'm rollin'
Searching undearneath the sun

Days roll by they roll too fast
I said days roll by I watch them pass

Yeah you want to roll with Rock
And party with the crews that just don't stop uh huh

You got me rollin'
I'm rollin'

Kid Rock,"I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side
Never drop top forty cause I always rock besides
G-rides with a hundred spokes to match
We roll two deep three freaks four amps in the back

I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang
Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing
I want to twang like Hang, rock like roll
Got soul like Stevie when I'm under the sun and so

Somebody's gotta feel this

I never had a lot of money never made much sense
Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed
He's rockin' dickie's sipping, lickie slipping, honey's steady
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness

(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this

Someone's got to feel this

Someone's got to feel this

I see these people makin' money and it's funny to me
Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me
'Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more
Taste a little bit of pride from every drink that I pour
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers

Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my rope
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because

You can check my stats
And rollin' a Fleetwood that's how I mack
I rock all the tracks

So the world knows
I love all the girls
Smack all the hoes
Show love to those who come real with it

Life's a bitch but I deal with it
I'm in it to win it like Yzerman
Could drink about 15 Heinekens
I'm not born again

But if I was I'd ask to come back with a little more love
Puffin' a Winston
Drinkin' a four-o
Kid rock, and I'ma let you know

I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking trying to free my mind

It's been a couple of months in this smokey room
Eaten shrooms drinking Boones writing tunes
And hoping to get one of these mother fuckin' songs to hit

A little bit of love that's all I need
A little inspiration and a bag of weed
A seed to plant so my tree can grow
You know I left my girl 'cause I need that hold up

Wait a minute I'm about to flow
Like a breeze through the trees you can watch me blow
Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o
Kid Rock and I'm gonna let you know

I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking trying to free my mind
Oh yeah
Huh, oh yeah
Free my mind
Ooh, yeah

Come on, oh, oh,
Wow

I ain't no rough guy
Ain't no tough guy
Don't get out much and don't dress up fly
Born in the game that's all I am

Giving all my duckets to Uncle Sam
Fuck it
I'm free to do what I please little lady
I was born at night but not last night baby

I've been around, seen some things
I slept in dumpsters, got high with kings
I don't bring much, ain't gotta lot to say
But I got more time than Morris day

Puffing a Winston drinking a four-o
Kid Rock and I'm a let you know

I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking thinking trying to free my mind (free my mind)
I've been sitting here just wasting time
Drinking smoking trying to free my mind (smoking and drinking)

I'm gonna rock it for Dixie to suit your fancy
Rock your pants off and party my dick off
People want to know when's the tour gonna kick off

I'm no rip-off , it's all original
Not too political a little cynical
About the fakes and squakers that talk a lot of Ku-ca
I know a lot of chicks that like to call me poppa

Don't start drama mack in the Bahamas
Rock on the dance floor to din dada
'Cause I'm a player that you love to hate
Got your girl suckin' dick on video tape

I like pussy suckin' on titties
Fucked a lot of different bitches from a bunch of different cities
Kid Rock and I'm the same old fool
I'll tell ya to drop your boyfriend then drop outta high school

Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass
I'm so crass that I'm the last of my kind
Me, Slick Willie in the DC Shrine

Sometimes I rhyme just for kicks

Take your money then I'll tell ya get the hell out

I shot the sheriff and the deputy too
Paid off the feds now its all about my crew
What you hoes wanna do
One at a time or all at once I'll still roll through your whole crew
Like a south bound trucker
Hoss and mother fuckers take shorts mother fuckers take a loss
And when you step with your anger
I'm like the robot from lost in space (danger danger)
I give a warning but if you don't take it
I'll put my arm around your neck like we're cool then I'll break it

Here's the deal when I say clap your hands like a seal
Or better yet give respect where it's earned

You took a turn for the worst
Walked up in my face rode away in a hurse
Now how you gonna front on that

Kid Rock,"Black chick white guy
Does it mean shit maybe
I don't know but yo it never phased me
But either way here's one tail

Of two like that and what prevailed
It started way back in the 8th grade
In the small old town where the two both stayed
He came from a family of middle class

Where everything he did he always had to ask
She came from a place that was so alone
You know the same old tail of a broken home
Her momma was an alkie and more like a friend

Had three different kids from three different men
And that's just the way shit was 
Couldn't change it couldn't rearrange it so there it was
Anyway the two kept on

With the phone calls notes and so on and so on
And after the bullshit and whatten
That day came the two started fuckin'
All the time you know kids habit's

Every single day fuckin' like rabbits
Sneakin out the car when he was 15 
Climbin' in the window and fuckin' all night see
Fuckin' during lunch in the junior high bathrooms

Drinking champagne and trippin' on mushrooms
His dick was metal her pussy was a magnet
9th grade came, I'm pregnant
Shit got frantic and man oh Lord it was a tuff decision

But they decided to abort it
It might have been right it might have been wrong
But one thing's for sure it really fucked his head up
Where is it who is it how is it was it right

These are the things he thought in bed at night
A lot of people might laugh at this
But fuck 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows I'm still standin'

Now as time went on the the two kept on
They kept seeing each other off and on
See she moved to the city and you know what happened
Black chic with a real white accent

Pretty girl in the ghetto go figure
Yeah she got macked by some dope dealin' nigger
Still seein' that other kid on the side
She kept most of her thoughts inside

See all the first guy did was just love her
While that punk mother fucker used to beat her and punch her
She was livin' all wild
I think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child

She asked the first guy to have his baby
He looked at her like she must be crazy
He was makin' records and goin' on tour
20,000 people hip hoppin on the floor

And all that while she sat at home and got macked
If she stepped out of line she got slapped
And then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away
And he did he got caught with a loaded gun

And went to jail but first she had his son
Ooohh and now what to do
She had no man no money and no clue
Now the other guy came back from tourin'

And she called him up early one mornin'
They hooked up her mind was blown
As he began to raise her son as his own
And that's a lot of shit to deal with man

And if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand
And people still laugh at this shit
Fuck 'em they don't know the half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore
I have taken my blows I'm still standin'

Now for the next year there was some good times
A few bad times mostly good times
See he was a ramblin' man to the bone
He liked women and wine and he loved to roam

Not like she was any kind of Saint
See in this story there's a lot of red paint
But time kept slippin' and made her crazy
And she talked about havin' another baby

The guy was like Oooh Lord
We got one now that we can't afford
But she convinced she could handle two
Said I want your child or I'm leavin you

I can't figure out why then he didn't run
I guess he was attached to her and her son
All confused about what to do
That girl met another guy and was fuckin' him too slut

Could barely pay her rent
And then the same old shit, I'm pregrant
And if that ain't some shit 'cause
The girl didn't even know who the father was

And still by her side the first guy stayed
Head gettin' more fucked by the day
He stuck it out for nine months I don't know why
And then a little girl on the Fourth of July

Was born in the front seat of his car
It was amazing
Kinda like a shooting star
He was happy told his family and friends

Only to realize later his little girl wasn't his
And that crushed him quick
Suicidal thoughts were in his head real thick
But before he found all that out

From the same chic another kid popped out
And that shit's real ill
Girl told him that she was takin' the fuckin' pill
She must have known all along

The little girl wasn't his and she was tryin' to latch on
Three different kids from three different men
History repeats itself again
And after some more shit got stirred

He kicked that bitch to the curb
And now from her he's got a little boy that makes him laugh a bit
And he loves him
But still you don't know the fuckin' half of it

Ain't no sunshine when you're low
I'm low
People tell me life's a game I'm not playin'
Bitches don't mean shit to me anymore

I have taken my blows I'm still standin'

But somehow I always find myself in 'em

I'm a hidden gem, a rollin' stone
I'm a one man band with a microphone
Here to make you shake and move your body
So come on in and welcome to the party

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing but a party hey
From the early evening to the break of day
So step this way and let your mind be free
And by the way welcome to the party

Uh uh excuse me Mr. Kid Rock can I do my thing Can I have a
little something to say right here
""Oh yeah go ahead baby""

I'm a real live show and you can watch me throw
I'm the M to the L and I'll let ya know
Alize is too sweet and it'll make ya fat
I've got a pound of dank and a gallon of Kognack

I'm all of that and a bag of chips
I'm the whole damn party mix
I'm the chick that doesn't seem all too classy
You can't party with me but you can kiss my *Whistle*

[Chorus]

Hey Grandmaster 5 that old school shit's fresh
But uh let's rock some of that fuckin' 1998 Kid Rock shit bro

I'm an Irish lad, but don't call me Clancy
I'm gonna rock it for Dixie to suit your fancy
Rock your pants off and party my dick off
People want to know when's the tour gonna kick off

I'm no rip-off , it?s all original
Not too political...a little cynical
About the fakes and squakers that talk a lot of Ku-ca
I know a lot of chicks that like to call me poppa

Don't start drama...mack in the bahamas
Rock on the dance floor to din dada
'Cause I'm a player that you love to hate
Got your girl suckin' dick on video tape

I like pussy...suckin' on titties
Fucked a lot of different bitches from a bunch of different cities
Kid Rock and I'm the same old fool
I'll tell ya to drop your boyfriend then drop outta high school

I got a whirlpool...don't even ask
Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass
I'm so crass that I'm the last of my kind
Me, Slick Willie in the DC Shrine

Sometimes I rhyme just for kicks
Forget the bullshit and bust like this
I don't steal from the rich and give to the poor
I take from my bitches from give it to my whores

What up I'm saying everybody
You get fucked up and i'll rock the party

Rock the party [Repeat: x 8]",Welcome 2 the Party (Ode to the Old School)

And this is for the questions that don't have an answer
The midnight glances
And the topless dancers
The can of freaks

Cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's
And the chicks with beepers
The northern lights

And the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cities
And all my heroes at the methodone clinics

All you bastards at the I.R.S.
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress

All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

[Chorus]

For the time bombs clicking and the heads they hang
All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang  - bang
Wild mustangs
The porno flicks

All my homies in the county in cell block six
The grits when there ain't enough eggs to cook
And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun

Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

Kid Rock,"Yeah! and I've set up and turned out this state
With my own two hands
We've traveled this land packed tight in minivans
And all this for the fans, girls, money, and fame

I play their game, and then they scream my name
I will show no shame, I live and die for this
If I come off soft, then chew on this
Are you scared?

Devil without cause, and I'm back
With the Beaver hat and Ben Davis slacks
30-pack of Stroh's, 30-pack of hoes
No rogaine in the propane flows

Chosen one, I'm the living proof
With the gift of gab from the city of truth
I jabbed and stabbed and knocked critics back
And I did not stutter

When I said that I'm goin platinum, sellin rhymes
I went platinum, seven times
And still they ill they want to see us fry
I guess because of only God knows why why why why why

Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey, hey
I'm giving back so say hey, hey
Show me some metal and say hey, hey, hey, hey

I like AC/DC and ZZ Top
Bocephus, Beasties, and the Kings of Rock
Skynyrd, Seger, Limp, Korn, the Stones
David Allen Coe, and No Show Jones

Yeah! Pass that bottle around
Got the rock from Detroit and soul from Motown
The underground stoned fuckin pimp
With tracks that mack and slap back the whack

Never get in the way, I don't play with with that
But watch me rock with Liberace flash
Punk rock the Clash, Boy Bands are trash
I like Johnny Cash and Grandmaster Flash

Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey
Let me hear where you're at and say hey, hey

Jumping around on stage like a bunch of wounded ducks
When you gunna learn sucker?
You just can't fuck with Twisted Brown
Trucker

I'm an American Bad Ass
Watch me kick, you can roll with Rock
Or you can suck my dick
I'm a porno flick, I'm like Amazing Grace

I'm gunna fuck some hoes after I rock this place
Superfly living doublewide
Side car on my Glide so Joe see can ride
Full sack to share, bringin' flash and flair

Got the long hair swinging, middle finger in the air
Snake skin suits, 65 Chevelle
See me ride in sin hear the rebel yell
I won't live to tell, so if you do

Give the next generation a big 'fuck you'
Who knew I'd blow up like Oklahoma
Said fuck high school, pissed on my diploma
Smell the aroma, check my hits
I know it stinks in here, cause I'm the Shit

Oh, they call me cowboy, I'm the singer in black
Throw me the finger in the air, let me see where you're at
And say hey, hey

Kid Rock,"I want to go back
I want to go back
Uh 'cause I remember way back when
Got kicked out the crib and had a place to stay

In the Clem with some friends George and Jay
It was a funky fresh crew and I'd DJ
What a shock it was to be on the set
Comin' from a nice home now livin' in the projects

No regrets cause I learned a lot
And I earned a lot in the parking lot
Doin' dirt for the O.G's slangin' rock
They used to call me that little white kid

Who could rock on the two turntables
And that ain't no fable
Watchin' Eddie Murphy instead of Clark Gable
My whole life style switched Hoss

Puttin' in hours at the 76 car wash
But I could never wait for them weekends to come
Dumb ditty dumb ditty ditty dumb dumb
Boom, boom, the bass went

On turntables fuckin' it up in Duke's basement
Groove time productions, we kept the jam jumpin'
Open up your ears I'm tryin' to tell you somethin'
And give some love back to those that loved me

206 Court street and my second mom Tracy
Little Keesha and Cole
My mellow blow, and my homegirl Flo
Rock round see, you could find me some

But I kept my tables in the crib when I wasn't in the club
Tom Whit and Mike Shafer used to give me rides
And buy me groceries when I didn't have no paper
And I'm grateful for this

Sometimes I look back and it's these times I miss
Making demos on my old four track

Sometimes I can't help but think, I want to Go Back
I want to Go Back...back in the time
I want to Go Back 
I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time

I got kicked out again for bein fly
Got invited to stay with Tony and Eli
And they treated me like brothers
R-I-P to their cool ass mother

An my brother din dada
For the homies ain't here I still gotta lot of love
I want to go back, way back
And change things and bring y'all back

I'm pourin beer out for y'all
I'm singin I saw the light from my cousin Paul
Life brings a lot of tragedy
I look around at times and its so sad to see

A wasted life, or a broken home
But all I can do is take care of my own
I feel so alone like a stranger
And sometimes I express my love through my anger

And I lost a lot of friends for this
Blackman, T-Bone, Ernest KDC, and Chris
And the rest of the Beast crew
I ain't sayin that I'm wrong, but I still got love for you

'Cause I remember how it used to be
Make way motherfuckers beast crew's in the party
To the right, to the left
Many black men and Funk Daddy Def Stef

And sometimes I feel blessed for sure
To a been a part of one of raps last great tours
Ice Cube, Too Short, D-Nice, yo yo
Kid Rock and it don't stop

I want to Go Back...back in the time
I want to Go Back 
I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time

I remember litte Robert, cause I stayed with him
I used ta go and see Campbell, when I need a trim
And when times got grim and seen that I lost my way
I used to get blown of with Reve

Bumpin' shoulders and slappin' hands
Willie Knight had a disco, right in his basement man
Them New Haven jams
Me and Blackman running crazy scams

Not a black or white thing, a wrong or right thing
Just makin' that money, and pullin them honies
Spandex shorts and the halter tops
Slanging them rocks and runnin from the cops

The only white kid walkin' round on the block
Cruisin' in Amp's low ridin' ragtop
Go see Howard for what ya need
Underage buyin forties and bags of weed

Late night liquor from Bubba Coles
People used to say, Rock you got soul
Vince looked out and so did Lou
Had a studio budget from the cocaine loot

Chuck D and Murph were the original three
And now Richard D and Kracker are down with me
I got a studio record and a taste of fame
But when I roll through the Clem it's all the same

Even though things change, you know I ain't forgot
'Cause the love from the past gave birth to Kid Rock
But it's hard to go back to the things I knew
'Cause tha me life a have now lives for two

Yeah, and that's where I'm at
I want to Go Back...back in the time
And that's where I'm at

I want to Go Back...go way back way back y'all
I want to Go Back...back in the time
Bring it down
Way
Hey

Let it ride, let it ride
Hey... Hey
Way back, way back y'all",I Wanna Go Back

Kid Rock,"Oooooooo Yeahhhhhh
And while your out gang bangin
Tring to catch a murder case
Your hoes on my couch gettin fucked in the face

Bumpin to the base of some old school rap jam
This ain't tennis, but yo I'll use my backhand
On any grown man that tries to check rock
I want to head bang, I gotta hip hop

'Cause I'm gonna stick with what got me paid
Lickin that coochie with the high top fade
I'm self made like Henry Ford
I'm on this mic but it feels like I been here before

I want more than the next man
Respect, plus to cash big checks
And mack on hoes like Ruddy Ray
'Cause the reach around just sounds so gay

I don't even swing that way
I told you hoes before I'm the K
I to the D are O see K'n, rhymes sayin, guitar playin
Turntable spinnin at a basement jam

No fame, no money, but you wouldn't understand
What it's like to be so real
You got the beats and the rhymes, but you ain't got no feel
I don't need the fancy music to make mine

Just the beat and the funky ass base line
Drop a couple cuts on the track
A tracks to the mother fuckin wack
So while your making record that don't recoup
I'm in the house gettin paid like Snoop

Kid Rock an' I got all the hoes sayin'
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby
Fuck me baby, fuck me 'till the break of dawn

I want my khakis washed, starched, and creased 
I want an order of fries with a side of grease
I wish for peace throughout this land
I want the whole fuckin world in my hands

I want a band like the US Funk Mob
See I can rap I don't hafta lay sod, just to make ends meet
October 31st yellin Trick-or-Treat
Boy aren't you a little old to be trickin

You see my mask and bag bitch, I ain't bullshittin
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub
I'm kinda anal, cause I ain't no fuckin slob
I'm the cradle that's able to rock any format

But still I'm labeled and treated like a doormat
Where's the whores at?
Westside hoes like cars, so I ride em for a test drive
I'm like a pringle, I won't go soft

I got a new jingle, I'm about to go off
Hey ho, check it out, I really like to turn you out
And if you be good to me,
I'll yoodle in your valley

Kid Rock ain't nothing nice
Got the salt and pork boomin with the beans and rice
Got a head full of lice cause I'm such a scum
Got a pocket full of money, but I'm dressed like a bum

Got a business mind, so if I loose the funk,
I'll still be in the house gettin paid like trump

'Cause I got the juice to spruce and get nice and
So enticing strong like a bison 
Ruff like brandy and no one knows

Smash, slash and when I trash I bash
I get ill I chill but you don't know the half 
I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick

I'm nothin' but a funky country hick 
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump 
Never been questioned by the F.B.I

Although I've tried every method just to get high 
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin' on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin' on 
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin' on

But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin' on 
Down to the mother fuckin' A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem 
No brain no pain... Now see'mon why'all and tell me what's my name

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin' 
Taggin' hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock 

I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you 
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio want to get rich ho 

So count my props you can't get with me and fuck all you cops you ain't shit to me 
But hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one 
And for anyone tryin' to bust me up

You better chill with that tryin' to fuck me up 
And if you're talkin' shit I'm gonna shut ya up
And all ya wack D.J.'s I'm gonna cut ya up 
'Cause I don't give a fuck about no one

And when I wax I tax and that's just how it goes son 
Yo ain't no sucker
'Cause I'm the kid..""rock mother fucker"" 
Straight from Mo-town and I won't slow down

I cease the cheese M.C,'s I moe down 
And I show no shame 'cause I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name 
It ain't Eric Clapton and this ain't slowhand

I was born to be a hick

I think she took off with another man 
I been around the world looking twice 

You know I checked in New York City 
On the streets and on the subways 
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me 
I looked out in the Hamptons thought she'd be hangin' with them rich folks 
But no she wasn't anywhere hangin' on the east coast 

I wish my baby come home 
I want my baby come home 
I wish my baby come home 
I want my baby yeah my baby to come back home 
Man you know I love that girl 

I checked down to the Southern plains from Alabama to Georgia 
Honey if you hear this, please know I'm looking for ya 
I checked with all my rebel friends 
I've looked around for weeks 
And I swear until I find her I won't eat and I won't sleep 

I want my baby come home 
I want my baby come home 
I want my baby come home 
I wish my baby yeah my baby would come back home 

I went from Albuquerque to Maine and didn't find a damn thing 
So I looked in California - up and down the coast 
I looked all over Hollywood - it wasn't even close 
Never found nothin' 
So, I came home, home to Detroit City 
And there she was sittin' on my porch - My baby looked so pretty

Got used
Smoked Dope
Paid Dues
Refused

To give up quick
Now there's 10 Million Motherfuckers on my dick
Sold what
Say how

Say who
Fuck what
Fuck me
Fuck you

Come clean
You know I will drink a fifth of Jim Beam
And still stand still
I'm the illest fool

Cooler than the water in a swimming pool
Fly like a seagull kickin' like a mule
More jams than a Beatle from Liverpool
I deliver fool

No who the fuck are you
I'm Kid motherfuckin' Rock from the old school
Got more money than Matchbox 20
Get more ass than Mark McGrath

They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up

I'm from the outskirts of Detroit Rock City
A-Shirts,Cadillacs,Big titties
Skinny models you can keep those
I like big corn fed Midwestern ho's

Don't you know
Talk fast
Pimp slow
Show up to black ties in t-shirts & slippers

Sippin' liquor, fuck models love strippers
known as the big tipper with the big dipper
I got queens holding keys to my zipper
Fuck a real good girl

I've got the baddest bitch in the world

They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up

You think you got it good in Hollywood
I got acres of land laid back in the woods
Holdin' shares cool like Fonzie
Rollin' Lake St. Clair in my forty foot Donzie

You got a Bentley Wow
I got jets with wet bars
And trucks with gold plows
Bitch bow when I pimp through

For the Kid, the Rock the Red, White and Blue
Who knew the Kid would be
Everything from old George Jones to Jay-Z
Baby I'm sick of getting ripped off

So pissed about to be pissed off
Mackin' me coz you know I'm payed
that's why I'm slappin' my gardners,and fuckin' my maids
Never mind my age but if we're taking numbers
Fifteen million sold motherfucker

They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up
They say I'm cocky and I say what
It ain't braggin' motherfucker if you back it up

But the money and the problems and the women keep me away 
I want to be happy for just one hour, but the only time I'm happy 
Anymore is on the stage

I don't care if tomorrow never comes

Wit the funky hot wrists, thick like Al Rocker
Pumpin out hits, gettin chips like Opera
Bitch I told ya, do not hate
Or question the music I make, ugh

I make PUNK ROCK, and I mix it wit the HIP-HOP
I getcha higher than a TREE TOP

The junky's are, still cigar smokin
Still the same cause I ain't change nuttin

All in check doin the redneck boogie

The king is back, to retract the wack
Re-pack my sack, wit the double fat back
Forget all that, I'm still singin (yeeaah!)
And like kids on monkey bars I'm still swingin

Thought I got dusty, thought I'd get rusty
Thought I'd get rich and quit, oh he must be
Fat and ugly, broke black and blue

The legible, credible, inevitable storm
Way past the norm', still misbehavin

Don't come, don't test the boss
Cause I got this sewn like Betsy Ross
You can floss and front, you can taunt and tease
But you can't fuck wit rhymes like these

Thumpin like a drum kit wit wrists that slit picks
Bumpin for the kids who twist, splif and sips fifth
I got the gift I'm about to unravel

You ought a point your finger at the mirror

I have been there
Unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise
I've realized one thing, how much I love you
And it hurts to see, see you cryin'
I believe we can make it through the winds of change

God is great indeed
If you believe, in the everlife
Yeah we gotta
Make some sense of the piece that's not defined
And if you just hold on, I won't let ya fall
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change

Though I walk through the valley of darkness
I am not afraid
'Cause I know I'm not alone

And if the wind blows east, would you follow me
And if the wind blows north, would ya stay your course
And if the wind blows west, would ya second guess
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be
And walk this road through life with me
You know I love youuuuuu

On this lonely road of faith
On this lonely road of faith",Lonely Road of Faith
Kid Rock,"I was hiding from the sun once again
I was running from time my friend
I've lost another war
So I poured one more, and went home drunk again

She was up when the key hit the lock
And the clock looked at me just like the devil in disguise
I saw it in her eyes
She'd be gone before the evening

So I poured another strong one
And chopped a line from here to Texas
'Cause I've lost another good one
She's on the midnight train to Memphis

With a brand new start
I swore I'd love from the heart
I meant to change my ways
But I've seen better days

Than the one that's here this morning, mmhm
With a wife and kids at home
With a job somewhere on some assembly line
I wish I had that life
I bet you wish you had mine

So I poured another tall one
And chopped a line from here to Texas
'Cause I've lost another good one
She's on the midnight train to Memphis

Dude, what station is this, K snooze
Kid Rock, I thought he was the American bad ass
He's putting me to sleep
Nudge me if he gets over five decibels
I knew his first album was the good one

But that's the way I am, and this is how I jam
All across the land from Alabam' to bandstand
Doped up rebel with an attitude, shit
So fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch, fuck a bitch

I won't switch, won't quit no vices
Flip the script cause I'm a slice the righteous
Haven't you heard I don't refrain
Free as a bird, and so I won't change

Livin' it up, givin' it up, fuckin' shit up, what
I'm a run the track from the D to Nantucket
So fuck it, if you don't dig that you can suck it
Yeah, and it don't, and it don't

With an old suitcase, I swear I'll leave this place
I'll get you back in time, can't drink you off my mind
So I'll see you when I'm sober
I been looking for some reasons
But I ain't found one down in Texas
I been changing with the seasons
Walked in a new line back to Memphis",Midnight Train to Memphis
Kid Rock,"Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fuelling up on cocaine and whisky
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Oh Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Fueling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you been
I can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him
I saw ya yesterday with an old friend

I saw you yesterday with an old friend

It was the same old same how have you been

Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

You reminded me of brighter days

I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

I was off to drink you away

I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home
I just called to say I love you

I've been on the cover of the rolling stone
I met the president when I was half stoned
I been so high I've gotten confused
I been beat down, broke and used
Motherf***er
I drank with hank, talked blues with billy
Rocked with run sang with shotgun willy
Went from small time philly to big time bobby
From 3 day old chili to saki with wosabi

I'm home hey I'm home
You never met a motherf***er quite like me
Not like me, dida dada like me, hey like me

No more bein' poured drink specials at winners
Or being ignored by the think straight sinners
I used to smoke pinners while my moms made dinner
Now I smoke bombs and rock with lynyrd skynyrd
No beginners here I'm a seasoned vet
Educated on jazz by my man amed
Heard again my friend I been the world n back
But I'm michigan boy can you feel that

And I'm home
You never met a motherf***er quite like me
Not like me, god damn like me, hey hey like me

Never thought I'd go as far in life as this
Never made par and I could give 2 s***s
Never wanted sell cars cause my dad was a dick
Never wanted a guitar 'till I heard a lick like this

And from the depths of dixie to my northern spots
You know its time to rock when ole glory drops

I pimp through town with the top laid back
Black hat, fine blonde, cold pabst in my lap
I'll adapt
To any and all situations
Thats why the call me the pimp of the nation
Hey b**** you best believe I live in the woods not your world of greed
Might, a little weed might a little yeah
I'm so proud to be living in the usa

You've never met a motherf***er quite like me
Hey hey like me, da di da da stay like me, hey hey hey like me
You aint ever met and you aint never going meet

Said I was just a wanna be

And hide away

And its a long way on a they say highway

A lonesome freeway of uncut my way
Can you feel me comin
I'm tombstone ugly and if you judge me

Hung in the crack hoods

Here I stand like jesus

I don't need this
Fuck you ho's can squeeze this
I can't believe this
I'm so wasted

From all the fruits of life
That I've tasted
Never a clone on the microphone
I got shit built up

'Cause I never felt loved at home
And all alones how I spend my free time
Writin' freal rhymes
Drinkin' cheap wine

Easy whips
And a cracker
I'm the master blaster
No one cuts faster

Is who I am ho
And I'll be rippin the fuckin ryhmes

Should I pack my pride and face this life alone

Another lonely night, another empty glass
This path I'm walking always seems to lead nowhere
I wonder how much you think of me
How we used to laugh, how we used to be
It seems like freedom has never had a man so scared

Times might change, love it comes and goes
How I wish I could have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might seem crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you
Hey I'd do it for you

I wonder how much you think of me
It hurts to think the past is all that you can see
Now it seems like freedom is better then the love we shared

Times they change, love it comes and goes
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes
And I know this might sound crazy, I would end my life for you
You know I don't want to, but I'd do it for you
Yeah, I'd do it for you

Listen to me
I wonder how long it takes to see
There's nothing more I want than you here with me
Freedom's been knocking, but I refuse to let her in

Times they change, love it comes and goes
How I wished I would have shown you how deep for you my love goes

The redneck originator, rollin' in my pick up
Truck jacked up with the four gold shocks
And where I come from mud flaps come stock

People Kid Rock it up and down the block
And the hens all flock to the coup with the cock
You want to rock with me baby, row it down to the swamp
Dock your boat, we'll do the hillbilly stomp

Do it, hi-ho
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho, haha

I like stuckies, truckers and big mesh hats
I like large round women in laundromats
I like to wander jack like a backwards thug
And watch the moonshine through the bottom of a jug

Hugging and kissing with my vision all blurry
Sifting through this world of worry
Hurry up with love, please, God bless
I don't do drugs anymore or any less

I didn't start this mess on this planet
Stop looking at me like a bandit
I've been chilling down at the swamp
With the folks that want to do the hillbilly stomp

Do it, hi-ho
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho

Now people want to know how to do this dance
Life your legs in the air like you wet your pants
Plant your hands on the top of your butt
And stomp around the woods like you're all fucked up

Circle up the trucks, fire up the brush
Untuck your shirt, we're gonna kick some dust
Don't two plus two it or three plus three it
Four by four and to a place that's scenic

Heat it up like some hot ham hocks cooking
And hop to the spot where the cops ain't looking
Bring your whole flock, go on down to the swamp
And we can rock all night doing the hillbilly stomp

Do it, hi-ho
We'll do the hillbilly stomp, hi-ho",Hillbilly Stomp

A Montana storm, or warm Kentucky rain

Have you risen above all that leads to hate

I am everything that Hollywood wants to be
I am Southern rock n roll, country and hip-hop and soul

Its been a day and a half
And I'm still high

And I feel like Jackson Mississippi
A river runnin'
Like Jackson Mississippi
A river runnin' 
Like Jackson Mississippi
A river runnin through my viens

And when the daylight disappeared
I took a good look inside
Behind my pride
I sat down and cried

I know I'm not a fool
But I don't know what's wrong
Maybe its time to pack
And just move on

And I could say I'm trying to change
But that would just be a lie

Kid Rock,"15 years on this lonely road
I paid my own way
I carried my own load
I never ask too much from no one

I was much too proud
All I ever wanted
Was to play my music for a sold out crowd
Bitches money fame

They say I had it all
6 foot 1
I walked around like I was 10 feet tall
Did you see me shine

Where the hell were you now
Detroit City back in '99
Stoned out of my mind
On that rock n' roll pain train

I had to slow things down
I live out in the woods now
It helps me keep my feet on the ground
Life's been good to me so far

Hope it's been kind to you
Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you
Now I've been rollin' on love and lust

I ride around on this million dollar bus
But this bus is just a bus man
I can't sleep at night
Man I miss my babies

And I'd really like to fuck my wife
But she ain't here tonight
On that rock n' roll pain train
After the lights go down

I live out in the woods now
It helps me keep my feet on the ground
Life's been good to me so far
Hope it's been kind to you

Stand strong in the storms of life
The sun will always shine on you
I've seen this train wreck
Time and time again

I felt It's pain
I've seen it take my friends
You've got to stop and take a look man
Or life will pass you by

Get you a guitar and a good song
That's all you really need to ride
On that rock n' roll pain train
I can't slow it down

The music and the whiskey
Don't it make you want to get loud
Life's been good to me so far
Hope It's been kind to you

And I won't have him no more
Some things I just find
Too hard to explain

So we go to mcdonalds
Or I buy him a train
And we go put it together
On the living room floor

Such is the life
Of a single father
He says daddy explain
If it's not too much bother

While its just you and me
Living here in this home
I don't understand it
And neither does he

Why there's just two
When there should be three of us
Sharing this moment

Kid Rock,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Can you forgive someone or will u hold a grudge?

Without that someone else to take the wheel

And as we sit free and well
Another soldier has to yell
Tell my wife and children I love them in his last breath

c'mon now amen, amen, amen

Habitual offenders, scumbag lawyers with agendas
I'll tell you sometimes people I don't know what's worse
Natural disasters or these wolves in sheep clothes pastors
Now damn it I'm scared to send my children to church
And how can we seek salvation when our nations race relations
Got me feeling guilty of being white
But faith in human nature, our creator and our savior, I'm no saint
But I believe in what is right

c'mon now amen, amen
I said amen, amen

Stop pointing fingers and take some blame,
Pull your future away from the flame
Open up your mind and start to live
Stop short changing your neighbors
Living off hand outs and favors, and maybe
Give a little bit more than you got to give

Simplify, testify, identify, rectify
And if I get high stop being so uptight
It's only human nature and I am not a stranger
So baby won't you stay with me tonight

It's a matter of salvation from them patience up above,
So don't give up so damn easy on the one you love, one you love
Somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew
Just dying to be with you
You know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you
So just hold on 'cause you know it's true
And if you can take the pain
And you can withstand anything, and one day
Stand hand in hand with the truth

I said amen, I said amen
I said amen, I said amen,

Amen-

Or in Detroit City's unforgotten wheels
It's the same song spinning but the same song's always been true

And I'm gonna take my roll 'cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
And I'm gonna save your soul if it's really what you want me to do

[Repeat chorus]

Get on your knees

I'm your rock n roll Jesus
",Rock N Roll Jesus
Kid Rock,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Chorus]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

[Chorus: x 2]

Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long",All Summer Long [Radio Edit]
Kid Rock,"You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were
We wouldn't be in this place tonight

Lost and lonely, scared and confused
We both have a past, nothing to lose, tonight
Well, it cuts like a knife these bad luck blues
We both got scars from the hell we been through
Somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide

Reconnected, feelin' no pain
Seeking shelter like a spark in the rain, tonight (ooh yeah)
Worn and weathered, scared to go home
We're here together, but still all alone, tonight (uh uh yeah)
And there's no need to lie, we've both been abused
The love and the pain
Cocaine and booze, now
Most people don't, but some people do

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life
Tonight, hold on tight, as we collide
As we collide
As we collide

So let's roll the dice, one more time
Take a chance on love again tonight
Risk it all, lay it on the line
Let the skeletons fight for life

Kid Rock,"Fast, on a rough road riding
High, through the mountains climbing
Twisting, turning further from my home.
Young, like a new moon rising
Fierce, through the rain and lightning
Wandering out into this great unknown.

And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'
If I don't survive

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Free, like a river raging
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.
Chasing dreams and racing father time.
Deep like the grandest canyon,
Wild like an untamed stallion.
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.

You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you can't keep no chains on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down
Deep into my eyes.

I was born free!

Hey yaya yayaya
Oh hoo

Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.

Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set

And when its done believe that
I will yell it from that mountain high

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

And I will vow to the shining seas
And celebrate God's Grace on me.

I was born free
I was born free
I was born free
Born Free

Oh, oh oh oh wah hoo",Born Free
Kid Rock,"Day by day, my life gets colder
My eyes grows thin as I get older
Peace in pieces, bloody and bruised
I feel so helpless and confused

'Cause I hear
Screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life

'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
Well, I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

Ooh yeah
Oh

I pray and pray for life's salvation
Faith is tried and true in tribulation
Love is lost and lonely, check the news
And with these open arms I'll wait for you

'Cause I hear you
Screaming on the left
Yelling on the right
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life

'Cause I can't stop the war

I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
Well, I can't change the world and make things fair
The least that I can do
The least that I can do
The least that I can do is care

For the life of me
I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me
All you see is a felon
I know God can see what's right in me
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place
When the worst case scenario is my birth place
I'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate
Take my life lesson, convincing the adolescents there's a God up in heaven
Sending down blessings
And your future ain't brighter than your present, quit stressing

Screaming on the left
And yelling on the right
While I'm sitting in the middle
Trying to live my life

'Cause I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
Well, I can't change the world and make things fair
(Yeah, I wish I could though)
The least that I can do is care

No, I can't stop the war
Shelter homeless, feed the poor
I can't walk on water
I can't save your sons and daughters
Well, I can't change the world and make things fair (no no no no)
(I wish I could though)
The least that I can do (is what I can do)
The least that I can do (I take with what I can do)
The least that I can do
Is to always care
Yes I can care
And you know I can care
Yes I can care
Is what you can do",Care

Time was on our side
Holes in our jeans and a pocket full of dreams
The future was Friday night
And we would hangout down by the river bend
Singing our favorite songs
Laughin and drinkin, smokin and smilin
Now those days are gone
Now when it rains, it pours
Wish I didn't know now the things I never knew before

Wish I didn't know now the things I know for shore

Underneath the cold fall moon

Found success but lost his patience

Kid Rock,"I feel world is cheatin'
My heart is barely beatin'
Like alone wolf in the pack

No one to believe in
Tryin' to fight these demons
Where I'm going's where I'm at

Like high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul

I've been a man of reason
Only to end up even
I've paid the price of givin' back

Low down and double dealing
Up on the mountain kneeling
I fell your love is just a trap

Like high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Siftin' though the devil's pot o' gold
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul
Rebel soul

I feel just like I'm trapped by nighttime
I sleep with one eye open in the day
I've walked the wrong way but I've walked a long way

Hey, rebel soul

Touched by the hand of treason
I'm through with not believin'
I'm leavin' town my bags are packed

And if you feel the need when
You finally find your feelings
You'll know just where to find me at

With high plains drifters
And midnight misters
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll
Dirt poor playboys
And drug store cowboys
Hey, rebel soul

Oh, rebel soul

Kid Rock,"I can’t sing like Marvin Gaye no
I can’t play that grand piano
I never was at the top of my class
I never threw no touchdown pass
All I got's cut glass to stand on
'Cause I never planned on getting my hands on
No kind of cash or woman like you
That could last a whole life through
But now that you’re here
It seems so clear

Now I ain't got no southern mansion
And I ain't much good at slow dancing
I never swam the English channel
People they say I’m hard to handle
'Cause I’m like a candle in the wind
Where you end's where I begin
And I’ll never win 'cause I’m good at losing
But thank the Lord I’m good at choosing
'Cause now that we’re here
It seems so clear

When the lights go down and the music plays
I feel like a king that can sing for days
I know some times that we don’t always agree (We don’t always agree)
They scream for more and the more I give
It takes a toll on the way we live
Please forgive me baby and try and see (Try and see)
Yeah try and see
Please try and see
But you get the best of me
(Ooh, you get the best of me)

Now I didn’t make no reservations
And I didn’t plan no great vacation
'Cause I’ve been chasing raindrops falling
Running from love when it keeps calling
And I know you think I’m just playing the field
But let me show you girl what’s real
'Cause I’m all in like a crazy gambler

Talk about religion and playing the odds

Kid Rock,"It’s the simple things in life
But life ain’t so simple right
And times get hard and people can make you mad
But I remember when I was young
I couldn’t wait to turn 21
Sit in the backyard sun and drink beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking my guitar and grinning

We’d hem and haw, we’d cuss and fight
But that’s where I learned life’s best advice
We’d talk about when I was young and bad
Sometimes he’d make me fightin’ mad
Best education I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

Nowadays most things have changed
This whole world is heading down the drain
There’s no God in schools
Toting guns is the latest fad
A little discipline would sure be nice
A little lesson in wrong and right
Maybe it’s time young man to have a beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking my guitar and singing

I’d play him songs all through the night
I’d praise the Lord I saw the light
We’d stay up late and make mom mad
But half the time we’d just laugh and laugh
Some of the best times I ever had
Was out there on the back porch drinking beer with dad

Now son I’m so damn proud of you
And the young man you’ve turned into
You’re the best son a father could ever have
And though your grandpa’s done past on
Soon you’ll be 21
So come on the back porch son and have a beer with dad

Drinking beer with dad
Out there on the back porch swinging
Drinking beer with dad
Picking our guitars and grinning

We’ll hem and haw, we’ll cuss and fight
But I’ll pass along life’s best advice
We’ll talk about your old granddad
The things he gave us he never had
I wish forever our time could last
I wish this world wouldn’t move so fast

Kid Rock,"I remember waiting for the school bus
Jenny Clayton was my first crush
And neither one of us had a clue

An old Cheyenne it was my first truck
Rusted, rough and kinda beat up
But when she jumped in it felt brand new

And now these days when I drive through a small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down
’cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those days that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend
An old Chevy and a couple friends
Oh how I wish that I could go back in time
Just to love you again

I remember drinking from the same cup
We’d break up just to make up
I remember falling in love with you
Smokin’ cigarettes on the tailgate
Man it seems like it was yesterday
When Main Street felt like Park Avenue

And when I’m driving through any ol’ small town
I turn my stereo up and roll my windows down
’cause it reminds me of my first kiss
And those times that I always miss
Tom Petty on the radio
Going steady with nowhere to go
No money just time to spend

Everything I try you hate it
So baby why don’t you just fuck off and die

I heard that you been speaking softly
Trying to toss my good name under the bus, bus, bus
Creeping ‘round with everybody

Lickin' pussy underwater shootin' bubbles up your ass

Sunshine and joy always nigh;

Helping a fellow along,

One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling

Kid Thomas,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

The moonlight and you
Give me a June night

He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye

Yo, I'll solve it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

This is where I long to be

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

I'm rooted to my shore

Here as I see the friends I thought I made
A little bit crazy to know by now
We've outgrown one another

Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Now when I see the things I want
I can take the things I see
But I keep asking myself why
And if there ain't just a little bit more for me
Here when it's time to count the cost
I keep measuring what I've lost
And wondering if you knew
It would all end up with you

Here as I watch the time go by
How I'd like to sail away
Leaving all my past behind
But I know I'd only last for a couple of days
Here stands everything I thought I made
It's the only life I know
And I can't even call it my own
I've got no hope, I belong to you

No tricks no gimmicks, I be stomping down down down down down demons
Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree, the upper class hate
Middle don't exist, the bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumping on a fad, laying in a ditch
I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on

The police don't come around these parts
They tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on

Black folks grieving, headlines reading
Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight

Damn, why the fuck are they after me?
Maybe cause I'm a bastard
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally
Still tryna figure out, why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I know this is bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switch blade
Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid (Ay)
But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid (whoa)
Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents
Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, ""Stay back nigga!""
We need a little bit of payback
Don't treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around cause when it's done it's done
(Fuck you!)

To tell me now that your soul is free
Oh, the skies are so blue

My hands will lead you as you go

Pouvoir parler à un ange

La douleur

Kidz Bop Kids,"I was lying on the grass on Sunday morning of last week 
Indulging in my self defeat 
My mind was thugged all laced and bugged all twisted wrong and beat 
A comfortable three feet deep 
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week 
Impaired my tribal lunar speak 
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done 
So I missed a million miles of fun 

I know it's up for me 
If you steal my sunshine 
Making sure I'm not in too deep 
If you steal my sunshine 
Keeping versed and on my feet 
If you steal my sunshine 

Check, come here come here, come here 
Wow, look at her 
I know 
I've never seen Sharon look so bad before 
I did once before, but this is pretty bad 
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night? 
Ha ha ha 
Tell, I, Karen I love you 

I was lying on the bench slide in the park across the street 
L-a-t-e-are that week 
My sticky paws were in to making straws out of big fat slurpy treats 
An incredible eight foot heap 
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat 
Involved an under usual feet 
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come 
So I missed a million miles of fun 

I know it's up for me 
If you steal my sunshine 
Making sure I'm not in too deep

When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet

A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton

Crushed rocks till I boogie
Used to hate school
So I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the be	-ball style
Known to act wild and
Make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you
Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when
You were four years old
There was a good man

In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's pa**ion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

When you would be here in my arms

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
I'm spending this one alone he said
Give me a break, this years been crazy
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?

Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face

I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would,
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my hope

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

I'm down to earth like this
Rockin this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
Love my life and my public
Put God first
Then can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got

No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)

It take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets
You get back what you put out
Even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while, you know who to blink with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J.Lo
Act like they don't, but they know

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from (from the Bronx!)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block

Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected

Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love.

She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally see

Can I make it any more obvious
He was a punk

She did ballet
What more can I say
He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well

But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on t.v

Guess who she sees
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know

And they've all got
Tickets to see his show
She tags along
Stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Too bad that you couldn't see,
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy
And I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world

Vacations and shopping sprees
These are a few of her favorite things

She'll get what she wants
If she's willing to please

Kidz Bop Kids,"A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face.
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same.
All the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face.

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl, it's only you and me.

The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go.

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me.

Everything I know, and anywhere I go,
It gets hard but it won't take away my love.
And when the last one falls, when its all said and done.
It gets hard but it won't take away my love.

I wish I could be a fly on your wall
Are you really alone?
Who's stealing your dreams?
Why can't I bring you into my life?
What would it take to make you see that I'm alive?

If I was invisible
Then I could just watch you in your room
If I was invincible
I'd make you mine tonight
If hearts were unbreakable
Then I could just tell you where I stand
I would be the smartest man
If I was invisible
Wait, I already am

Saw your face in the crowd
I call out your name
You don't hear a sound
I keep tracing your steps, each move that you make
Wish I could read what goes through your mind
Wish you could touch me with the colors of your life
