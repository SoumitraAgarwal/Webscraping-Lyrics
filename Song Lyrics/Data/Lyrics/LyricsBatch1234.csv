The O.C. Supertones,"I was listenin in to your transmission (I hear it every night, hear it every night) 
I think there was a problem with my reception (on my satellite, on my satellite)

It seemed like a section of my soul was having trouble with the signal 

I was trying but it just wasn't pickin up 
I guess the frequency was stuck 
And my heart corroded shut

I couldn't tune in to the station that was telecasting my salvation...

But I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.
Yeah it's coming in!

In a room full of doubters You were the sure one. (You were like a light, You were like a light)
In a town of compromises, You are the pure one. (I think You got it right, I think You got it right)

It was water to my soul to hear You singing so honest and simple

I seek to be sophisticated,
But I make it complicated
I over elaborated but now that I have contemplated
I'll write about the love of Jesus and his mercy that never ceases

And I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.
Yeah it's coming in!

It was foolish to be jaded that the cross was intgraded 
I remember Jesus said you either love it or you hate it

I didn't know the words in my heart I was singing with You

And I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I couldn't find it then

And I wanna hear it now
And sing along again
I just don't know how 
I lost that frequency but now it's coming in.",Transmission
The O.C. Supertones,"I've been holding back my rhyme to long,
Let it go and unleash the fury of my old school flow.
I'm no superstar more like a John Doe.
But I'm badder then the water down in Mexico.
Oh no, a rock n' roller man who's not allowed to be rap.
But I write what I like and I like the boom bap.
The rhyme's in the front and the beat's in the back
A trunk full of funk and a page full of fact.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job,
Are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome.

I can't be shy I've gotta come with it.
No fear here! I Sing and bring it.
In Christ you've got no right livin' timid.
He's light in the dark and hope for the wicked.
There's a land of the dead called planet earth
And a race called man walks dead from birth
And the beast and man both bear the curse.
Come from the womb but retrun to dirt.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall overcome.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall over come.

Here's what I do I hope I get through.
So cling to what's true and tell the world too.
Cause some live in fear, oppression from peers.
These kids smoke weed, these kids that drink beers
Who don't want to hear what you got to say
And they shut their ears and laugh cause you pray,
But don't be afraid, that used to be me I used to mock God
But I was empty.

Right about now I'd like to hear everyone say.
Yes o yes we shall over come.
My fans got a job, are we gonna get it done?
Yes o yes we shall overcome",We Shall Overcome
The Oak Ridge Boys,"Some people say that this ole time religion
It's just a thing of the past
But in this modern day that we're livin'
It's the only thing that will last

Now you may think that I'm a little ole fashioned
Well friend, that's alright with me
But I am so glad that I am a Christian
And from sin I have been set free

Well, I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

Not long ago, at an ole fashioned meetin'
I knelt on my knees there in prayer
He lifted my burdens, sin shackles fell from me
And His presence was so real everywhere

Now that this load that I carry is lighter
And He changed my gray skies to blue
My steps are now higher for I have this assurance
That His sweet love will carry me through

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

Come go with me to that land over yonder
He's prepared for the pure and the true
It's a place where sickness and death cannot enter
I'm goin', brother, how about you?

Now maybe today or maybe tomorrow
He'll return in robes of pure white
I'm packin' up now, gettin' my things together
Who knows? It might be tonight

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

I know, I know, there's no doubt about it
He lives in my heart and I'm gonna shout it
I know, I know my sins are forgiven
And I'm on my way to a place that's called Heaven

The Oak Ridge Boys,"There's a place near to me, where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the old country church
There with mother we went, and our Sundays were spent
With our friends at the old country church

As a small country boy, how my heart beat with joy
When I knelt in the old country church
And the Savior above, by His wonderful love
Saved my soul at the old country church

How I wish that today all the people would pray
As we prayed in the old country church
If they'd only confess, Jesus surely would bless
As he did in the old country church

Of't my thoughts make me weep, for so many now sleep
In their graves near the old country church
And sometime I may rest, with the friends I love best
In a grave near the old country church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me (they bring to me)
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the old country church",Old Country Church
The Oak Ridge Boys,"Someday I'll see His blessed face
When I am through with toil and care
I'll leave this world of sin's hand
And see my Savior over there

Well look up, look up and sing God's praise
All our trials and troubles will soon be past
Oh, we'll rise to meet Him in the sky
We'll see our Savior by and by

Well they say my faith is all in vain
And prayer is only wasted time
Oh just wait till Jesus shall appear
I'll leave this world so far behind",Someday
The Oak Ridge Boys,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At the end of a storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark.

Walk on, through the wind,
Walk on, through the rain,
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart,
And you'll never walk alone,
You'll never walk alone.

The Oak Ridge Boys,"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
Callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead, so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time

Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then, I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Across the bay a lady waits to hold me tight,
And my boat and I are ready to set sail.
If the weather keeps on holdin' and the wind is right
I'll be wrapped up in my sweet one's arms tonight.

As I skip across the waves my sails are high and full,
My mind is on the one I wait to see.
And I dream about an island somewhere in my mind,
Where someday I will take her off with me.

Then a smile comes upon me as I look across the bow;
I see a lady on the side.
But she will wait no more as I head for the shore,
Cause tonight I'm gonna take her for a ride.

And we will sail away on the wings of love into the night,
Cast out our fortunes on the sea.
Then we will go to sleep together with the rocking of the water,
And dream of how our life will someday be,
When she sails away with me.",Sail Away
The Oak Ridge Boys,"Waiting on the edge of your prodigle heart
Wanting for someone to save you from yourself
Out there on the edge dangling somewhere in the darkness
Doubting if anybody really cares

But when love reached through the shadows
Whispering your name
Nothing will ever be the same again

For when love calls you home
Forgiveness embrasses a past you once owned
And all the mistakes that carried your name are gone
'Cause that's what happens when love calls you home

Cradled in your mercy that has no limit
I've finally found a place where I belong
Now I can't imagine one moment without you in it
It's hard to believe I tried to make it on my own

But you picked me up from the ruins of my broken life
When every chance was spend you gave me one more try

For when love calls you home
Forgiveness embrasses a past you once owned
And all the mistakes that carried your name are gone
'Cause that's what happens when love calls you home, yeah

For when love calls you home
Forgiveness embrasses a past you once owned
And all the mistakes that carried your name are gone

Nothing he can do 'cos only you can cure me

It's the only way to stop this empty

I'm so hooked on your love I can't live without it
You're away but please don't treat me like a stranger

The Oak Ridge Boys,"When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore and I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again.

If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me

The Oak Ridge Boys,"I used to be so lonely - I used to be so blue
There was a time I thought I'd never see love shinin' through
I could not find a spark of hope - there was darkness in the air
Then I found someone now the clouds are gone and I see love everywhere.

And I said,""Oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah, I said, ""ooh wee"" then I sighed, -- ""Land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

There was a woman that I heard of - they say every night she cried
About a love that long ago had withered up and died
And then one night she was observed by the full light of the moon
With a swing in her hips and a song on her lips and a man
Up in her room

And she said, ""Oh me, oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah she said, ""Ooh, wee"" then she sighed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere"" 

There was a man that lived next to me and I swear that his heart was hard
There wasn't no sunshine on his back porch and no flowers in his yard
He claimed that he'd looked high and low but love could not be found
But it didn't take much - just a woman's touch to turn his world around.

And he said, ""oh me - oh my - mercy mercy - love is everywhere""
Yeah he said, ""Ooh wee"" then he signed, -- ""land o'goshen
Love is everywhere""

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Full moons and empty promises
We were only high school kids
We got so close that we closed our eyes
to the facts of life

We were married in the spring
not long before the baby came
Your mama said she couldn't bare the shame
Your dad refused to give the bride away.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standin' here
And that love would find it's way
Through all the tears
Beyond those years.

Eighteen standin' in the shoes of a man
The weight of the world in my unskilled hands
One by one as the dreams fell through
I took my failures out on you.

But you held on when it made no sense
And cleaned the face of the innocent
You were so strong to be so young
And now look just how far we've come.

Beyond those years
Who'd have thought we'd still be standin' here
And that love would find it's way

Call it off, go our seperate ways
Against the odds we grew up to fast
And on our own, yeah, we made it last.

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Sometimes we're friends, sometimes we're strangers
And though there are tears, there's always love
It hurts when you cry from words thrown in anger
Warm feelings run deep but that's not enough

It takes a little rain to make love grow
It's the heartache and the pain that makes the real heart show
Where the sun always shines there's a desert below
It takes a little rain to make love grow

Hearts disagree, then they grow closer
Honesty wins when it's someone you trust
Forever takes time, true love is never over
It's filled with new starts, just look at us

It takes a little rain to make love grow
It's the heartache and the pain that makes the real heart show
Where the sun always shines there's a desert below
It takes a little rain to make love grow

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story
From the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors

She's comin’ over with the kids today

And there’s a picture on the wall of Jesus in the garden
It’s been there since they got the house in ’53
Hey, there ain’t no big deal, whatever go down in history
It’s just a little story of an American family

But the whole world is different now
Blood's been spilled on our shores
In hard times we pull together
That's what a family's for

Hey, there ain’t no big deal
It's written in our history
We're all part of the story of an American family
We're all part of the story of an American family

The Oak Ridge Boys,"Red as the bloodshed, blue as the wounded, white as the crosses on our soldier's graves. Through the rain, through the sun, these colors never run.

I first saw her standing on the corner of the stage and I've been pledging my allegiance ever since. We often take for granted her old familiar wave but that freedom cost a lot of brave young men and women.

It's one that's red as the bloodshed, blue as the wounded, white as the crosses on our soldier's graves. Through the rain, through the sun, these colors never run. No they never will.

Now I've seen people treat her like she was some old rag, clueless to the human sacrifice. But you'll always find a mother, a widow, a child, a sister or a brother with a carefully folded teardrop in their eyes.

It's one that's red as the bloodshed, blue as the wounded, white as the crosses on our soldier's graves. Through the rain, through the sun, these colors never run. No, these colors never run.

From wanted to wanted
Don't you know angels sing above
When someone goes from love to love?

Her boy's gettin' married, she can barely look up
Tears runnin' she can barely look up

A proud mama slides a bobby pin in a long white veil
Time to give her little girl away and she tries to smile
Tears runnin' she tries to smile

And the girl goes from love to love
From wanted to wanted
Angels sing above when someone goes from love to love

A long time ago her daddy left behind
His only baby in a little town one night
All the new mom went to see was beauty lyin' in her arms
But the eyes of heaven could see across

The Ocean,"There are moments in life
When man with his louse ridden hair
Casts wild staring looks
At the green membranes of space, for he believes
He hears, somewhere ahead

The wry hoots of a phantom
He staggers and bows his head
What he has heard is the voice of his own conscience
He is determined and alert
And with the speed of a madman he rushes out

Takes the first direction his wold state suggests
And bounds over the rough plains of the wield
But the yellow phantom never loses sight of him
Chasing him with equal speed, sometimes on stormy nights

When legions of winged octopi which look like ravens at a distance
Hover above the clouds, moving ponderously
Towards the cities of men, there in the dark
Their mission is to warn them on such nights the dark eyed grit

Sees two beings passing by one after another
And wiping a furtive tear of compassion
Which flows out from its frozen eye
It shouts out, ""Yes, certainly he deserves it
It is only justice being done"" having said that

He re-assumes his grim attitude and continues to watch
And continues to watch, trembling nervously, the manhunt
The phantom makes a clicking sound with its tongue as if to tell itself
It's giving up the chase, his is the voice of the condemned

And when its dreadful shrieking penetrates the human heart
Man would prefer to have death as his mom
Than to have remorse as his son, I have seen him
Making for the sea, climbing a jagged promontory

Lashed by the eyebrow of the surge
And flinging himself down, into the waves
The miracle is this, the corpse reappeared the next day
On the surface of the raging sea
Which had brought this flotsam of pale flesh back to the shore

The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
He wrung the water from his drenched hair
The man freed himself from his body's imprint in the sand
Wrung the water from his drenched hair
And silently returned to the way of life

Unconditional projection alternates with short,
Fervid intervals of perfection
And boundless bonding - but be sure:

Territories abandoned, lost and reclaimed

And the constraints of our modern living
Which leave no space for the arational

Let them be helpless
Let them embrace symbols of commitment
To compensate for the lack of it

I happen on your smile
Gleaming through a photograph
Buried for some while

I'm taken by the way
The swagger captured there
Has vanished in the haze of time

And by a foolish whim I'm stricken with desire
To phone you up and tell you of my find
But as I stretch my hand

I'm reminded of the shape I'm in
From all the things you've left
Behind

Man, I hate your friends
They really bring me down
And I can tell you're not yourself
Whenever they're around

So ditch this motley crew
For all the world of me
And leave these sorry few
Behind

I hope that by some master plan
You're in the same boat that I am
Waiting at a crossing path
To seal away your life

To lock inside a sacred bond so tight
And like this photograph
The scattered thoughts of you
Are frozen in the amber of my mind

And boxes on the shelf of documents
Reminding me you
Left an empty shell

To my young body's aching desire
For an older woman's well banked fire
By the left hand I was led
To the place that we would make our bed
And embracing in the blue moonlight
She said, ""Don't ever forget this night.""

You're only temporarily strong

I've got mercy, mercy to go
I've got mercy, mercy to go
And then it's all gone

'Cause he'll use you as a life raft if he can

Then the tree, and then the whole ranch

'Cause I've got mercy, mercy to go
I've got mercy, mercy to go
I've got mercy, mercy to go
And then it's all gone

As I mature, I learn to speak my mind
On the other hand I learn to be patient; let it ride
Between these two traits is a line
You step on it all of the time
Why do these things always happen to you?
I wish I had the time to let them swallow me too
When we count up all of our wounds
You're the desert, I'm one of the dunes

I never met a manipulator that wasn't paranoid
They see in themselves what in others they should avoid
All the devious plans aren't there
Ghosts fly out from under their hair
And I get to hear about it, and it comes in heavy waves
And I'm lying under your downer with no breathing space

And I've still got mercy, mercy to go
And when it's all gone
I guess it's all gone",Mercy to Go

I still reach for you

A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Forever we've been
Trapped by our hearts
Trapped by our minds
I'd like to leave
I'd like to win at love

But I just can't let it go
And I just can't watch it slipping away
And I just can't let it go
And I just can't stand another minute

Maybe now someday our shattered live
Will mend themselves again
But now a million miles away
I still wish I could
And though I somehow know, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you",A Thousand Days

Just keep it your own

I wonder why our world is ablaze
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say
I try to have an open mind
But your brain and mouth must not be connected

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just leave me alone

I would be patient but it takes so long
I don't want all this misinformation
All the words that you say
Lean on me while I lean on you
If we destroy each other
We might save a life or two
A little sun, a little shine
Separates us both by forever and a day

They´re shooting little kids with toy guns

Beat all the white trash
Beat whoever you see
Don´t need a reason
(We´re) L.A.P.D. 

They say they´re keeping the peace
But I´m not buying it because a billy club ain´t much of a pacifier
""Protecting your freedom""
Now that´s just a lie

It´s an excuse for power that´s more like an alibi

And you've really done a lot of junk now

But you keep abusin' it

It's bad enough you do it to yourself
But taking someone with you well you know that's something else

I say I'm not that kind of person
I'm not that kind of man

I might be sympathetic or cut a little slack

If I thought that you were willing to give a little back
But you do it in the morning
You do it in the night
You lie to refrain from just facing your life

So I'll see you man tomorrow
You'll be gackin' up again

And he rides the bomb to hell
Yeah he rides the bomb to hell

Watch the pulse, it quickens after every little sting
If you're gonna go to hell
Drinking up you might as well

Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on the missile with the cowboy hat, and

Well the world is gonna end
So dance around the fire that we once believed in

Wanna tear it down again, now
'Cause there's nothing left for us to be
Give it up the sons of anarchy
So come around and have another round of me

Dance f***er dance, let the motherf***er burn, hey!

Are you really gonna take it like that?
Riding on the missile with the baseball bat, and

Well we're pouring gasoline
So dance around the fire that we once believed in

It'll never be the same
The takers and the liars that we all believed in

Well we're going down in flames
So dance around the fire
We dance around the fire

'Cause it's never left for us to be
Give it up the champions of grief
So come around and have another round of me

Hey, hey!

Dance f***er dance, let the motherf***er burn, hey!",Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell

Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back but it's never coming back. And I thought I knew a better way. I'd lose myself in anything that could take away the pain. Years spent running and I never knew the cost. But shattered mirrors and broken hearts finally showed me what I'd lose. Yea it's like the time is slipping through the cracks. But now, now I wish that I could take it back. We've all been lost before we've all been knocked to the ground. Let go of our regrets and find the strength to turn it around. I know it might seem far too late but we're just about to break these chains that have always held us back.

The Olympics,"I went to a dance with my sister Kate; 
Everybody there thought she danced so great; 
I realized a thing or two, 
When I got wise to something new: 

When I looked at Kate, she was in a trance, 
And then I knew it was in her dance; 
All the boys are going wild 
Over sister Katie's style. 

Oh, I wish I could I shimmy like my sister Kate; 
She shimmies like a jelly on a plate. 
My mama wanted to know last night, 
What makes the boys think Kate's so nice. 

Now all the boys in the neighborhood, 
They know that she can shimmy and it's understood; 
I know that I'm late, but I'll be up-to-date 
When I shimmy like my sister Kate. 
I mean, when I shimmy like my sister Kate. 

Now I can shimmy like my sister Kate, 
I know that I'm real late, 
I think I'll do a real shimmy dance, 
Dancing like my sister Kate, 
Sweet papa, just like my sister Kate.

The Ominous Seapods,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

The Opus,"[Verse 1 : Slug]
It was a purple-purple sky and an orange-orange moon
And everyone was whistling the same damn tune
Except Brian, Brian staired out across the field
And watch the horizon blossom to cop a field
Over the edge of the world
The one they're all afraid to walk
Ration out the why they're so high on the small talk
But Brian knows where the crows all go
To find the if's, and the and's and the but's and also's

Chorus:
If I could run through the woods, and speed like the light
I?d find the answers to why, and be back by tonight
If I could fly through the fog and look at this rock
I?d figure out how to keep Hell off of my block
But as it stands, I stay content
Tryin? to be the magic man, and pay my rent
Wishing that Brian would turn me on to the secrets he sought
While we keep burning the dawn, just to keep the day hot 

[Verse 2 : Slug]
If I could ask you one question, I?d ask where you went
You could teach me a lesson every time I got bent
But the alcohol don't make me forget about it all
doesn't matter the season the leaves can still fall
They slipped hidden messages within the cards that were dealt
I understand myself and all of the sorrow I felt
For as simple as I'am how'd it get so complex
Got me studying the margins and disregarding the text
I open the curtins and listen to the traffic go
But I still get nervous each time my peace passes go
The residue is thick and the memory fails
I still laugh 'cause the path feels a lot like a trail

Chorus:

We used to be a couple of pimps walking the hallways with pride
Drunk or sober, life was nothing short of rollercoaster rides
Trip to the clubs, now the skull to the rhythm
All we wanted out of life was what was given
And when you passed I wanted to take back the time we wasted
I'd trade all the buzzes in for one more conversation
We can sit in the shade and discuss the meaning of sacred
Cause I can't see the garden no more, just the avens
But the wind still blows and the plains still grow
And I wish your name was on the guest list at my shows
I got to believe you can see me run up on my freedom
Cause you got to meet up with the son before you got to meet my son

The Orb,"Did you ever get the felling you're being followed?

Are you not familiar with the Revelations of St.John
The final book of the Bible, prophesied the apocalypse

Or on his forehead so that no one shall be able
To buy or sell unless he has that mark
Which is the name of the beast and the number of his name
And the number of the beast is '6 6 6'

What can such a specific prophecy mean?
What is the mark?

Well, the mark is the bar-code
The ubiquitous bar-code that you'll find on every bog roll
And every packet of Johnnies and every poxy-pork-pie
And every bar-code is divided into two parts by three markers
And those three markers are always represented by the number six
'6 6 6'

And what does it say?
No one shall be able to buy or sell without that mark
And now what they're planning to do
In order to eradicate all credit card fraud
And in order to precipitate a totally cashless society?

What they're planning to do
And they've already tested it on the American troops
They're gonna subcutaneously laser-tattoo
That mark onto your right hand or onto your forehead
They're going to replace plastic with flesh, fact

In the same book of Revelations
When the Seven Seals are broken open on the Day of Judgment
And the seven angels blow their trumpets
When the third angel blows her trumpet
Wormwood will fall from the sky
And wormwood will poison a third part of all the waters
And a third part of all the land and many, many, many people will die

They're going to line up in the big signs
Of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus and Scorpio
Which just happen to correspond
To the four beasts of the apocalypse
As mentioned in the book of Daniel, another fact

Do you think that the amoeba ever dreamed
That it would evolve into the frog?
And when that first frog shimmied out of the water
And employed its vocal chords in order to attract a mate
[Incomprehensible] a predator

Do you think that that frog ever imagined
That incipient croak would evolve
Into all the languages of the world
Into all the literature of the word, possibly?
And just as that froggie could never have possibly
Conceived of Shakespeare
So we can never possibly imagine our destiny

Look, if you take the whole of time represented by one year
But only in the first few moments of the 1st of January
It's a long way to go
And no, we're not going to sprout extra limbs and wings and things
Because evolution itself is evolving
When it comes, the apocalypse itself will be a part of the process

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Spread the word I'll cross the land
Must make people understand
Wish I had a magic wand
To connect people united as one

this goes out to all the girls
On the mic might send you round the bend
Boys will be boys, listen right to the end!

If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

The Original Wildcat Jass Band,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying in the Chapel

Hoping and longing,

Forever will shine

Till the roses turn to ashes
Till the organ turns to rust

Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""

I got a funny little feeling that you are about to put me down
All my friends have been talking bout the way you mistreat me
It wouldn't have been this way if I'd have done what my Mama said.

She said son, let me give you some advice
You'd better remember this for the rest of your life

Mama said find 'em, fool 'em, forget 'em, yeah, yeah, yeah

I went on and gave my heart to you girl
You walked on it, huh, you misused it

That everyone's heart isn't filled with the gladness and love for one another.

While we're on the way to there, why not share

The Osmonds,"Life without loving is no life at all.
When there's no one to help you up whenever you fall.
The day's never ending with nothing to share.
And the house is so empty, you're the only one there.

So take love if ever you find love.
It comes along for everyone someday.
So take love if ever you find love and I found love, girl, when I found you.

Chances are many in all that you do.
So beware of a false love if you want one that's true.
And maybe tomorrow will bring love your way, and do what you can, make sure
love's there to stay.

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

As we dream by the fire

I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

The Osmonds,"Her heart has had more knocks than a gypsy's tambourine
Yet it's worth more gold than any man has ever seen
And although no one has fallen for her like she's fallen for them
She says her heart isn't broken, it's only broken in
She's ready for someone to love her
Someone to hold her tight
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night
She's weathered the whirlwind romance
Stood through the one-night stands
She's ready for someone to love her
Who'll be the lucky man
Well she has had her fill of those unfullfilling men
You know the kind that come calling never to call back again
Oh she's bound and determined not to be fooled anymore
And poor thing she'll keep that promise
The same way she kept it before
She's ready for someone to love her
Someone to hold her tight
Some to curl up next to when her feet get cold at night
She's weathered the whirlwind romance
Stood through the one-night stands

And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory you wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

And as long as my heart will beat, lover we'll always meet

And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Outfield,"Without a word I'd know what to say
If you stared at me my eyes would refuse to stray
Sixty seconds is all it takes
For the nine to five man to be more than one minute late

There's a clock on the wall
A mirror reflecting it all
Just an imageless photograph

To wake up not knowing where I am today
I don't drive the same car
I don't live the same way

All the love, I'll be sending you girl

Time after time I put my life on the line
But I ain't committed no crime, so take what you can find
Forget what I say 'cause I'll keep running away
I only live for today, but I'm one day behind

All the love, I'll be sending you girl

Give me all the names who saw you there

Don't you know I hate those clothes you wear
For I've seen men undress you

Around in a circle no end or beginning

Burning down but this man stands his ground

Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you

Stay the night but keep it under cover
I just want to use your love tonight

I don't want to lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shaking

But something in my mind's not making sense
It's been a while since we were all alone

But I can't hide the way I'm feeling

As you're leaving please would you close the door?
And don't forget what I told you
Just 'cause you're right that don't mean I'm wrong

I bet there's not a man in here that doesn't feel the same

Wish that I wasn't alone with myself

Seems that I can't think of anyone else

Selling their souls for the magic seed

At a price, offering a bed for the night
Nobody cares, a sign of the life she's wasted

In a city where it's all gone wrong
Too many people and they don't belong
Suffocating on the air they breathe

So afraid, nowhere else to go now
Far far away, there's a place
That you once called home but

Thoughts are out there in the darkness
They'd given their hearts to the boys in the past
Now it's so lonely without them

It's late at night but downtown in the city
They walk the streets, the lights turn red
A broken voice in their imagination
They can't believe the things she said

I can give you more than anyone can
Perfect strangers living in a new land

The raintown boys are so far away
Been living it up on the shore
No doubt in their minds they're all gonna stay
There's nothing left to go home for

They've found a better life inside this city
Their fears are gone, their fortunes changed
Just like they were made for one another
The boy's won't ever be the same

The raintown boys ain't coming back to town no more
They've had enough of living in the past for sure

No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more

Highnoon driver's got a kick tail beater
And he rides just as fast as he knows
Long shot dealer sold a real fire eater
Burning money just as fast as she goes
Kid don't care 'cause he can't get enough
Easy come - easy go
Tells his mama that he ain't living under a stone
An' he's ready oh - oh

Late night pleaser spends her daytime teaching
In the small town missionary hall
Back seat teaser never takes any money
But her friends make it nailed to the wall
She don't care 'cause she can't get enough
One way ticket to the ball
Tells here mama that she ain't living under a stone

One night in the middle of main street
Riding in a big flash car
Sets his eyes on the good time seeker
She jumps inside but they go too far

Years go by and they've both grown older
Kinda' sorry for the things that they did
Lookin' back they could have both been something
But their caution ran away with the wind
Life ain't never been an easy touch
They got a house that they can't afford
And teenage kids saying they can't live under a stone

Should be
Yes if you let me love you - I'll show you the way it

It's just how I feel when - I try to make you see
That you could have anything if you'd - put your trust

I'm always afraid of what you might think of me
It could all be the same - the way that it used to be

Picture a castle where - a fool is all you see
I'm living in hope that one day - you might rescue me
'cause I'd wait forever if I - thought you'd set me free

You know that I'm not ready to wait
I don't wanna be late

Oh chic lorraine ­ here she comes again
I've been up all night ­ love don't come no better

There? s only so many rivers I'd cross
My love's already lost - you make it happen girl
Oh you make it happen girl

I've been up all night ­ love don't come no better
Oh chic lorraine ­ here she comes again
I've been up all night ­ love don't come no better

And I don't wanna leave her alone

There? s only so much fun I can take
Before I'm ready to break

The rhythm of the rain
Breaks the silence
Beats against my window
As the moment slips away
And I just can't explain
In your absence there is nothing
I try in vain - but I can't kiss the rain

And a miracle can stay
In my mind forever more
It can take my blues away
But it can't stop the rain
And it won't stop me crying
As the rhythm starts again
Inside my head

The rhythm of your name
Undecided uninvited
Speaks to me just like you? re here again
And I just can't remain
Undecided unprovided
So in vain I tried to kiss the rain

And an orchestra can play
Any song I've ever heard
But they? ll never know my name
And they can't stop the rain
And they won't stop me crying

The Outlaws,"Another night with open eyes
Too late to sleep, too soon to rise
You're short of breath, is it a heart attack?
Hot and feverish you face the fact

You're in love and it feels like shame
Because she's gone and made a fool of you in public again
You're in love and it feels like pain
Because you know there's too much truth in everything she claims

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she wants you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

You drift into the strangest dreams
Of youthful follies and changing teams
Admit you're wrong, oh, no, not yet
Then you wake up and remember that you can't forget

She's made you some kind of laughin' stock
Because you dance to disco and you don't like rock
She'd make fun of you and even in bed
Said, ""She was gonna go and get herself a real man instead""

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?
Or do you want revenge?
But that's childish, so childish
But that's childish, so childish

Remember when you were more easily led
Behind the cricket pavilion and the bicycle shed
Trembling as your dreams came true
You looked right into those blue eyes and knew

It was love and now you can't pretend
You've forgotten all the promises of that first friend
It's not enough, she knows how you feel
But she's not prepared to share you with the memory

So ask yourself now, can you forgive her
If she begs you to?
Ask yourself, can you even deliver
What she demands of you?

He was by the waterhole

Same clouds above disappear

Too many dreams have been shattered around us.

They'll never discover these feelings I hide.
Deep inside I'm falling apart.
All alone with a broken heart.
Thinking in silence is all they allow.
These words still unspoken may never be found.
All these dreams one day will be mine.
They cross my mind.
My time has yet to come.  Until then.

The Pandas,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

The Paper Chase,"I did a terrible thing
When I monkey-wrenched your circuitry.
And when they finally got to me,
I had built a monster worse than me,
And far worse than you.

And I have become such an ungrateful man -
Just to steal those words you whispered out,
And I snickered in between.
The check point, the boot hill, the ass in me
Says some things still best left unsheathed,
Or out come the knives.

So, retire to your ant hill,
Or cover tire tracks,
And learn to choke it back.
And when they get to you, they'll see
I did a terrible thing,
With a sober mind.

Make no mistake;
I just couldn't stop the hand.
But when you're happy and you're safe,
You'll do anything to keep it that way.

So, do you need the baseball bat,
Or do you need something elite?
Do you need that to feel safe?
Do you need that to feel safe?

(for example)
Last night I took my sharpest blade,
And I cut my tent another five inch slit
To make sure I get away.

And when our weary heads
Hit our sleeping bags,
The brutal honesty
Can tend to spill out, and me
I like to whisk you all away -
Whisk you all away
With my terrible mind.

And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
Get past their doors,
We can hate these sinners
The way we hurt our fathers.

To shove away the hand so fast?
Who do you think you are?
Well, maybe I'm the devil,
To harbor the sick and obscene.
Maybe this, the albatross,
I'm like an ivory tower -
Level or power, but

You are not the innocent.

What do you take me for,
You mother fucker?
What do you take me for,
When I'm a sheperd's light,
When I'm a quantum leap?
You don't want freedom;
You want trick photography.
It's a good thing
I'm an airbrushed girl,
A diamond ring.
I need it new;
I need it rising above.
(Meanwhile),
The jury laughs at you, love.

You are not the innocent.

Oh, dirty hands,
A little place called trust,
But you ain't sold one, yet.

(I once told you
I have my ""wants"" and ""needs""
And ""want you to's"".
It all depends.
And then the album
Skipped the end,
So I got up
To play it again.
I know you.
I know that look.
I know this little attitude,

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

 ""Presence Of A Brain""
Mmmm, mmm-hmmm
Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
You can tell he's a thinker 
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

A penny for his thoughts can make you richer
His eyes can see what other eyes could not
What is the power of Napolean
But not mere power, but magnetism
And magnetism is more intelligent than force
Magnetism is more intelligent than force

A duba diba diba duba duba
Bump bump da day ooh ow

Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
But you can tell he's a thinker 
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

When god's children start thinking together
Learning to live and love one another, hey, hey, hey

",All Your Goodies Are Gone
The Parlor Mob,"I started the day by the tree where the sea was of nothing
I was closer to God in my dreams but still out of my head
When all of the leaves and the moments were in their way touching
A blanket of change and the listening for what will be said

When all that I knew was the wind and the faces before me
I spoke with the purpose and strength of a thousand young man
When the weight of the world and their wolves were out there to destroy me
I stood in the grass on the hill with my will to defend

This is the start of something
This is the end of who we were
The beginning of what we will be
This is the call to something
This is a chance at something pure
The only chance that we can see

When everything else disappears
We'll live out our lives beyond years

Where's the forgiveness we said would be written all over
Where is the peace and the freedom we said would be ours
Have we been lost in a dead winter whispering clover
Can we get back to the truth in the bees and the flowers

The Partridge Family,"Well I thought my life was over when she walked right out on me
And I watched the world around me just explode
That's when I hit the highway, that's how I came to be
Morning Rider on the road

Well, I'd wake up in the morning with the sunshine in my eyes
And the music of the Canyon would begin
And I'd soar just like an eagle through the blue Montana skies
Like a glider on the wind

There were times when I was hungry, times I missed a friend
But sleep would hush it over

There were times the rain would wake me and all my dreams would end
But a dream can't last forever

Na na na... Morning rider on the road
Na na na... Morning rider in the sun

There were times when I was happy, being free was fun
Like a hobo in the sun

There were times when I was lonely and I'd wish the night was done
Like an Indian on the run

And all at once I met you and you stop me in my tracks
And all at once I lose the urge to roam
So the hobo in the sun, and the Indian on the run
And the rider on the highway found a home

And all at once I met you and you stop me in my tracks

I decided I'd rather sing it

May you find the sweet fulfillment in everything you do

And I knew you were the one,
Who gave me somethin to believe in

We can feel it but we know
We can't let our feelings show,

""No Good,"" that's what they say about me,
You should try and live without me,
No good, they'll never understand,

Maybe someday, we can find a way to be together,
Baby someday, they'll leave us alone,
Maybe someday, there may be some way
We can sing our songs together,

Don't you worry what they say,
'Cause with every passing day,
We get closer to tomorrow,

And tomorrow we'll be free,
To be what we want to be,

They say, ""He's really not your kind,""
""Look out, you know that love is blind,""
""Look out,"" But they don't really see

Maybe someday, we can find a way to be together,
Baby someday, they'll leave us alone,

That I opened up my eyes

I won't let it pass me by

Something changed as you walked away from me
So I made myself a world that would let nobody in
Cause it's only now that I see what a fool I've been

To do what only love can do
Any plans that I had for one
Can easily be made for two

That I am not going to be the one

That have the right amount of letters

That could make you hear
Make you see

Touch your face, your hand

From my hammock down my tree and into Melbourne town
Now first stop hit Kanelata to Tedesco land
To down that show - with 2 shoes and a magic hand man
Now it's a plan as flamenco turns to -down shakin
There's a jazz jam and Julie's got the whole joint bakin'
And anyone who's fakin' gets a quick anihilation
As we movin' destinations on the music train station singing
'on and on and on'. ""on and on and on""
Checkin' checkin' out Mr Askey's song cos he's
Late sevens' captain-on-the-mic but blows the horn so fierce
That the room ignite
It's like his shuffle got us thinking about dowing the down low so where we go?
We take the night cat stop for the cabrones show
And here's the point I stop reciting start to dance instead
I heard the city of the deep blue lights it said:
Now get the party started

It wasn't hard to get the party started

Chillin' at the club, pimpin' with my money
Well actually, my parties are more like
Chillin' in the sun with tea and milk and honey
Tea and lamingtons, that's my idea of fun
But I do enjoy the odd ocaasional bottle of rum
As we learn in the songs that I have previously sung
When it's done with fruit juice at a barbecue in the sun
If afternoon is begun with kangaroo and capsicum
I do eat meat but I don't like killing
So don't crash my party while I'm sitting back chilling
My oh my why oh why are people so violent
I ain't trying to be a lion I extend my alliance
To anyone who like to just sit back and chitchat
Maybe have a jam, spit scats and eat biscuits
Before you know it's midnight and you're running through the moonlight
And you realize

It wasn't hard to get the party started

Dubwo and Hendo started it blow by blow
Notw it's a dancehall rockin' like a Cuban mojo

No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine there's no countries

Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

The holler of the driver was my lullaby.

She was the only daughter of the engineer
My sweetheart loved the brakeman and that ain't no joke
Its a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.

I wish I could have seen the stone that went a rollin' away when they looked inside the door to where the grave clothes lay
I didn't see but I believe that he ascended in the air

They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The distant moanin' of a train

It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.

The man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite;

Vessel only out a day and making water fast;

Climbing softly up the pole, and when she reached the top,
Put her foot upon the electric wire, which tied her in a knot.

The cat came back, we thought he was a goner
But the cat came back; it just couldn't stay away.

With seven little kittens till there came a cyclone;
Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around,

Play the beat nigga forever mind body and soul

The Pharcyde,"Yo fat lip man
Yo man they tryin' to run a power move on us man
Yo man
You got to tell the suckers what's up boy
Yeah ha-ha

I got a letter from the DMV
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended
For a minute then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock
On the dot
So I think I'd better
Scoot off to school
'Cause in class there's a test
I gotta dress fast
Grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn
As hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride
Pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse
Into first
And disperse and
From that very moment on my day got worse

As I was standing in the street
I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derek's on his way
I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room
It took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car
We drove away in a zoom
I assume doom
As we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble
About my life, is actually shambles
Should have took the bus
A bus without the silence or some old Nikes
I wish we had good bikes
We need to exercise
Maybe we could take a hike
And you could give Sheri back those car keys
Because everywhere I walk I would not have to say please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Please
Don't pull me over Mr. officer
Don't pull me over Mr. officer please

Away
To our destination
No license no insurance
Not even registration
Tags on the plate say December '82
Car's so dirty it looks gray
But it's really blue
Who would
Think we're up to good
Four black niggas ridin' through the neighborhood
In hats and glasses
Makin' funny passes
Like drivin' slowly
Playin' low-key for asses
Knowin' damn well one-time will harass us
And all the while
We see girls jog
Sheri's little car is pourin' out smog
Then we made a right and I spotted one in tights (Yo baby what's up, pull over)

(You live with your homeboys? Yeah I live with my homeboys
That's where you're takin' me to your house
Where your homeboys are? 
I mean but they're not home, 
You ain't got your own crib? 
Naw I ain't got) (5-0 man, 5-0)

Lights, action
Without the camera
Sirens and high beams
Two to a tee
The blue coat billy goats are crowding up my rear view
Hot on the tail of an innocent being
My heartbeat is racin' at a pace so fast
I'm wishin' that the coppers would get off my ass
My tail, can't go to jail 'cause it's wack
What would happen to my girl and my record contract
Yo fellas (What)
Take off the baseball caps
Word up I heard that the nerves get tapped
And throw on the glasses and give up the (Tees)
Oh please don't pull me over officer please

The Pharcyde,"Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would if he could
But I didn't want to pass it up
To the next man had my Walkman bumpin' on
The fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller driller tiller out with the Miller brew
Filler up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweettalker so I got ill
With my Lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin ""ooh"" and I'm busted for real
(He came and went at the same time)

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me grease
'Cause I slips and I slides when I rides on the beast

And then come the she my homey's m-o-m what (m-i-e)
Yo, and to think from day one in my eyes I show fear 'cause
I stepped into his house, his mom's grinnin' ear to ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
Oh what the hell is what I said to myself so that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch and wish Greg would please hurry up
She offered me a cup of ripple, broke out the titty
Squeezed her nipple, said, ""Suck it if you like but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam par dick ma wah
Flipped this old bitch in a doggie style
Greg walked in the room that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh sh

One fine summertime Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple samurai Suzuki dookie braids was an aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope, man, real dope on the real
Well anyway I went toot toot she said hey beep beep
The next day rolled down to the beach, deuce deep
Me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck suck suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause everytime I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like quit b
Bitch was frontin' but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden as if someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please God no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go, shit

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit",Oh Shit!
The Pharcyde,"So here it is, fuck it, friends or no friends I had enough bullshit
To last me clear to the ends of my term
I hate worms, so I'mma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah I wish that I change then I could shed all the mains
You trippin' on my ego but all my shit is sustained
Order order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch I could chill as a bum (ho hum)
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my peers on my nuts, and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting heavy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe my friends you slip me
I might have the ego but you'll tell me who're tripping
I know and it shows, I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're effected by the e-g-o

I woke up in the mornin' to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'mma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before, and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot
While my girl is asleep I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa-butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the naughty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense
If you don't know what comes next, well you're just too dense

Who's chasin' me, scrapin' my knee on the cement is what I did
What dug, look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night struck a slug, but no, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck said scream and you're dead
I thought it was the devil 'cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-m-a-n-i
First I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head you know Imani feels no shame
I grabbed my nine I said, ""watch my millimeter go bang""
I got him, he's crippled so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang bang bang, yep I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But um anyway I'm just protectin' my shit
'Cause if it wasn't me he's killin' then my moms mighta got it
It's on the downlow
Don't tell nobody I killed him all right?

Eyes cry, tears fear
A baby eagle seagull shit falls quicker than a local hero
Zero from zero leaves nothin', now ain't that somethin'?
And all this time you been wantin' somethin' for nothin'
The crew has pushed your button 'cause your frame is on recall
The homies kick the fact 'cause its wack to let you fall
Brother don't want you rollin' in the hood, so niggas that don't wantcha
And you're fucked, crazy fucked, like the slut Heather Hunter
Will be the one that punch you, shit, I know you'll get the pic
With the cars and the girls and the ego and the loot chief
I'll make this brief, I'd be lyin' through my teeth
If I told you, you was dope and your benefits was reaped
From my ego, those libro kids are creepin' with the steel
And you're cappin' 'bout this rappin' and they cavin' in the grill
