I'm bout to prove my fame, 
So just get out the way and let me do the thing,

You can't stop the train, 
You ain't got no unbrella so get your ass out the rain, 
You ain't louder than this!

I'm what they play in the club, 
I keep them moving till i leave, thats what they paying me for, 
You already know what i do, 
So have my money and my munchies and my cigar too,

Ain't nobody cutting up but MC now MC

Keep laughing till your moth tired, 
Go ahead and lit something up but take that ciggarette outside,

And if i ain't a fool why you can't keep still sing

I never (who would've thought baby)
Thought I'd be (missing you baby)
Without you (I need you baby)
By me (why me?)

[Ja Rule]
Love what your body does to me
On me, asking me, off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
Fuck then fall asleep, locking for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe
It's deeper than that, now

[Chorus 1]
Baby if we got together again
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You're never gonna let me go baby

Promise I will be by your side
I'll be everything you need to get by
What I broke you know we finally mend
Baby if we got together again

[Nate]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait
And if I had another best friend
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby, what would you do?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2: Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]
Baby if we got together again (who would've thought baby)
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend (missing you baby)
I would love you unconditionally (I need you baby)
You're never gonna let me go baby (why me?)

Promise I will be by your side (who would've thought baby)
I'll be everything you need to get by (missing you baby)
What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)
Baby if we got together again (why me?)

[Ja Rule]
Why would you want to go through the pain?
The loving another name
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame
We can't even get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit, the flesh is weak
But the game is strong
We go my way, your way baby, we moving on
It's true, goin' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

[Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]
I never thought (baby there's nothing to lose)
Thought I'd be (you know my soul's so cold)
Without you (and my love is pain)
By me (spit it one more time)
I never thought (my baby)
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
By me (no doubt, whoa)

Trouble your brain

Mariah Carey,"Who would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together
And who could've forseen

In you I'd find the place
I've belonged forever
And if I move closer
Then love will take over

And lead the way
I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure

And now
Nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you

And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
Suddenly you are lying

Here with me and the truths
I used to hold have changed
And if I move closer
And let it take over

Then love will lead the way
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way",Lead the Way

You kinda got me like a feen 
When you hold out 
Now get your boys ? for me

I got myself a lover 
Who knows what I like 
When he invites me over 
I come every time

Takes me for a ride

Up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl 

Me your loverboy

Like sex toys
Making noise
Can't avoid 

The way I throw that
Can't pop
Back drop
Stop watch

Get ya mo' rock harder
All of the things you want to do to me
If you want to
We can get obscene

When the sensation
Come out

But girl don't I make you scream
Uh-huh, uh-huh baby 
Feel me 
When I pump-pa-pump lady 
Remind me we can be
Close like family
So sweet 
You taste like 
All types of candy 
From Starburst to jelly beans 

Banana split my 
Dairy Queen 
Butterfinger
My tangerines 
Chickens only taste my loverboy
In their dreams

Mariah Carey,"You're with me
Till the bitter end
What we had transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave
Enough to love again
A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved
In my mind
In the memories
There is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember

Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved
In my mind
In the memories
I'll find solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
And I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember

A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved
In my mind
In the memories
There is solace

Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And though we can never be
I'll always think of
You and me
Always remember

Mariah Carey,"Reflections of your love 
Have come to wither

I thought I'd done my best to memorize
A picture fades of you and I together
I haven't come to terms
With how we said goodbye 

Did you really care
Care at all for me
Did you really care
Did you care at all for me at all 

A displaced little girl
Wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you'd materialize
She pressed on night and day

To keep on living
And tried to many ways
To keep her soul alive 
Did you really care
Care enough for me
Did you really care

Did you care at all for me 
If I'm not quite good enough
Or somehow undeserving of

A mother's love 
You could have had the decency
To give me up
Before you gave me life 
Don't you even care 
Just the slightest little bit for me
Cause I really need to feel you cared

Even once upon a time for me
I need to believe, in my heart of hearts, you care for me
I need to understand
Why you left me there so helplessly 

Don't you even care
Care at all for me
Reflections of your love
Have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize",Reflections (Care Enough)
Mariah Carey,"She was kind of fragile
And she had a lot to grapple with
But basically she kept
It all inside
Childlike and effervescent
With a well of pain
The depth of
I could not imagine
If I tried

Never thought that I
Would hear them say
Twister went and
Threw it all away

She was kind of magical
Her laughter sent you casually
Floating through a moment
Of release

Dear God
It's all so tragic
And I'll never
Have the chance
To feel the closure
That I ultimately need
No, I never dreamed
That there would
Come a time
Twister'd go and
Leave it all behind

Lord I pray
She's found some peace
And her soul's
Somewhere at ease

Yeah I'm feeling kind of fragile
And I've got a lot to handle
But I guess this is my way
Of saying goodbye",Twister
Mariah Carey,"It's just the way
I want you baby
Oh so bad
It's just the feeling

That comes over me
I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I
Would conceal the truth

You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child
Inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but

Then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire
But I am not that girl today
Ain't a lot of time for games

I've waited and
I've waited now
It's time for me to tell you
'Bout the way

It's just they way
I want you baby

Baby I
Was so into you
Now I wonder why
I never pursued
You the way I wanted to

Kiss me and touch me and
Immerse your love in mine
I'll keep unraveling
As we explore

Our fantasies tonight
(Tell me what you like)

What you like)

It's just the way

You kind of got me like in a freeze when you roll out
You got itchy balls from where I blow that

I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
When my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his loving gets me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy
Come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
So come on sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we're going
It's delirium time

I get weak
And his candy's just so sweet
He caressed my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy
Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long

Come on and take me

Come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long

Come on, yeah, well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of lover, you adore me
Even though my image is thug

What I see in you is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you, up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone We come touch toys
Making noise
We can't avoid

The way I throw that, can't pop
Backdrop, stopwatch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock, hard up
All of the things that you want to do to me
If you want to we can get obscene
My cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not
When the sensation come out

I'll make you scream ""Uh huh uh huh baby""
Feel me When I pump the pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my Loverboy in they dreams
All my ladies et me hear you scream
Hate on me much as you want to
You can't do What the fuck I do
Bitches be emulating me daily
Hate on me much as you want to
You can't be Who the fuck I be
Bitches be imitating me lately

Come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me

Mariah Carey,"I can't help it
When I'm not around you (Boy)
'Cause all I ever seem to
Do is drift away
In dreams about you
'Cause when I'm without you (Boy)
It always seems like
Part of me is missing baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up
And makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all

(Boy) I need you
(Boy) Adore you (Boy)
Gotta have you (Oh boy)
I want to feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Feeling you (Boy)
Fiending for you (Boy)
Just waiting on you (Boy)
When I see you (Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy

My Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
'Cause when I know
You're thinking of me (Boy)
Heaven knows
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby

Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all

I should've left it at
I like your music too, and
I should've never called you back
When you pursued me
I should've never given you
My fucking N two way
I should've never listened
To your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you
Told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated
We were lovers
When you know very well
We never even touched each other

It all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down...
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down

I gotta break it to ya delicately, dunny
Takin' my g5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'
But I guess you wouldn't know
That's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully
Overblown
You don't want the world to know
That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
(Boo hoo. Who?)

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bankroll runs out

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Nobody cares when the tears of a clown

Fall down

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and

Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out

Couldn't love ever be
Something tangible and real
Farewell, fair weather friend
Abandonment returns to taunt me again

I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life
For the first time
I only wanted you to be there when I
Opened up my eyes

I was caught in your masquerade
Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil
But it just seemed so easy to
Open up myself to you
Once more into the wind
The embers scatter
And the chill settles in

I only wanted you to stay

Mariah Carey,"At night as we lay down to sleep
I wonder what you'll show me
I think of you
and the thoughts that you keep
And I, I wonder do you know me
Everything that I have
is broken in two
Everything that I am
revolves around you
And you just don't understand
What a girl goes through

Everyone believes in something
Though we give it different names
You can search the world for that one thing
But it's all the same

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

As the moon rides away from the sun
She takes all his light and reflects it
I relate them to us just for fun
There's a parallel that's unexpected
Every star in the sky,
reminds me of you
Twinkling in my eyes,
The way that you do
And I don't know why
I get so blue

Everyday is filled with changes
No matter where you go
Living in a world of strangers
So we go for what we know

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Everyone believes in something
But it's all the same
Attitude will keep me going
So I guess I can't complain

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Mariah Carey,"I've still got a lot to learn
But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long
(As I know all things are possible)
Just as long as I believe

I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fear
With no end in sight
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
Been destitute
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatized
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
I found my saving grace within you

And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you
For delivering me

And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you keep me safe
Always my saving grace
Pulls me through
I found my saving grace within you

Within you...

That I can't help
Want to get a little closer

That I would never give my heart
Away again

Butcha gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get

Ain't worth it

I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel

See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do
Anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I, know everyone out there can relate
So the question is
One: do I really want to trust this feeling
Two: do I want to let it pass me by
Three: do you think it's only superficial
Four: could it actually be different this time

Someone to be my everything

Mariah Carey,"See it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved on

So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on

If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in

And in my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so

Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently

If you really need me (yeah:.)

You don't ever have to be (like you used to)
Downhearted again
(before I even knew you)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(then you know I'm singing to you)
Baby all you ever need to do
(so I just wanted you to know)
Is call me and let love rush in
(that ""anytime you need a friend"")

If you really need me (I'm here)
Baby just reach out and touch me
(you can still believe
You don't ever have to be in fairy tales)
Downhearted again (yours and mine)
If she hurts you or misleads you
(so if by chance you take a listen)

Mariah Carey,"Well it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me

We used to be close
(but you didn't love me)
We used to be best friends
(but you never really cared)
I let you into my soul
(didn't know you couldn't be trusted)
It took me so long to forget
(all the little things we shared)

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance

Where were you when I needed you most
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart

And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry boy, but you had your chance",You Had Your Chance
Mariah Carey,"You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

Tender love's what you're giving me and
You surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much

'Cause I know how it feels to be
Part of you boy
Everyday of my life's so abundant
With joy
And I honestly never thought love
Could be real
Until the angels guided you to me

You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

I never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
Now that I can share it with someone

Baby our love will always persevere
Anything you ever need,
You know I'll be right here and
You don't have to worry boy

I won't betray your trust
Because I'm so much in love
Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time

And if you lost everything
I'd keep on standing by your side
And boy it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love
Because I can't get enough

Mariah Carey,"You know me well,we go too far back
How could anyone else compete with that
So I just can't help feelin' sentimental
'Bout this in our past

We promised to keep it casual
But at times it can be so difficult
This relationship, so untypical
And I can't understand
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love ma and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

[Chorus]
There goes my heart again
Baby why can't we be just friends
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again

When I fell you stare catching me off-guard
Boy it's just not fair, 'cause you know for sure
How to lure me in with that magnetic smile
Tell me why, tell me why

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, it's so deceiving
Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend

First you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms

There goes my heart again (No, no, no)

We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road
I'm hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggrevated
Walk around frustrated
Ya patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

Hey yo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most
Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
But when we sex we tease
In a passionate way
I love the way you touch it
Those little elaborate ways
Got the guard feelin' released
To relax for the day
It's on you ma

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want

And how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment
To talk the truth to you
Listen, I'm never home
I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigga-ma-ro
I never meant to put a thousand pounds
Of stress on ya head
I love the way we sleep
And always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience
Sheddin' ya tears with me
I ask you my mami
Please continue to bear with me

We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from Lucy's and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me
Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats ya ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world you never leave me
Fall back ma I'll make ya lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things ya do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter you'll never do me greasy

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

I'm talkin' bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby won't you come here 'cause I'm really in need
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us, think about how much

I knew I'd never be the same again (this part's sexy right here)
Why can't it just be like it was (yeah)
Enough is enough (yo)

Uh, uh huh
Yo, I remember when I first kicked it to you
We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you
It was all swell
Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what (uh huh, yeah)
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up
Past hot, we was more like lava-ble (uh huh)
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours (wooo)
When I thought you was able to cope
That's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy
While all the time in your mind, you knew I was feeling you crazy
But Kiss is official boo and I'mma come clean 
You miss me, well I miss you too, come on

Mariah Carey,"When you get caught in the rain with no where to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
What you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And when the rain blows, as shadows grow close don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day
And I can make it through the rain, ooh yes you can

I feel good, satisfied

You've got me feelin' emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feelin' emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied

But I like the way I feel inside

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feelin' emotions

You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside

I'd risk my life to feel your body next to mine

I can see you clearly vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far like a distant star I'm wishing on tonight

Mariah Carey,"When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be safe but nobody comes
And you feel so far away that you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

And when the wind blows, as shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day and night
I can make it through the rain

And how we used to shine

Forever we'd both regret

You keep on blowin' my mind
You keep on makin' me high
Keep giving me butterflies and
Every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See, I'm just breakin' it down

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine boy
I'm on a tangent

Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

Oh it's hard to make believe
It's just a casual thing
You're so unnerving to me
Feels like I'm living a dream, but
Baby please don't wake me up
I'm lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I'm right where I wanna be

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can't imagine boy
I'm on tangent

Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby

But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively

Jumped in your ride and took off

Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home

Holding hands with someone new

Mariah Carey,"Baby baby don't you ever let go
More and more until we both overflow
Got a feeling that my heart's never known
I found love
Tender kisses and I'm floating on air
You can have me anytime, anywhere
When you need me I will always be there
I found love

And our love goes round and round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love

Loving you is like a taste of heaven
want to gaze into your eyes forever
Run away and spend our lives together
I've found love
Baby baby
All it takes is one touch
And immediately I feel a rush
Baby boy, too much is never enough
I found love

And our love goes round and round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love

I don't need anything
When you're here next to me
Nobody in this whole wide world
Could ever replace you in my eyes
We found paradise
Forever you and I
Our love goes round and round
On a joy ride
(With ya babe, with ya babe,
With ya babe, with you baby)",Joy Ride
Mariah Carey,"I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

It's irrelevant to dwell on the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
Cause I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

No, no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We weren't made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back to
Life
Maybe you could be mine",Mine Again
Mariah Carey,"I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

I'm riding home in pain again, baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged
In an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say ""Players only love you
When they're playing games""
Still, I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away
Like my friends all told me to

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high
When he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only

Now you know I roll a Beamer and a Benz 
And I'm dishin' out N's 
While you trippin' on a playa
Baller, havin' bitter conversations 
While we're rollin' on 24's 
And I know you got doubts 
Why you listen to what people talk about
You ain't figured out why they call ya 
The heavy steady hatin' cause 
You rollin' on 24's 
See how your money flows
You dress in designer clothes 
From head to the toe
You ain't satisfied, well tell me 
What you lookin' for

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, I'll be your one and only 
If you give me a chance
I'll make the change for you, girl 
I know I ain't been the most faithful 
Nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spittin it to ya while I roll a shisha of fire
To kiss your lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a 
Grip on the tire 

I'm lookin' for my one and only

Well, come on Shorty, let me make it better 
We can do whatever 
While we're sittin' on suede and leather 
Thinkin' through the city 
While we rollin' lonely 
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with ya, I ain't gon' lie
I know you were feelin' 
You really know your guy 
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high 
Let me pick the pieces up 
And put them back together cause I want to be with you 
Don't want to leave you lonely
Ride with you like a homey, never, no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only

Every time, oh mm
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
Why I'm looking for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only
Still lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground so, so lonely
Yeah, I'm lookin' for my one and only
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around ah, ha ha ha ha
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Why can't I find my one and only, ah",One and Only

Now get buck wild
Shhh, don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go round and round
Do you want me to

Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I gotta shake you off

Of your dirty little deeds

By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time

I'm never coming back home

And saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm
And lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
want to hold you close
And feel your love inside
But I don't want to play myself
Cause I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't want to fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind

You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you till the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love

Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me to break away from you baby
Never could resist you
And I still haven't learned how
And I don't want to be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
Cause I don't want to miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute

I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better

You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine

So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny

Forever we'd both regret

I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets

Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'm a hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

You wasn't worth my time
I've leaving you behind
'Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because

I'm never coming back home
Baby I'm gone
Don't cha know

Mariah Carey,"Its ya boy twista
That girl Mariah
This that fiyah

I've been need of lover when back in the dark and
Sometimes wish you was wit me
Talking a little on the phone about what everybody's saying
All the things they tell me
Cause I know inside we belong to each other incidentally
I'm need of healin'
You're the only one who gives me that feelin'

You know I like the way you kick it girl
You know I like it when ya in my world
Come here lil' momma let me freak yo body
Then roll wit me in the Bentley White pearl
Girl you know you get me so erotic
Especially when I be sipping hypnotic
Got me feeling like I'm smoking on chronic
When we fucking it be so exotic
Now I know that I be turning on fiyay Wit Mariah
And she know she be dealing wit a balla
Can't go fast cause I'm heavy through the wire
Fulfillin' desires like a chi shot calla
Do you love how the twist throw it at you
Do you love when I hit it from the back too
Let me feel how you work it that one way
Come on baby girl let me see what that do

I wish that we could
Blow out the speakers
Over N Over
To them Jodeci cuts
""Forever your lady""
You act right then maybe
Ain't nothing to talk about
Put the music loud
So they won't hear me say
Ah-ha ha ah!
Come and be my one and only
Tired of being so lonely, come hold me
Ah-ha ha ah!
I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say
Ah-ha ha ah!
Come be my one & only
Tired of being so lonely, console me
Ah-ha ha ah!
I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say

Now we pulling up out the garage
In the platinum blue arnage
Me and you about to hit that club
To the bar so we can sip that bud
Both of us together we would be the livest
If I had to break it down how would I describe it
(Ah- ah oh!)
We the type of couple when we get up on each other
We get it cracking in the kitchen or the bedroom
It don't matter where we at we be making noise
So play the track so the base will make ya head boom
Break ya off when here one leg up
And you know I like the way you put it on me
It's the east coast queen and the mid west Mob Boss?
Shorty I will never leave ya lonely

I wish that we could
Blow out the speakers
Over N Over
To them Jodeci cuts
""Forever your lady""
You act right then maybe
Ain't nothing to talk about
Put the music loud
So they won't hear me say

I wanna wrap myself around you whenever you want to
Come make me say

Tired of being so lonely, console me
Ah-ha ha ah!
I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say

So just show a girl what it do (What it do)
After this boy I promise to do
You got my body lit up like the moon
You're too persuasive, I can't take it,
I'm so caught up in you

Ah-ha ha ah!

I'm tired of being so lonely, come hold me
Ah-ha ha ah!

Mariah Carey,"I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips

Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny
So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be M-C

Mariah Carey,"Baby, when you look my way
You keep on blowin’ my mind
You keep on makin’ me high
Keep giving me butterflies

And every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See I’m just breakin’ it down

You got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can’t imagine, boy
I’m on a tangent

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out

Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my mind
‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And I don’t know, don’t know what to do

Oh, it’s hard to make believe
It’s just a casual thing
You’re so unnerving to me
Feels like I’m living a dream

But baby, please don’t wake me up
I’m lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I’m right where I wanna be

You got everything I need, just
Want you to want me, you
Just can’t imagine, boy
I’m on a tangent

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out

Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my mind
‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And I don’t know, don’t know what to do

I don’t care ‘bout nothing but you, baby
(Nothing but you, baby)
I don’t care ‘bout nothing but you, baby

‘Cause I’m sprung over you
And ain’t nothing I can do

Keep you under glass

I must open up my hands 
And watch you rise

Spread your wings and prepare to fly 
For you have become a butterfly 
Fly abandonedly into the sun 
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be 
So spread your wings and fly

I have learned that beauty 
Has to flourish in the light 
Wild horses run unbridled 
Or their spirit dies 
You have given me the courage 
To be all that I can 
And truly feel your heart will 
Lead you back to me when you're 
Ready to land 

[Chorus]

I can't pretend these tears 
Aren't over flowing steadily 
I can't prevent this hurt from 
Almost overtaking me 
ButI will stand and say goodbye 
For you'll never be mine 
Until you know the way it feels to fly

So flutter through the sky

Spread your wings and fly

Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Ahhh

They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother

I see you with your favorite dress on again
I guess you thought that you were slick
But I already peeped
You got your tag tucked in
You're strugglin'
Tryin' to look cute in your best friend's boots
But they don't hardly fit
Why you back again
Tryin' to steal my man
I told you once before but
You don't hear me
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no
Sho ain't the one
Sho ain't the one
I ain't the one

All these J.O.'s want what's mine
But they done lost their mind
They on him like the ice cream man,
Night and day
Why I got to fight to keep 'em all away
They crammin' but they know
They can't have none
Obsessin' but they're messin' with the wrong one

I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

You think I won't come out these heels
And make it clear
I ain't the one
You think I won't fuck up my hair
And take it there
I ain't the one
Keep your hands up off my boo
Ain't no telling what I'll do
What makes you think you fly enough to
Take my man, no

Can't sleep on this heat don't bother
They said I couldn't come no harder
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother

I wish that you was here to celebrate together
I wish that we can spend the holidays together
I remember when you use to tuck me in at night
Or the teddy bear you give me I held so tight
I thought you were so strong
You make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you gone forever

I never knew I can hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like this
I wish I can talk to you for a while
I miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by

And I'm sure you reached a better place
And I'd still give
The world is in your face
Me right here, next to you
But it's like your gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say
Bye, bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye, bye-bye

This is for my people's who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put you hand way up high
You will never say bye
(No no no)
Momma's, daddy's, sister's, brother's
Friends, and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head up to the sky
'Cause we will never say bye

I never knew I can hurt like this
(I never knew it) and everyday (everyday I wish that I)
Life goes on like this (I wish, I wish)
I wish I can talk to you for a while (I wish)
I miss you but I try not to cry (I wish)
As time goes by (As time goes bye)

And I'm sure you reached a better place
And still I'd give
The world to see your face
Me right here, next to you
But it's like your gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say
Bye, bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye, bye-bye

'Cause this is for my peoples that
Just lost somebody (bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye)
This is for everybody (bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye)
Just lift your head to the sky (bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye)
'Cause we will never say bye-bye",Bye Bye
Mariah Carey,"Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it but it's somethin 'bout him
Makin' me high
Like a motor revin' over and over
It don't stop
He cruised beside me now
I'm flyin', drivin'

Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101
Slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy
With some cruise control
No, no, no

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
(But uh ooh)
I can't resist 'em
Just want to kiss 'em
I need cruise control

Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain

(Wherever I go he be cruisin'
Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it
Deep down inside don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control)

C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control

Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes in to view
'Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin'
On me avenue
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say no man
Step up step up bottle broken
Think I'm jokin'

I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But uh ooh
I can't resist 'em
Just want to kiss 'em

Turn to the right ooh he so smooth with it
Deep down inside don't want to lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control

You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want (why you always)
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis

Might need to go slow, I don't know
Why ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night

Mariah Carey,"For the record
You oughta know
You wasn't thinking
When you let me go

But whatever
That's how it goes
Win some you lose some
And others you hold in your heart

Why it gets so hard
Tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go
No, no, no

Suddenly you're here
And it's so surreal
And I don't know
What the deal

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind

I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (one time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

Them other irregularities
They can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me

People see ya know
Asking all about
Me and how they always thought we
Were so perfect together

Let's re-write the end
Start over again
And it's gon go better now

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time

For the record
You'll always be a part of me
No matter what you do
And for the record
Can't nobody say
I didn't give my all to you

And for the record
I told you underneath the stars
That you belong to me
For the record
It's obvious that
We just can't let go of us, honey

'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind

Mariah Carey,"Oh baby
(Baby, I stay in love with you)

Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up
Can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is baby
I try and try so hard
To keep our love alive

If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's no mistaking
We're just erasing
From our hearts and minds

And I know we said let go
But I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over
You're really gone
It's killing me
'Cause there ain't nothing
That I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around
And I try to front like ""oh well""
Each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now
No matter what I do
But baby, baby
I stay in love with you

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
(Baby, I stay in love with you)

It cuts so deep
It hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me
I ain't the same no more
We still need each other
When we stumble and fall
How we gon' act
Like what we had
Ain't nothin' at all now

Hey, what I wanna do is
Ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to
Hit the block
Proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes
I can't last one moment alone
Now go I know

And I know we said let go
But I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over
You're really gone
It's killing me
'Cause there ain't nothing
That I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you

And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around

Oh, I stay in love (I stay in love with you)
I stay in love",I Stay in Love
Mariah Carey,"This goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are

When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
Didn't you, didn't you feel so cold
You against the world in a losing fight (a losing fight)
Captive of your demons inside

So you sought an enemy
(I'm not your enemy)
Like times before to mock ignorantly (he lives in you, you know it's true)
(But the Lord said love, love your enemy so just)
Take heed to the word it's time
Check Proverbs 19:29
Don't cry

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then
(So much I didn't see)
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be
I'll keep you in prayer 'till the end

Still bruised, still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself
(Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you)
But you can't manipulate me like before
Examine first John chapter four verse four

And I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Be strong in the Lord and power of His might

If my shows of gratitude are minuscule
Inside your mind, sorry
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)
(There's only so much I can do) I love you and did all that I could

Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate

I know you've been there for me plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Philippians 4:9
(Put it into practice)

So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

(He who the Son sets free is free indeed)
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know

But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify
To small and great alike
So the more you curse me
The more you're blessing me
The Word said it
Love your enemies

Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129:2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me

I wish you well

He will keep them in perfect peace)",I Wish You Well

Picture you in my mind

(Let's talk 'bout love, won't end, won't end)

This is my love story
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire
Off they go roller-coaster ride
Up and down and around
Twisted all out they minds
And then his friends
Said ""its too soon to settle down""
And then her friends
Said ""he's a playa, slow it down""
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love
Wasn't on their side

But this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
They'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up
Like that Casablanca movie, no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly ours for the eternity
They'll be no end to our love story baby

(Ay bay bay it won't end, won't end, won't end)

There's no end to our love story
Chapter two
When they meet up again
Second time around
See but they're just friends
But the feelings still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like
Ay bay bay
Let's meet up today
Got's bout an hour or two
You might as well come through

We can make it like it was
Just the two of us
Back up on that roller-coaster
Like we been supposed to

Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
They'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon end up

This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly ours for the eternity
They'll be no end to our love story baby

Just when it seemed
Like all the odds
Were stacked against them
They came back stronger then before
Matter fact then some
Stronger then pride
Lookin' like them
Lookin' like her, lookin' like him
Stronger then hate
And the whole world too
Lookin' like me
Lookin' like you

'Cause this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real

Click in Shawntae and Mae-Mae (hey)
Treat it as a holiday
'Cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

See I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah they fit
But it might benefit
Me to throw something on
To feature my hips
Accentuate my ****
And steal the show

Fellas be grabbin' at us like yo
Tryin' to get us going off the Patron

Got a flow that'll flex yo tire
Got stacks plus I'm back with Mariah

We stay down like flour flats 
On the Cadillac 
Packed to the back 
With four phat girls
If you feel like doin' a dance
I'm gonna pull up my dance girl
Come on back girl

But I gotta migrate to bar
From the bar to the flo'
From the flo' to the car
From the car to the crib
Then back to the club
We can migrate in that
Mini coupe sittin' on dubs

Whatcha waitin' on
I can't stand in one place
I'm on that platinum and that Patron
And I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks
Or you gon' dehydrate

Tell it to me like it ain't okay
We can move this back to my place

Tryin' to get us going off the Patron

Another hit, okay
We lookin' fine, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday
Monday, Tuesday (haha)
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me

I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me

Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much

More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room
Inside this private hell we built
And I dealt with it like a kid
I wished I could fly away but instead

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreamin' 'bout the violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people
That I let inside
Still a little defensive
Thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed
Inside I fake a smile and deal with the

Side effects
Side effects
Side effects
Side effects

Vacant inside no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while put up a fight
It's just too much night after night

After a while I would just lie
You were dead wrong said you were right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life

Flickering like a candle
Doin' my best to handle
Sleepin with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering
Every last part of me
So I broke away and finally
Found the strength to breathe

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're with
Misery love company so we ain't tryin' to hang with y'all

In the streets havin' laughs

Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
And lost the will to fight

And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me is languishing
And I'm too frozen to run

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

'Cause, you see
I've got a lot to dream
There's more than this for me

An angel lands with broken wings
He warms me with his eyes
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart
Unravels as he smiles

See I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learn to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again

And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know I'm gonna be fine, that's right

'Cause, for real
I've got a right to dream

There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You you you baby

Oh all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby

Just let you leave without a trace,
When I'm standing taking every breath,
With you, ooohhh,
You're the only one who really knew me, 
At all.

How can you just walk away from me, 
When all I can do is watch you leave,
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain,
And even shared the tears,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
There's just an empty space,
If you're coming back to me it's against the odds,
And that's what I've got to face.

I wish I could just make you turn around,
Turn around and see me cry,
There's so much I need to say to you,
So many reasons why,
You're the only one who really knew me at all.

So take a look at me now,
There's just an empty space,
There's nothing left here to remind me,
Just the memory of your face,
So take a look at me now, 
So there's just an empty space,
But to wait for you is all I can do,
When that's what I've got to face.

Take a good look at me now,
Cause I'll be standing here,

And you coming back to me is against the odds,
And that's the chance I've got to take.

Mariah Carey,"Many nights we prayed 
With no proof anyone could hear 
In our hearts a hope for a song 
We barely understood 
Now we are not afraid 
Although we know there's much to fear 
We were moving mountains 
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe 
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

In this time of fear 
When prayer so often proves in vain 
Hope seems like the summer bird 
Too swiftly flown away 
Yet now I'm standing here 
My hearts so full, I can't explain 
Seeking faith and speaking words 
I never thought I'd say 
There can be miracles 
When you believe (When you believe) 

Though hope is frail 
It's hard to kill 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve) 
When you believe somehow you will 
You will when you believe 

They don't always happen when you ask 
And it's easy to give in to your fears 
But when you're blinded by your pain 
Can't see the way, get through the rain 
A small but still, resilient voice 
Says hope is very near, oh 

There can be miracles (Miracles) 
When you believe (Boy, when you believe, yeah)
Though hope is frail (Though hope is frail, it's hard)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh, yeah) 
Who knows what miracles 
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh) 
When you believe somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow) 
Somehow you will (I know, I know, know) 
You will when you believe (When you)
You will when you (You will when you believe)

Mariah Carey,(Angels cry),Angel (The Prelude)
Mariah Carey,"I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you'd say
We could've made everything okay, but we just
Threw the blame back and forth, we treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low, I'm still on the ground

I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all, remember we
Used to touch the sky
And lighting don't strike
The same place twice, when you and I
Said goodbye I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift,
But we let it drift in a storm
Every night I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

Limitless omnipresent, kind of love
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop and disappear
In a whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope wobbling
But won't let go, waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow

I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane it's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine

'Cause lighting don't strike, the same place twice
When you and i, said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, but we let it drift, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

C'mon babe, can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge, just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry

Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (don't let our love)
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you (baby I'm missin' you)
Baby, I'm missin' you, don't allow love to lose (you can)
We gotta ride it through, (we gotta ride it)
I'm reaching for you (and I'm gonna say)

Ou lighting don't strike, the same place twice
You and i, said goodbye, felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip, in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Oh babe don't let the angels cry",Angels Cry
Mariah Carey,"Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I can't believe you just actually did this **** to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred
Mascara runnin'
Laughing out of anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroom

Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

And you see your whole world collapse
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh
I'm a la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face boy
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels

So I pulled to the side
Of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up
What my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze
Morning dew and sun rays
As I drive I hide my eyes
Behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house
Slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door
But you're there wide awake
You like ""where you been?""
I'm like ""sorry""
I fell asleep of Jasmine's sofa
I coulda swore that Ray Ray
Called you and told ya""
You like ""you okay""
I'm like ""I'm alright
Little sleep and I'll be fine""
But if you only knew
What was in the back of my mind
You already stung
But you really goin' find out in time

Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha goin' know oh how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real
60 minutes for real

(Baby) I had all my trust in you
And look at what you put me through
(You got me all crazy) somewhere down the line
Your goin' get what you deserve you f***ing jerk
Your were supposed to save me, my sweet baby
Now we are (fading away) but your gonna know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do",Betcha Gon' Know (The Prologue)
Mariah Carey,"I still remember
That hazy September
I've been waiting for somebody like you
To come back around

We would walk in the park
Every Saturday
Brand new
All in love
Kissing time away
You was all up on me
It was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple thing
Anklets, Nameplates
That you gave to me
Sweet tarts, ring pops, and that candy bling
And you were my world

Now I wish I could go back and make time stop
I would take this love throwback from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm a think about you all night long

Back in the days we were in love
Were not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
Were not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again

It was personal things we would do
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missing you

My sweet baby
My sweet thang
Like candy
Felt like real love
Not just play play
Missing you
My sweet baby

It was everything that I could do
To stay awake
And I often reminisce
About the games we played
It was Tag, Chess, Spin The Bottle
Then butterflies would last 'till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home

And now I wish I
Could go back and my time stop (stop, stop, stop)
And I would take this love throwback from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm a think about you all night long

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I still wishing we was in one again

It was personal things we would do
Fall asleep on the phone and skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missing you

My sweet baby
My sweet thang
Like candy
Felt like real love
Not just play play
Missing you
My sweet baby

I'm a see Mimi
Felt the need to change me
Butterfly flow
Like Mohamed Ali
Wish I can bring you back
Like the O.D.B
Thinkin' bout the world
Plus me you and Jack
No matter what I do
Well the memories are stacked
Thinkin' tenth grade
Thinkin' 'bout eleventh
When you went doggy fresh
All the way to heaven heaven heaven

Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I sit and wish we was in one again
Back in the days we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days
I still wishing we was in one again

Back in the days, still remember
Now I'm back in the, now I'm stack in my future missing you

My sweet thang
Like candy
Felt like real love
Not just play play

Mariah Carey,"Once upon a time
We swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us
And we changed
And you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairy tale just end up this way?

We went round for round
Til' we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

This was all a phenomenon that no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind
And watch us every night
Want to pause it but I can't make it stay

We went 'round for 'round
'Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring
Not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, ooh

No need to call my phone
'Cause I changed my number today
And matter fact I think I'm moving away (away)
Sorry the frustrations got me feelin' a way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just want to hold you, touch you, feel you
Be near you, I miss you babe babe babe (babe babe babe)
I am tired of tryin' to fake through
But there is nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you

I can't wait to hate you
Make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you
Break you down so low that there's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you baby ooh

I can't wait to hate you
But right now I need you
I can't wait to hate you
I can't wait to hate you
But right now I need you",H.A.T.E.U.

Would you cry for me?
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe

Those ancient buried recollections
We transform them and select them
You have yours, I have mine
That's fine
While we're too torn to heal
Our stitch has never disappeared
I have mine, you have yours
I'm sure

We can make love in Italy in the grotto
Fresh off the jet, got the men they screaming bravo

Steppin' in my Jimmy Choo's
Yeah, I got it all cute for you, baby
Nothin' like them other girls

Boy, until the end

Boy, you got me all mixed up like Cerrato
You got me spinnin' 'round for you like a little model
Steady feenin' for you like them fries at McDonalds
I want to be all on your lips like gelato (ice cream)
Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso
Love me down 'til I hit the top of my soprano
We can pop bottles while we talkin' on the phone
(Then, baby, come and pluck this thing like a cello, cello, cello)

Steppin' in my Chrissy Liu's
Yeah, I got it all cute for you baby
Nothin' like them other girls,
I would never be rude to you baby

(More than just friends)
Boy, until the end

Who's gonna speak and start off this thing
Is it you?
Is it me?
We should say how we feel for each other
Baby boo, I need your touch
Never wanted somethin' so much
Friendship just ain't enough
Boy, I want to be with you until the end

Take a look at my bags baby (when I break I break I break)

And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

Mariah Carey,"We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world

Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near

Such spirit through the year

Such spirit through the year",Charlie Brown Christmas
Mariah Carey,"Christmas time is in the air again
Christmas chimes reminding me of
When we fell like the snow
So deep in love
High above us the evergreens
Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze
As we made future Christmas memories

Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile
'Cause the mistletoe is occupied
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer with you all year
And not wait till the morning
When Christmas time is in the air again

Mr. Grinch simply can't resist
Warming up when he looks our way
Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish
For a honey to hold Christmas day

And to feel love like ours always
La da da, da da dum

And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer
With you all throughout the year
And not wait till the morning

On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Mariah Carey,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now

You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve

But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

So I hope Rudolph and them all the eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up
And scoop him right down my chimney

I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
Make this Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on oh Kris Kringle send me help

But I believe in you Saint Nick

Mariah Carey,"An angel appeared
Of the highest one
And Mary believed
The word she received
Of God's only son
The virgin rejoiced
Gave thanks to the Lord
And as Joseph dreamt
The angel was sent
With tidings of piece and joy
Of the blessed baby boy

They traveled for miles
To reach Bethlehem
Yet when they arrived
No one could provide
Place at the inn for them
But God kept them safe
From hurt, harm and danger
In his warm embrace
Away in a manger
Waiting for Jesus' birth
To glorify the earth
Then he came

One child can change the world
Christmas morn'
The king of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

Oh, wondrous star
Led shepherds and wise men
Through valleys and mountains
Angels surrounded them
As they traveled far
As heaven and home
Rang out for the savior
The sweet prince of peace
Lay majestively
Asleep glorious and pure
And his mercy endures for always

One child can change the world
Christmas morn'
The king of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord

One child can change the world
On Christmas morn'
The king of all kings was born

Someday it might be enough
To heal each other

And we gon' get together
And rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world
Become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout
Because the savior reigns
So don't dismay

Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love
Lasts forever

Soon as Christmas comes

It's gon' be alright

Oh what fun, hmm

And we gon' reminisce about
The good old days
And we gon' laugh together as
The children play
And through the years is always
Gonna be this way

Mariah Carey,"Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've give you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't want to cry

I don't want to cry
Don't want to cry
Nothing in the world
Could take us back

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)

They told me get 'em, I got 'em,
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I ain't never asked for no handouts
You won't carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they ain't mad at me,
I'm on fire and I'm gon' burn
And they ain't gon' learn,
I remember they said that it ain't my turn
But it ain't confirmed, then the table's turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I ain't gon' stop, 'cause I'm gon' climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Path that I choose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell tryin' to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it's hundreds and millions, this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the born achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby still know who you are
So you gotta keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the rope
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
(Get 'em, get 'em, get em)
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
(Stay on your toes)
Don't let 'em ever count you out
(No, no, no, no)

Mariah Carey,"Hey, hey
You're almost home
You're almost home
You're almost home

I've seen the light in the sky
In the skies are like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark

I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom, I'm believing in my heart
Cause underneath the good there's something greater than you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from, it's like some other universe
You count your steps, like they're regrets
You catch one breath then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn

So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you let your heart be the compass
You won't get lost, not if you trust it
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before

Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Cause you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home

When you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
Almost there
You're almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home",Almost Home
Mariah Carey,"I'm making a statement of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember
I no longer live in your dominion (no, no, no, ooh)
You're just trifling, nothing more than a liability
Got up and laid all your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now

Letting go, letting go ain't easy
Oh, it's just exceedingly hurtful
'Cause somebody you used to know
It's flinging your world around
And they watch, as you're falling down, down, down
Falling down, baby

Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won't subside

Mariah Carey,"I remember so many nights in the bed alone
Wonderin' could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold (cold)
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that's alright
'Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself, it's fine

I camouflage my tears and you wear your disguise
And I then go
to know that you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)

Wear it sometimes when I try to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talk to me
Kept praying inside let him love me for who I am
Please my Lord (please my Lord)
But you where just somewhere the sun couldn't reach
Couldn't understand

I camouflage my tears and you wear your disguise
And I then go
to know that you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me (I need to know, say that you do)

Didn't we swear we give each other everything
Didn't I give you all of me
Oh oh oh
No night or day goes by
No no no
When I, don't wonder inside
If you feel the way you used to feel

I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And ran, and ran, I flow

(I need to know, say that you do)
And that's all I really wanted
that's all I really wanted
(Oh say it)
that's all I really wanted
Tell me that you love me
I need to know (I need to know)
Say that you love me (I camouflage)

Cry, cry (cry), cry, cry

Maybe I didn’t leave much between us that day
And maybe I shouldn’t have told you I loved you
Played the game, and now I understand
Wish I could have you back
And kiss you soft and feel your hands on me

Til we both break down
Til we both break down
Til we both break down
And cry

Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry

And maybe I didn’t give you your space back then
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer
But I was seduced by you, and I didn't know enough
Truly too enchanted to disregard the words you said to make me yours
I need to hold you until we break

Til we both break down (break down)
Til we both break down
I should have known that you were trying to love me
Oh til we both break down and cry

Oh my love, imprudently I left every cell in me
So naked, somewhere at the core of you
Bless our souls

I just need you til we both (Til we both break down)
I'm just saying
Til we both break down
Might as well tell the truth about the matter (til we both break down)
Guess it's selfish of me to just expect that I'm entitled to have you)
But tonight all I wanna do is just hold you (til we both break down)

It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you but that was then
I can't forget
My heart's hungover but ain't nothing different
I closed my eyes nothing but faded pictures of you, of you

Faded, baby, you're faded
Baby you're faded, faded

You come, you go, you're just an echo
Whisper in my ear, but in the morning you're not here
So intangible, just like an echo

Still try to pretend it's possible
To bring us back to life
Boy we continue to subside
Hanging on for life like on this roller-coaster ride
I call your name baby subconsciously
Always somewhere, but you're not there for me
Boy you, boy you, faded, baby, you're faded
Baby you're faded, faded
Boy you just come and you go

And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car

Rolled down all the windows, just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this, happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when I get you back)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when we fade to black)
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

Before we both get loud, I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house, me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot, after taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know, I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, ""What have you done to me?""
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy, she must have put something in my drink, uh
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she come down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there

Girl you know I know how it looks
(See I know how it looks)
Baby you know I know how it looks
(But baby it ain't like that)
Girl you know I know how it looks eh eh eh eh
So don't go accusing me of something
That I didn't really mean to do

This is for real, for real, for real (no)
Oprah Winfrey whole segment, for real, for real (no)
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no)
60 Minutes for real

(Baby)
I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through
(You got me all crazy) (this is not my fault, no know it baby)
Somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk
(Your were supposed to save me) you were supposed to save me (I'ma love you)
Oh sweet baby (I don't love her, no)
(Fading away) (don't fade, don't fade, no)
But you gon' know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do

Mariah Carey,"On the back cover of this album is a personal treasure
This is my first and only self-portrait
I drew it when I was three and a half and entitled it
""Me. I Am Mariah.""
Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title
Come on, I was only three and a half

It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken
I've kept this drawing private for so long
But because this album is a reflection
of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care
And have been here for me through it all
I've been through a lot, but I've always known me
I am Mariah

Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas
Lately, they've been calling me
""The Elusive Chanteuse""
I like it",Me. I Am Mariah...The Elusive Chanteuse

Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you don’t already know

Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity

How I say this, fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, ""Who is this?""
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments
Ain’t no being friends
Ain’t no false pretense
Ain’t no make amends
Ain’t no come agains
That’s the story, ain’t no happy ends

Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity

Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like you’re so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe

Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.

Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my

Marian Farias Gomez,"Lastima bandoneón, mi corazón
Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva

Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente

Looking at the street lights
Since I been without you
Had a lot of late nights

I don’t miss you tugging my sleeve
I don’t need your hand on my cheek
I don’t think about you before I fall asleep

Playing with my skirt

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz

How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

That night in Berkeley square.",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square
Marian McPartland,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

Marian McPartland,"My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
But you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

Don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is valentine's day",My Funny Valentine [Live]
Marian McPartland,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

I could live without love

Gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count your fingers what can you do
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Marian McPartland,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Marian McPartland,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

I never knew what they could do.

Marian McPartland,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Marian McPartland,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Marian McPartland,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Marian McPartland,"Hark! the herald angels sing, -

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I'll tell you no lie

Marian Montgomery,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin',
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out.
Give me the simple life.

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant.
Those things roll off my knife,
Just serve me tomatoes, and mashed potatoes,
Give me the simple life.

A cottage small is all I'm after,
Not one that's spacious and wide.
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside.

Some like the high road, I like the low road,
Free from the care and strife.
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed-y,
Give me the simple life.",Give Me the Simple Life
Marian Montgomery,"I can't believe that you're not here with me
To have a laugh or share a tear with me
It's all so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

To never see your funny face again
To never thrill to your embrace again
Oh, it's so wrong it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

Those midnight suppers for two
Our silly duets at dawn
Those crazy moments with you
Don't tell me that they are gone

To never look into those eyes again
The sun might just as well not rise again
Oh no, no, no, it can't be right
It must have been something I dreamed last night

I've set the table and a plate for you
Making believe you will soon be here
I watched the dawn sit and wait for you

Marian Montgomery,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,
Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
Will still be whispering, whispering.

That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You
Marian Montgomery,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

So if you see them anywhere

Me partes el alma, me dejas sin nada

Porque si tu no me quieres
Si ya no es lo mismo

Y aun que me hagas falta no vuelvo contigo

Ya paso que quede claro no hay rencor
Se acabo si es que algún día comenzó
Mírame y aun que te quedes en silencio
Mejor me voy antes de que me partas el alma

Y quedarme ciega caminar descalsa 
Que a mi piel la queme un millón de brasas 
Pero nunca tu, no me faltes tu 

Como quisiera con mi canto 
Deslumbrarte esta canción los oídos 
Acostumbrarte 
Hablar con dios de frente a frente 
Para tenerte por todas mis noches 
Buenas para quererte 
Renaceria por ti 
Todas mis mañana pro ti todas mis 
Angustias olvidaria 
Y gastaria con tigo aquellas monedas 
Que desde niño he guardado en una alcancia 
Sere tus ojos mi mejor cancion 
Vivire a diario por ti un horacion 
Para que tu seas siempre mi hombre fiel 
Y sientas mi amor corriendo por tu piel 

Que me falte el agua 
Que me falte el viento 
Que me falte todo lo que aun no tengo 
Pero nunca tu, no me faltes tu 
Que me falte el aire para respirar 
O que me falte el alma si la quiere dios 
Que me falte un años para envejecer 
Pero que nunca me faltes tu

Mariana Vega,"Tu que dejaste pasar lo que dijimos 
Tu que pudiste olvidar lo prometido 
Como agua que paso bajo el puente 
Agua de rio, agua que se fue de repente 
Sin hacer ruido 
Y desde que te vi entre tanta gente 
Supe que no serias para siempre 
No se porque me quejo francamente 

Como agua te has ido 
Y me echaste al olvido 
Como agua en día de lluvia 
Me borras del camino
Como agua muy salada 
Me quemas las heridas 
Como agua que trae olas y lleva vidas 
Como agua de mar que ahoga gente 
No fuiste diferente 

Tu que caminas por ahí 
Planeando escapes 
Tu que te ríes de mi 
Me enamoraste 
Como agua que cae entre tus dedos 
Sin mucho esfuerzo 
Agua que no veras caer nunca 
En los desiertos
Y desde que te vi entre tanta gente 
Supe que no serias para siempre 
No se porque me quejo francamente

Mariana Vega,"Quiero una cuenta regresiva

Y quiero esta misma alma, para no olvidar lo aprendido 
Yo quiero vivir mil veces y las mil veces contigo

Prometo no llorare no es adiós ni muchas gracias 
Es un te encontrare 
Y se bien que algunas vidas 
Serán mas duras que otras 
Quizá nos tomes mas tiempo 
Pero eso al final no importa

Porque me llevo mi alma para no olvidar lo aprendido 
Y es que viviré mil veces y las mil veces contigo

Y tendremos otros ojos, pero las mismas miradas

Yo voy cerrando mis ojos 
Tú te guías con el viento
Y si tú corres conmigo, ya no necesito ver 

Y no vivo mintiendo, digo la verdad 
Solo calló cosas que no puedo explicar 
Si hacerlo me confunde más

Y ya no existe una puerta 
Por la que no pueda entrar

No hace falta que expliques cual es la razón

Como la ultima ves que les dirás adiós 
Te vi mirar las fotos, aquellas de los dos 
Con algo de nostalgia y algo de rencor 
Te vi cerrar la puerta, que en verdad no cerro 
Porque dejaste la llave frete al televisor 

Pero no se, que decir ni que hacer 
Solo tengo claro que: 
Si pierdo la calma y pierdo el control 
Ya no me queda nada, no me queda nada no 
Si pierdo la esperanza y pierdo la razón 
Ya no me queda nada, no me queda nada no 

Te vi cruzar la calle desde mi habitación 
Creí te detendrías a pensarlo mejor 
Te vi cerrar los ojos en plena intercepción 
Pensé que conseguirías una salida mejor 
Te vi cambiar el ritmo y vi tu indecisión 
Pero al final decidiste no cambiar de opinión 
Y yo me vi sentada en desesperación 
No me ha quedado nada, nada no

Palabras que ya me he callado para 
No hacer daño

Palabras que matan al alma sin así quererlo
Palabras que como disparos han 
Abierto un hueco que se ve desde el cielo
Palabras que con sólo hablarlas 
Me han quitado el sueño

Palabras que llenan de dicha 
Son tan livianas como lo es el viento
Son tus palabras más duras 
Las que quedan dentro
Son tus palabras más duras 
Las que yo recuerdo

Palabras que de mí se han ido
¿Dónde las encuentro? 
Palabras que no valen nada 
Porque no las siento
Palabras que construyen sueños 
Para destruirlos al final del cuento
Palabras que solo son ruidos 
Cómo las lamento

Palabras que son peligrosas
Deberlas decirlas con mucho cuidado
Porque seré siempre yo 
La que estará a tu lado

Son tan livianas como el viento

Dim alleyways where the shadows meet.

The chapel where we went to wed.

Where the sun never shines
And I shivered the whole night long.

And those shoes that you wear so fine ?
I got my dress from a railroad man
And my shoes from a driver deep in the mine.

Where the sun never shines

Before it is washed to the sea?

Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head,
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

How many times can a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?

Has danced these mercy bands since time begun
But oh, how weary and how long the day will he say

Living down sonora way.
He didn't look much like a lover
Yet I say his love words over
Often when I'm all alone,

Moonlight on the patio,
Old señora nodding near.
Me and juan were talking low
So the madre couldn't hear.
How those hours would go a-flying
And too soon I'd hear him sighing,
Softly murmuring sweet and low,
""mi amor, mi corazon.""

Haven't seen him since that night,
He can't cross the line you know.
Wanted for a gambling fight,
Well, perhaps it's better so.
Yet I sometimes sort of miss him
Since that last sad night I kissed him

Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights

And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,
And destiny's folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.

But now as the gardens of softening night time
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,
You and I come together
And walk through the dreams of the stars.

Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,

Rain to the sound of harpsichords, to the spell of fairy tale.
The heath was hung in magic mist, enchanted dripping glades,
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades
In the night time.

Crystals sparkles in the grass, I polish them with thought.
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught.
Fortunes told in grains of sand, here I am is all I know.
Candy stuck in children's hair, everywhere I go

That old song about the wild, wild side of life.
As I listen to the words you are saying,
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife.

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you say in the words of your song.
Too many times married men think they're still single
And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.

It's a shame that all the blame is on us women,
It's not true that only you, men, feel the same.
From the start most every heart that's been broken
Was because there always was a man to blame.

It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels

And that's caused many a good girl to go wrong.

Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Marianne Faithfull,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to
Be so quiet ?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeeze
I can't find my knees""
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care
For him
Sayin', ""Name me someone who's not a parasite and I'll go out and
Say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""Ya can't look at much, can ya man ?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still hasn't showed
We see the empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps on the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish trucks that load
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
",Visions of Johanna
Marianne Faithfull,"I'll send away all my false pride
And I'll forsake all of my life
Yes I'll be as true as true can be
If you'll come and stay with me.

Lovers of the past I'll leave behind
There'll never be another on my mind
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free
If you come and stay with me

The promises I made most faithfully 
I'll keep them still should you decide to leave
I'll try and see that you have all you need
If you'll come and stay with me

We'll live a life no one has ever known
But I know you're thinking that I'm hardly grown
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free
If you'll come and stay with me.

But oh thank God at last and finally
I could see you're gonna stay with me
",Come and Stay With Me
Marianne Faithfull,"Now is the glimmering spinning beginning
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows
Of night, here with you in my arms.

This is the moment that pauses to hold us
As you and I move in a background of wonder,
Surrounded by countless enclosures
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy.

Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower
And waited, and called out my name by the hour,
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings
To carry the sound, I have counted on pleading,
You see how I need you, come down.

And now between twilight and midnight I come to you,
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight,
Bright is the evening, the breezes have fenced us
And nestled against us 

You're here 
And warm.

And mine till the time
When the dawn will awake you,
The morning will shake you,
The highway will take you.

But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights
We count on the night to hold everything even,
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving,
And destinies folded and then in the dawn you'll be gone.

But now as the gardens of softening night time
Are blossoming slowly around where we are,
You and I come together
And walk through the dreams of the stars.

So here while the song of the deepening evening
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes,
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow
And know where we've been.",Counting
Marianne Faithfull,"Go away from my world,
Let me dream alone.
And you see it never worked from the start,
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart.

Go away from my world,
And let me dream alone.
I'll dry my eyes and comb my hair,
And I'll pretend you're never there.

Now you're gone the breezes blow so sadly
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly.

Go away from my world,
And let me walk all alone.
All alone in my room,
All alone and so sad.

Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be.

Where we can hear music play.
They keep the lights turned down low
It's a place where lovers go.
There you'll hold me tight and say

At the end of the day
We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand

Involved in an eating scene

Smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess
Listening to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic.

In dull house rooms with coloured lights swinging
Strange music boxes sadly tinkling
Drink in the sun shining all around you.

You gaze at his splendour with eyes you've not used yet.

And my eyes on the tv.

In a car taking a back seat
Staring out the window
Thinking about danger.
Playing in a wrong world

Marianne Faithfull,"Will you take me across the channel,
London Bridge is falling down
Strange a woman tries to save
What a man will try to drown

And he's the rain that they predicted,
It's the forecast every time
The rose has died because you picked it
I believe that brandy's mine

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

The world is getting flatter,
The sky is falling all around
And nothing is the matter
For I never cry in town

And a love like ours, my dear,
Is best measured when it's down
And I never buy umbrellas,
For there's always one around

And all over the world
Strangers
Talk only about the weather
All over the world
It's the same
It's the same
It's the same

And you know that it's beginning,
And you know that is the end
When once again we are strangers
And the fog comes rolling in

And all over the world

Talk only about the weather
All over the world

Marianne Faithfull,"Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
The sun will shine
In my back door some day

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living
Sometimes I feel like dying

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
Let the 2:19 train
Ease my trouble in mind

Trouble, oh trouble
Trouble's on your worried mind
When you see me laughing, baby
I'm laughing just to keep from crying

I'm going down to the river
I'm gonna take my old rocking chair
And if those blues overtake me
I'm gonna rock on away from there

My poor heart is beating slow
Never had no trouble
In my life before

Marianne Faithfull,"When I stole a twig from our little nest
And gave it to a bird with nothing in her beak
I had my balls and my brains put into a vise
And twisted around for a whole fucking week

Get a hold of your cock, get stoned on my hash?

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you let her suck your cock?
Oh, do me a favor, don't put me in the dark
Why'd ya do it, she said, they're mine, all your jewels
You just tied me to the mast of the ship of fools

Why'd ya do it, she said, when you know it makes me sore
'Cause she had cobwebs up her fanny and I believe in giving to the poor
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you spit on my snatch?
Are we out of love now, is this just a bad patch?

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd you do what you did?
You drove my ego to a really bad skid

Why'd you do it, she said, ain't nothing to laugh
You just tore all our kisses right in half

Every time I see your dick I see her cunt in my bed

Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did?
Why'd ya do it, she said, why'd ya do what you did?
Betray my little oyster for such a low bitch

Marianne Faithfull,"As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be

They hurt you at home and they hit you at school,
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
And then they expect you to pick a career,
But you really can't function, you're so full of fear, fear
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV, TV
And you think you're so clever and classless and free,
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still,
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to live like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be

A working class hero is something to be,
A working class hero is something to be",Working Class Hero

The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
And gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find here, you borrow
You cannot keep it long, it seems
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along

In this crummy southern town in this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No, you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you wonder who could that have been?
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""What's she got to grin?"" I'll tell you

There's a ship, The Black Freighter
With a skull on its masthead will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""Hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you? Earn your keep here!?
You toss me your tips and look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads as I'm making the beds
'cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight
Nobody is going to sleep here honey

And you say, ""Who's that kicking up a row?""
And you see me kinda starin' out the window
And you say, ""What's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell you

There's a ship, The Black Freighter turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now, you gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
'Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""Why do they spare that one?""
Yes, that's what you say, ""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship, The Black Freighter runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock is a swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They're movin' in the shadows where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people and they're bringin' 'em to me
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me, ""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock and so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death, I'll say, ""Right now, right now!""
Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say, ""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship, The Black Freighter disappears out to sea
And on it is me

You had some kind of job on the railway
And had nothing to do with the sea.

Till we went on our way one fine night.
And before two more weeks were over,
You thought nothing I did was right.
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab,
From the source of the river to the sea.
When I look at my face in the mirror,
There's an old woman staring back at me.

You didn't want love, Johnny,
You wanted cash, Johnny.
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,

And I still love you so.

I would never have thought of asking
How you'd got that peculiar name,
But from one end of the coast to the other
You were known everywhere we came.

Happily all hands unite,
And with money in your pocket
You can clean up, price is right.
There are some who dwell in darkness,
There are others bathed in light.

Those in darkness pass from sight.

Marianne Faithfull,"You've seen him
In the undirected light of street dreams
Doing nothing
Standing, like to seem casual
With a resemblance to people held by fear
Lit by fire and disrepair
The blue millionaire

Don't listen and keep asking
Only stories reach this far
No one's left and no one's coming
And I will disappear far away from you
The American wind and the blue millionaire

Blue millionaire
Blue millionaire

There is no such thing as the wrong man
Blue as the dusk that ended my day and shut off the light and air
I wish I could tell you
How he put them in cages
Found you where you slept
Got me down with something else than bruises
Tied me to a blue chair
Lit by fire and disrepair
The blue millionaire

Seen him drinking gin from pale blue bottles
Drowning in shadow
Shadows moving in
Forever imagine
Imagine it's him
Nearby the window
With dreams broken in

I don't laugh anymore or smile
I am lost in the body, the passion of time
He is screening my dreams and everything that's mine
Don't stay in this mirror other hands have left me in
You don't blow away as I do
It will be the same again
Turn and point away from here
Steal what you cannot win

Where you can read the sky and stars
Safe to walk upon the sea

Was the most fantastic place I've ever known.
For just a dollar you'd get all you wanted,
All you wanted, all you wanted
Of whatever kind of joy you called your own.
But if you had been around to see the sun
Well I don't know you might not like for you to see
The stools at the bar were damp with rye
On the dancefloor the grass grew high,
Through the roof the moon was shining green
And the music really gave you some return on what you paid
Hey Joe, play that old song they always played.

That ol' Bilbao
Down were we used to go
I can't remember the words 
It's so long ago.

I don't know if it would have brought you joy or grief but
It was fantastic
It was fantastic
It was fantastic
Beyhond belief.

Bill's be all in Bilbao, Bilbao, Bilbao,
Came a day the end of May in '98
Four guys from Bristol came with sacks of coal dust,
Sacks of coal dust, sacks of coal dust
And the time they showed us all was really great.
But if you had been around to see the sun
Well I don't know you might not like what you'd've seen.
The brandy bottles smashing through the air
And the chairs flying everywhere
Through the roof the moon's still shining green
And those fog eyes all went going crazy with their pistols blazing
High,
""Think you can stop 'em ? Well, go ahead and try!""

Down were we used to go

It was fantastic
Beyond belief.

Bill's be all in, Bilbao, Bilbao, Bilbao,
Now they've cleaned it up and made it middle class
With potted palms and aspree
Very bourgeois, very bourgeois
Just another place to put your ass,
But if you could come around to see the fun
Well, I don't know, you might not find it such a strain,
They've cleaned up all the pools of broken glass,
On parquet floors you can't grow grass,
They've shut the green moon out because of rain
And the music makes you cringe now when you think of what you paid
Hey Joe, play that ol' song they always played

That ol' Bilbao
Down where we used to go
That ol' Bilbao
Casting it's golden glow
That ol' Bilbao moon
Love never laid me low
That ol' Bilbao
Why does it hurt me so?

I don't know if it would have brought you joy or grief but
It was fantastic
It was fantastic
It was fantastic

Marianne Faithfull,"Our revels now our ended
These are actors, as I foretold you
We're all spirits, and are melted into air, into thin air

And like the baseless fabric of this vision
The cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces
The solemn temples, the great globe itself

Yeah, all which it inherit shall dissolve
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind

We are such stuff as dreams are made of
And our little life is rounded
With a sleep

Marianne Faithfull,"Anna I

So we saved up, bought ourselves an outfit,
Nighties, nylons, beautiful dresses.
Soon we found a job that was going,
A job as dancer in a cabaret,
A job in memphis, the second big town we came to.

Oh how hard it was for anna!
Beautiful clothes can make a good girl particular ¡º
When the drinking tigress meets herself in the pool,
She's apt to become a menace.

She began talking about art (of all things),
About the art (if you please) of cabaret.
In memphis, the second big town we came to,
It wasn't art that sort of people came for.
That sort of people came for something else;

And when a man has paid for his evening
He expects a good show in return.
So if you cover up your bosom and thighs like you had a rash,
Don't be surprised to see them yawning.

So I told my art-loving sister anna:
""leave your pride to those who can well afford it.
Do what you are asked to do and not what you want,
For that isn't what is wanted.""

Oh but I had trouble, I can tell you,
With her fancy pig-head notions.
Night by night I sat by her bedside,
Holding her hand and saying this:
""think of our little house in louisiana!""

O lord, look down upon our daughter,
Show her the way that leads the good to thy reward.
Who fights the good fight and all self subdues,
Wins the palm, gains the crown.
",Pride [Stolz]
Marianne Faithfull,"Midway, this way of life we're bound upon
I woke to find myself in a dark wood
Where the right road was wholly lost and gone

Aye me, how hard to speak of it
That rude and rough and stubborn forest
The mere breath of memory stirs the old fear in the blood

But when, at last, I stood beneath a steep hillside
Which closed that valley's wandering maze
Whose dread had pierced me to the heart root deep

Then I looked up and saw the morning rays
Mantle its shoulder from that planet bright
Which guides men's feet aright on all their ways

Marianne Faithfull,"After the ceasefire that they swore would last
She had the bright idea: ""To hell with the past!""

She thought she really meant it, that's the honest truth
She felt it in her marrow, she felt it in her boots
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

The man she married, he was something else
He adored the chaos, smashing all the delft

It's time to lead a quiet life for the love of Jesus
Let's sit down together, and engage in talks of peace
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

He was Irish Catholic, she had English blood
They met in a good restaurant, they gave the secret nod
She ordered fish and lentils, he the kidney stew
She played with bold impulses, wine turned his lips blue
They left in separate taxis to the same address
In case someone was watching, and there they did confess
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

It was all the others' fault, they thought at any rate
After the ceasefire to put an end to hate
She was reaching for her knife, he a fork and spoon
They sat about devouring the poison of the moon
Shared a fatal cigarette neither one would light
Their breath was flame enough, nobody said goodnight
After the ceasefire, after the ceasefire

After the ceasefire that they swore would last
They had the strange idea of living in the past
That's where love lies bleeding, licking at its wounds

Your face filled with lies
Hovers all around me in this room

Clouds hung with my dismay
A hot bed where we lay
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb

If time becomes a judge
If my body holds a grudge
It's just because I needed sanctuary

Your skin under my nails
My curiosity that failed
To save myself for something that I need

I don't wanna bleed
Or bruise up black and blue
Do I deserve these things
All for wanting you?

Like some virgin with her cloth
I play the goddess coming through
Now I play the parting slave
All for wanting you

We do things 'cause we must
The law of love and lust
Comes together just like oil on flame

I looked into your eyes
You saw me naked for a while
How d'you like it in my little nest?

Who was really using who?
In here the scent of you
Stains the sheets with memory and lust

When I get back on the street
Tell everybody that I meet
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust

I don't wanna bleed
Or bruise up black and blue
Do I deserve these things

What's it all for if you can't touch the power,

Don't steal what I have got, baby,
'Cause it's hardly enough for myself.
Don't steal what I've got, baby,

Take us out on a ride.

The world stands still with you in the room.
I cross the floor and I'm high and I'm rich

Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I can hear him coughing all night long
About a hundred floors above me

I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They just tied me to this table right here

Not in the Tower of Song.

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never , we'll never have to lose it again.

Well I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone

Dearest, the shadows I live with are numberless

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy is Sunday--with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart here

Marianne Faithfull,"The family tree was chainsawed Wednesday week
So now I have to mingle with the meek
Hey mister, you have finally met your match
Now everybody wants to kiss my snatch

To go where God knows who has gone before
I am a muse, not a mistress, not a whore
Oh, suburban shits who want some class
All queue up to kiss my ass

And I was only trying to please
I never got any royalties oh no, not me
I'm still sliding through life on charm
Sliding through life on charm

If Marianne was born a man she'd show you all
A way to piss your life against the wall
Go ahead why don't you leave me to these thugs
And creeps who want to fuck a nun on drugs?

Is it such a sin I never ever tried too hard?
I had to know how far was going too far
In proper homes throughout the land, Fathers try to understand
Why Eunice who is seventeen aspires to live her life like me

Oh no, can't ya see, Daddy?
She's just captivated by my charm
Sliding through life on charm

Sliding
Sliding
Never

I wonder why the schools don't teach anything useful nowadays
Like how to fall from grace and slide with elegance from a pedestal
I never asked to be on in the first place

Turn into stone

Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now I think
I've got a lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And every day can be

The past, well now let me tell you about the past

Was I ever in love? I called it love
I mean, it felt like love,
There were moments when
Well, there were moments when.

Go out with you? Why not?
Do I like to dance? Of Course.
Take a walk along the beach tonight?
I'd love to,
But don't try to touch me, don't try to touch me
Cos that will never happen again.
Shall we dance?

(The future)
Tomorrow? Well, tomorrow's a long way off.
Maybe someday I'll have somebody's hand,
Maybe somewhere someone will understand.
You know I used to sing
'A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket.
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way
And I'm gonna fall in love.'
But at the moment it doesn't look good.
At the moment it will never happen again.

I don't think it will ever happen again.","Past, Present and Future"

Fly fast through the airwaves, meet with pride and truth.

Marié Digby,"Its 3 am as I stumble over to my bed
Got a funny premonition that tomorrow's gonna be the same
But all I remember
Is how we think I heard you call my name
And your open invitation to come over for a drink or two

But when you do well
The true intentions of your secret smile
I couldn't stop
I couldn't tell you no
I hate to say I'm giving in to you

[Chorus]
I wake up next to you
Oh we're through with it
I fell in love with a fool
And I know I'm not the only one
You lead your trap beneath the obvious
Until some good girl pulls through
It's true, I'm not the only one
To fall in love with a fool
I fell in love with a fool

At the end of the hall
In room number 804
There was the devil himself and his dark kept secret hell
And curiosity grew with every single following day
And I was dreaming, dreaming that you're here with me
I hate to say I'm giving in to you

[Chorus]

I tell the truth you find it fun to play another
But can't you see that I am only falling further
And tell me why you even took the time to bother
I always knew that you would only bring me trouble
And the way I move I think that I am seeing double
I know you know you will only cause me sorrow

I fell in love with a fool",Fool
Marié Digby,"You wear your hair
Like it's your best accessory

Ever have to compete with that

But...

I can't belong

I can't belong

So much figuring out to do..

I don't wanna be a girlfriend
I don't want to talk about my feelings... Ya
I don't wanna be some girlfriend...
I don't want to have to explain what I'm thinking

I go alone
To watch stupid romance movies
And I sit, wishing,
It was your arms wrapped around me
And I just deny
That all I want is a piece of you
But I guess it's true, don't wanna talk on the phone,
Don't want attachments, don't wanna be your girlfriend...

I don't want to be that kind of girl

Marié Digby,"There's a girl
Who sits under the bleachers
Just another day eating alone
And though she smiles
There is something she's hiding
And she cant find a way to relate
But she just goes unnoticed
As the crowd passes by
And she'll pretend to be busy
When inside she just wants to cry
And she'll sing

Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little harder, I really really want you
To put yourself in her shoes
Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little closer and maybe
Then you will see why she waits for the day
When you'll ask her her name

The beginning, in the first weeks of class
She did everything to try and fit in
But the others they couldn't seem to get past
All the things that mismatched on the surface
And she would close her eyes when they laughed
As she fell down the stairs
And the more that they joked
And the more that they screamed
She retreated to where she is now
And she'll sing

Take a little look at the life of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little harder, I really really want you
To put yourself in her shoes
Take another look at the face of Miss Always Invisible
Look a little closer and maybe
Then you will see why she waits for the day
When you'll ask her her name

Then one day just the same as the last
Just the days been in counting the time
Came a boy that sat under the bleachers
Just a little bit further behind",Miss Invisible
Marié Digby,"The thing about love is I never saw it comin'

Is you know just how to get me

The thing about me is that I really wanna let you (wanna let you)
Open that door (open that door)

On my face
And I can't see a thing

An empty stage
With nothing but this girl
Who's singing this simple melody
And wearing her heart on her sleeve
And right now

[Chorus]
I have you
For a moment I can tell I've got you
Cause your lips don't move
And something is happening
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
I've put a spell over you

Beauty emanates from every word that you say
And capture the deepest thoughts
In the purest and simplest of ways
But you see
I'm not that graceful like you
Nor am I as eloquent
But just a simple melody
Can change the way that you see me

I would damn near beg for you
Put aside, all my pride
So don't keep me hanging here
Cause this girl is falling stupid for you
Oh, oh stupid for you[x2]

The proper thing to do
Is for me to act like a lady and wait
For you to make the first move

But I don't think you're getting the point
That it's you, that I want
I don't care if I act a fool
I would damn near beg for you
Put aside, all my pride
So don't keep me hanging here

That I find myself wandering down your street
And I can't seem to give it up
I've even stopped making these excuses
For why you're stuck here in my thoughts
When it's been long enough

[Bridge]
And I try to keep myself moving
But I'm not getting anywhere

[Chorus]
I wait in the same spot
Brain like a parking lot
You're the traffic in my head
You're the reason that I'm wrecked
I pray for it to stop
Like rain on the sidewalk
The traffic in my head, you're the traffic in my head

There's just too much to forget

Guess I should be happy now
Everything is back to how it was
Before you came around
I'm already changing
And I've even tried
To find a new distraction
But still you surround
As if it's not hard enough

A part of me thinks that I'm going crazy
The world's spinning, my vision is hazy
And none of this makes any sense

Is a lot like water
Trickling down a page
Of the most beautiful colors
I can't quite put my finger
Down on the moment
That I became like this...

You see I am the bravest girl
You will ever come to meet
Yet I shrink down to nothing
At the thought of someone
Really seeing me
I think my heart is wrapped around
And tangled up in winding weeds

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna go on living
Being so afraid of showing
Someone else my imperfections
And even though my feet
Are trembling
And every word I say
Comes stumbling
I will bare it all... Watch me unfold
Unfold

These hands that I hold
Behind my back are
Bound and broken
By my own doing
And I can't feel
Anything anymore
I need a touch to remind me
I'm still real

Unfold, unfold
Unfold, unfold

It's dying to be free
You see... I can't live the rest of my life
So guarded

Marié Digby,"Last night I fell in love with a stranger
Behind the glass house he came walking out the back-door
Into a crowd of screaming girls calling his name

I never saw it coming, the way a voice can make me feel
And I fear that I am falling
I should be old enough to know
Not to fall in love with the voice on the radio

[Chorus]
So here I stand fighting what I feel for you
Torn between what reason says and how I really feel
And here I stand, wondering what to say to you
Hoping that you feel the same, the same as I do

He's in a rock band with a voice like an angel
And eyes of a raven sky
And suddenly I find myself twelve years old again
Dreaming of you

But who am I kidding to even think that you might see me
It's in the stars that girls like me
And boys like you were never meant to be

[Chorus]

Would you be scared if I told you I like you
And would you run if I told you I love you

[Chorus] 

As I do, as I do

And I fear that I am falling

And the temperature's changed, nothing's the same
Left me, in yesterday,
You don't see me that way, touch me that way, no more

You got me standing at the bottom of this mountain that we've made
(mountain that we've made)
And the ground is shaking from all of our mistakes
(all of our mistakes)
But there's no wall nothing but us is in our way

Why do we stay?
Watching us fadin'
Trapped in by regret
There's no way out, and there's no way in, no

Marie Espinosa,"""On apprend l´eau par la soif
Et la passion par les affres""
Elle a appris l´amour par lui
Et ne s´en est jamais remis
Et je l´ai vu courber le dos
Je l´ai vu pleurer des ruisseaux
Il lui a chanté ritournelle
Elle s´est sentie pousser des ailes
Mais il n´a pas eu l´étincelle
Et depuis, pour oublier
Elle couche des mots sur le papier

Il lui reste son piano
Pour l´aider à porter son fardeau
Elle pleurera des larmes en vers
Un jour viendra, passera l´hiver
Son chagrin, elle en fait des chansons
En espérant qu´elles l´atteindront
Comme des bouteilles à la mer
En espérant, un jour, lui plaire

En attendant, elle auditionne
Avec d´autres, elle papillonne
Mais elle regarde son téléphone
En espérant qu´il la sonne
Y en a qui disent qu´elle est conne
Ceux-là n´ont jamais aimé personne
Elle accepte à demi-mot
De n´être qu´un simple numéro
Elle aurait tant voulu compter
Et pour ne pas désespérer
Elle couche des mots sur le papier

Un amour tenace n´est pas perdu
Un soir, le voilà revenu
Elle lui chante sa ritournelle
Tant pis si elle se brûle les ailes
Elle fait visiter ses dentelles
Et le beau se fait la belle
Combien de coups de couteaux
Pour arrêter un cœur si gros?
Elle aurait tant voulu l´aimer
Et à défaut de l´embrasser
Elle couche des mots sur le papier

Il lui reste son piano
Pour l´aider à porter son fardeau
Elle pleurera des larmes en vers
Comme des bouteilles à la mer
Un jour viendra, passera l´hiver
Mais toujours elle espère
Qu´il viendra à l´unisson
Poser un chœur sur sa chanson",Elle Couche...
Marie Espinosa,"Elle me dit comment vivre ma vie
D´ la tête aux pieds, du corps jusqu´à l´esprit
Elle me dit c´ qu´est in, c´ qu´est out
Le dernier cri, le dernier sac
Elle me donne le ""la"" de la chanson
Elle voudrait faire l´opinion
À coups de pub, à coups de marques
De crèmes entubes, de masques arnaques
Elle me fout la tête en vrac! {x2}

J´aimerais pouvoir être hors standard
Ne pas m´ laisser influencer
Par ces beautés photoshopées
J´aimerais pouvoir être hors standard {x2}

Elle me fout une de ces pressions
Avec ses régimes à la con
Ses incontournables de la saison
Mais elle oublie que j´ n´ai pas un rond
Elle me dit comment gérer mes ex
Tout sur les joujoux en latex
Sur mes fantasmes avec trois mecs
Depuis qu´ je la lis, j´ fais peur aux hommes
Et je ne suis plus avec personne
Son dossier sexe, il est énorme
Le dossier sexe, vraiment énorme

J´aimerais pouvoir être hors standard
Ne pas m´ laisser influencer
Par tous ces rêves bien formatés
J´aimerais pouvoir être hors standard {x2}

Elle, c´est un peu comme la bible
De l´accessoire inaccessible
Du dérisoire et du risible
De l´idéale façon l´Oréal
Elle, c´est sûr, me pourrit la vie
Pourtant j´ la lis tous les lundis
Je la déteste pire que ma meilleure amie {x2}

Il a fallu bien le cacher

Que de finir sur mes reins

M´a tout refait : les fesses, le nez
À quoi ça sert d´être naturelle?
Moi, tout ce que j´ veux c´est être belle

Dans les champs de cocaïne
Devraient être plutôt contents
Quand je m´en fous plein les narines

Dans la vie certains n´ont pas le sou
C´est bête à dire, mais je m´en fous!

Je mets mes feux de détresse
Pour sortir de mon âge
Je ne veux pas qu´on me laisse
Sur une voie de garage
La vie passe en vitesse
Et t´encaisse pour finir à la casse
À la casse

Embourbée dans ce guêpier
Au carrefour de la chance
Je lance les dés, je fonce après, je pense
Je me défonce, je me démène
Sans savoir où ça me mène
Sans savoir où je m´enfonce
Je suis toujours à la traîne
À la traîne

{Refrain:}
C´est l´âge des possibles
J´en gravirai des cimes
Cœur vaillant, invincible
Et même si je m´abîme
Si j´y laisse des plumes
Je décrocherai la lune
La lune
Et je lutte et je chute
Je marche et j´en crève
Quand je manque le but
Je tombe, je me relève
Je n´ sais pas le comment du pourquoi
J´ai la vie devant moi
Devant moi

""La valeur n´attend pas
Le nombre des années""
Pourtant moi, j´attends là
Sans me faire remarquer
Devant moi, je ne vois
Que des portes fermées
Et mes rêves sans emplois
Ils me servent à quoi?
À quoi?

J´ai peur, mais j´avance
Tant pis si rien n´est sûr
Qu´on me donne ma chance
Ou je vais dans le mur
Car la vie qui commence
C´est la vie à la dure
""Le temps de l´innocence""?
Non mais j´ vous jure!
Je vous jure!

{au Refrain}

Ignorance, impuissance
Espoir fou et détresse

Mother can't you see
That this fight is all about me
You think that I'm wild
But I'm a woman and still a child

Disappointed and proud
I wish I dared to scream out loud
We've been the same
God give me words so I can explain

Don't say I never tried
Don't ever say I lied
Will I still be something
When you're dead and gone

Please try to ease my pain
So I can feel again
Say you always loved me
Before you're dead and gone
All alone on my own

But finally you won't be no other
Than my mother

Marie Fredriksson,"A table in the sun is all I want
Just wanna slow down and rest my heart
So many tears and so much fear
So much happened last two years

No rain, no sorrow
The bad days are over
The sun is shining through
Even November days too

So much we learned
A whole new world
Thank God, I'm saved
I'm still cruising the seventh wave

It's hard to understand, what we've been through
I guess we need time me and you
Oh, so many times I wondered why
It happened to me this time

No rain, no sorrow
The bad days are over
The sun is shining through
Even November days too

So much we learned
A whole new world
Thank God, I'm saved
I'm still cruising the seventh wave

A table in the sun, and me and you

Hammer
HeartCrash

You never think your lover’s words could kill you
And you can’t for see the blow that is your last
But you’ve brought me to my knees with a blow that I believe
Has somehow paralyzed my need for fighting back

I can’t pretend that they don’t know your secret
And I can’t pretend that I don’t know it too
I can hear the people talking, I can feel their pity eyes

Dare I say the fault is really mine
Dare I say the fault is mine

I, I, I wish I could tell you
I, I, I love you still
I, I, I gave you the hammer
But I didn’t know that you would strike to kill

You’re quite as I stutter over questions
Whose answers I don’t really want to know

Did you whisper that you loved her, 
Drop your kisses on her neck
And with determination, down the wine
There will always be another and another choice to make

Another chance to justify the crime,
Another chance to choose the crime

I, I, I wish I could tell you
I, I, I love you still
I, I, I gave you the hammer
But I didn’t know that you would strike to kill

I, I, I wish I could tell you
I, I, I never will

When I didn’t know that you would strike to kill

I love the shape of your mouth
I love the taste of your lips
I love the way you pull me into you and I melt
When you’re holding my hips

I love the scar on your chest
And all your perfect tattoos
You’re a kind of drug, the kind that I need, 
The only kind I could choose

Oh we can’t get any better than this
You’ve stolen me with your perfect kiss,
And I know, I know, I know, you’re who I’ve waited for

I love the sound of your laugh
When you throw back your head
I love the way you always reach for my hand 
When I get out of bed

I love the way that you tease
Call me ball and chain
But you would sink to the depths of the seas
Still breathing my name

Oh we can’t get any better than this
You’ve stolen me with your perfect kiss,
And I know, I know, I know, you’re who I’ve waited for
You’ve captured me, but it’s no surprise
I saw it coming in your eyes
And I do, I do, I do, I belong to you

(Oh, Oh, Oh) 
(Oh, Oh, Oh)
Let’s build a home
Let’s build a home
Cause you are, you are, you are
You are home, you are home

Oh we can’t get any better than this
You’ve stolen me with your perfect kiss,
And I know, I know, I know, you’re who I’ve waited for

And I do, I do, I do, I belong to you

Far and wide, I see them searching
Day and night, spend their lives looking for

Aimed for the dark, looking for the truth
But for me, all I know is 

It’s always been you, love

I’ll be yours until the sun dies
Til the stars fall from the blue sky

Steady as we rise

Sometimes when the fight
Burns through the night
Leaving you tired

I’ll wait for you here
To hold you my dear
And keep you my dear

Out of the sky

A gift of time and years of laughter

Perfect in my imperfection

Don't save me,

Nothing to hide when a heart is open, oh
I am more than my reflection

Standing before our own eyes

And butterflies don't paint their wings

Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time, oh

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place

I've grown tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time, oh

And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place, oh, oh

So I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face

Oh, my heart's been burning, my soul keeps yearning
Sometimes I can hardly wait for that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away to another time and another place
I'm gonna be swept away, oh

Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured

Marie Laforêt,"Autrefois, je ne savais pas 
Qu'il est des mots qu'on n'entend pas 
Mais un soir une ombre est venue 
Qui m'a dit: ""Écoute un peu plus 
Une voix te parle aux mots inconnus 
Entends-tu 
La voix du silence?"" 

Je m'en suis allé promener 
Les peupliers se sont penchés 
Pour me raconter des histoires 
Qu'ils étaient les seuls à savoir 
Et le vent et la mer 
Doucement me parlaient 
J'entendais 
La voix du silence 

Et depuis j'ai vu des gens 
Qui jetaient des mots à tous vents 
Et qui discouraient sans parler 


Qui entendaient sans écouter 
En proposant des chants connus 
Que nulle voix n'a jamais repris 
Et leurs cris 
Couvrent la voix du silence 

Les hommes ne voient plus les fleurs 
Ils en ont pris des rides au coeur 
Ils espèrent en faisant du bruit 
Meubler le vide de leur vie 
Et même au ton, sans un bruit 
En gouttes de rosée 
Étouffées 
Etouffées comme la voix du silence 

Toi tu dors à mon côté 
Et je n'ose pas parler 
De peur que mes mots se confondent 
Avec le bruit que fait le Monde 
Mais je t'aime tant 
Qu'un jour enfin tu comprendras 
Tu m'entendras

Mais l'espace d'une nuit
L'amour se met à la pluie
Je t'aimerai jusqu'à la fin des temps
Je t'aimerai jusqu'au prochain printemps
Je t'aimerai aussi longtemps
Que je pourrai t'aimer
Tu m'aimeras, tu m'aimeras toujours
Tu m'aimeras jusqu'au prochain amour
Tu m'aimeras autant de jours
Que tu pourras m'aimer

L'amour, c'est comm' le beau temps
Ca change, change bien souvent
Peu importe si demain
L'amour se met au chagrin
On s'aimera jusqu'à la fin des temps
On s'aimera jusqu'au prochain printemps
On s'aimera aussi longtemps
Que l'on pourra s'aimer
On s'aimera, on s'aimera toujours
On s'aimera jusqu'au prochain amour
On s'aimera autant de jours
Que l'on pourra s'aimer

L'amour change si souvent
Ne perdons pas un seul instant
On ne peut jamais savoir
L'amour qu'il fera ce soir",L' Amour Qu'il Fera Demain

Marie Lindberg,"Thought it was easier than it was
To forget you and run away
To someone else's arms
Got lost somewhere about half the way
On the way down inside my mind to find you

But there's too little time, too many feeling
Inside my head they wanna get out
They wanna get home
Well, if you go this time

Figured I'd see you but you're not here
It reminds me of the times with you lying in my arms
I hear your voice but I don't know where
You are hiding or if you're near, I sense you

But there's too little time too many feeling
Inside my head they wanna get out
They wanna get home
Well, if you go this time

Thought I was clever but now I know
That I was not to let you go
To someone else's arms
I guess I'm sorry but how about you
Are you happy or can you feel it too? I miss you

And I replied, “I don't think so at all“
And then we wouldn't be here
A reuniting cup of coffee, trying to recall

I know God, what have we done to each other?
And tell me dear, where did we go wrong?
And did we grow apart or did we just not grow together?
Living our dreams

When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore

And it's time tell me, what you are thinking and guide me
Where do we go from here?
Do our ways converge or do they separate to nowhere?
Destination unknown

When you're sleeping on the couch
When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be
You and me, anymore

When love becomes sacrificing
Then I'm not sure it's gonna be

Is how I feel when you're with me
Connected than rejected
And how can this be?

Why can't we kiss and make up?
Does it have to, does it have to stop?
Must we fight and break up

Then I would not have found you

For love's the greatest healer to be found

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

So he'll hold my hand
As they light up the sky
And marry me on an April night

Is whatever I want

Songs about you and me.
Been singing to every soul in Tennessee.
Nobody seems to listen,
No one ever smiles the way that you do.
So I guess you never hear me on the radio,
And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine to hold you once more.

Won't you meet me in Montana.
I want to see the mountains in your eyes.
Woah, woah, I had all of this life I can handle.
Meet me underneath that big Montana sky.

I left home for Hollywood.
Lookin' for a part to play.
Well you always said I had such a pretty face.
But, I guess I'm not that pretty,
'Cause no one looks at me the way you do.
Well you'll always be a movie star to me.
Darlin' now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream.

Won't you meet me in Montana
I want to see the mountains your eyes.
Woah, Woah I had all of this life I can handle
Meet me underneath that big Montana sky.

Well were stuck here in these hills that they call mountains.
Darlin' back home in your arms is right where I want to be.
Won't you meet me in Montana
I want to see the mountains your eyes.
Woah, Woah I had all of this life I can handle
Meet me underneath that big Montana sky.

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

When things settled down.
And send me money
For a ticket when things got better.

Like a river it just keeps on rollin'
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

When you really found it
There's no doubt about it

There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart
Like a river it just keeps on rollin'
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

Whoa, like a river it just keeps on rollin'
Till it fills you up to overflow and
There's no stopping, no stopping
No stopping your heart

Come, go away with me
We'll take the highway
I'll see you in between

I listen to my head
And every word have come
It's been two days without it
The sleeping in the sun, hey

Crossing through Tennessee
Watching the sunrise
Thinking about a dream
Well, we'll listen all night

To the footsteps in the hall
There's thunder and there's lightening
A hundred miles off

I got my hands full
All summer long
I got my hands full
I got my hands full

Come, go away with me
Drinking our coffee
Under the canopy

Never saw a morning
I slept through half a day
There's thunder and there's lightening

Marie Paule Belle,"Lorsque je suis arrivée dans la capitale
J'aurais voulu devenir une femme fatale
Mais je ne buvais pas, je ne me droguais pas
Et je n'avais aucun complexe
Je suis beaucoup trop normale, ça me vexe

Je ne suis pas parisienne
Ça me gêne, ça me gêne
Je ne suis pas dans le vent
C'est navrant, c'est navrant
Aucune bizarrerie
Ça m'ennuie, ça m'ennuie
Pas la moindre affectation
Je ne suis pas dans le ton
Je n'suis pas végétarienne
Ça me gêne, ça me gêne
J'n'suis pas Karatéka
Ça me met dans l'embarras
Je ne suis pas cinéphile
C'est débile, c’est débile
Je ne suis pas M.L.F.
Je sens qu'on m'en fait grief
M'en fait grief, m’en fait grief

Bientôt j'ai fait connaissance d'un groupe d'amis
Vivant en communauté dans le même lit
Comm' je ne buvais pas, je ne me droguais pas
Et n'avais aucun complexe,
Je crois qu'ils en sont restés tout perplexes

Je ne suis pas nymphomane
On me blâme, on me blâme
Je ne suis pas travesti
Ça me nuit, ça me nuit
Je ne suis pas masochiste
Ça existe, ça existe
Pour réussir mon destin
Je vais voir le médecin
Je ne suis pas schizophrène
Ça me gêne, ça me gène
Je ne suis pas hystérique
Ça s'complique, ça s’complique
Je lui dis je désespère
Je n'ai pas de goûts pervers
De goûts pervers, de goûts pervers 

Mais si, me dit le docteur en se rhabillant
Après ce premier essai c'est encourageant
Si vous ne buvez pas, vous ne vous droguez pas
Et n'avez aucun complexe
Vous avez une obsession : c'est le sexe

Depuis je suis à la mode
Je me rôde, je me rôde
Dans les lits de Saint-Germain
C'est divin, c’est divin
Je fais partie de l'élite
Ça va vite, ça va vite
Et je me donne avec joie
Tout en faisant du yoga
Je vois les films d'épouvante
Je m’en vante, je m’en vante
En serrant très fort la main
Du voisin, du voisin
Me sachant originale
Je cavale, je cavale
J'assume ma libido
Je vais draguer en vélo
Maint'nant je suis parisienne
J'me surmène, j’me surmène
Et je connais la détresse
Et le cafard et le stress
Enfin à l'écologie
J'm'initie, j’m’initie
Et loin de la pollution, et loin de la pollution, et loin de la pollution

Qui cachait ses chagrins dans les jardins perdus
Et qui aimait la pluie et le vent et la paille
Et le frais de la nuit et les jeux défendus

Quand viendra ce jour-là, sans passé, sans bagages
Nous partirons ensemble vers un nouveau printemps
Qui mêlera nos corps, nos mains et nos visages
Il y a tant et tant de temps que l'on s'attend
À quoi bon se redire les rêves de l'enfance
À quoi bon se redire les illusions perdues?
Quand viendra ce jour-là, nous partirons ensemble
À jamais retrouvés, à jamais reconnus

This is harder than it has to be, did we even try
And everytime you look at me
Your eyes can see right through mine
I'm lookin' at a memory, as it all goes by

Never again will I lie, oh baby
So don't ask me why

Just kiss me goodbye

Baby you know we tried
No more tears to be cried
So just kiss me, just kiss me goodbye

And I don't know why
I need a little time to break
So I won't let life pass me by
Say everything we have to say
There's no holding back
You'll always have a part of me
And I hope you can live with that

Wings with no direction
Tossed over waves of emptiness
Looking glass with no reflection
But at the end of my rope
You came and gave me hope

When I needed faith, you were an answered prayer
When I needed life, you were a breath of air
When my soul was a desert, you were a fountain
When I needed a rock, you were a mountain

Why at the bottom in the dark
Would someone reach down and touch me
Light drove the shadows from my heart
What a way to say you love me
This time I won't lose my way
Holding your hand everyday

Don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony
My mind is clear
I may be low or miles high off in the distance
I want you near


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere


And if they take me flying on the magic carpet
See me wave
If our communication fails I'll reconnect it
I want to rave


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere


No matter where the road is leading us remember
Don't be afraid
We have a continent that sometimes comes between us
That's okay


I love you, even when I'm sleeping
When I close my eyes
You're everywhere

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

De que mis ojos nunca enfocaban

Se que no he dado suficiente
Que no he amado con la fuerza
Que se debe, como uno debe
Se debe

Que me fichen de los locos el peor

Sera que este mundo habrá perdido una razón

Pienso viajar sin equipaje
Sin mucho rodeo
Sin buscarle sentido
Apostando todo en cada instante
Sin mirar atrás, borrando memoria

Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams

Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the St. Tropez mirage

Champagne corks are firing at the sun again
Swooping swallows chased by violins again

Straafed by Strauss they sulk in crumbling eaves again

Couples loiter in the cloisters, social leeches quoting Chaucer

So welcome, it's a party 

Angie chalks another blue, mother smiles she did it too
Chitters chat and gossips lash
Posers pose pressmen flash, flash, flash
Smiles polluted with false charm, locking onto Royal arms,
Society columns now ensured, return to mingle with the crowds

Beagling on the downs, oh please so come they say

Marillion,"Midnight suns bid moors farewell, retreats from charging dusk
Mountains echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks
They place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviors born of dreams
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly heads they bow in shame
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes
Their eyes, their eyes, their eyes

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood, as moonbeams haunt the sky

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shapers songs no longer heal the fear
Within their hearts, within their hearts
Within their hearts, within their eyes

Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through
Mother nature's bastard child, shunned by leaf and stream
An alien in an alien land, seeks solace within dreams

The shapers lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp
Beguiling queen, her innocence offends his icy heart

Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell
Sulfurous essence pervades 'round the grassy dell
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries

Screams are his music, lightning his guide
Raping the darkness, death by his side

Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know

Heroes delusions with feet in the grave
Lurker at the threshold
He cares not for the brave
He cares not for the brave

So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out
You should have known better after all this time
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes

Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame?
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm goin' to take no blame

So you say you believe in all of mother nature's laws
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives
Ooh, when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods

Then you try to place the killers blade in my hand
You call for justice and distort the truth
Well, I've had enough of all your pretty, pretty speeches
Receive your punishment, expose your throats to my righteous claws
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, and let the blood flow
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow

Let the blood flow, let the blood flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow
Let the blood flow, let the blood flow, flow, flow

Let the blood, let the blood, let the blood
Let the blood, let the blood, let the blood
Let the blood, let the blood, let the blood

Intelocked through a missing piece.
We are Renaissance children becalmed beneath the bridge of sighs,
Forever throwing firebrands at the stonework.

We are Siamese children related by the heart,
Bleeding from the surgery of initial confrontation,
Holding the word scalpels on trembling lips.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.
This is the ricochet...

Drowning Tequila sunsets, stowaways on midnight ships,
Refugees of romance plead asylum from the real.
Scrambling distress signals on random frequencies,
Forever repatriated on guilt laden morning planes.

We are pilots of passion sweating the flight on course
To another summit conference, another breakfast time divorce,
Screaming out a ceasefire, snowblind in an avalanche zone.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
The problems always seem to be, we're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.
This is the ricochet...

Are we trigger happy, happy, happy?
Russian roulette in the waiting room,
Empty chambers embracing the end.
Puzzled visions haunt the ripples of a trevi moon,

Dream coins for the fountain or to cover your eyes.
We reached ignition point from the sparks of pleasantries,
We sensed the smoke advancing from horizons,
You must have known that I was planning, considering an escape.

Stand straight, look me in the eye and say goodbye, say goodbye.
Stand straight, we've drifted past the point of reasons why.
Yesterday starts tomorrow, tomorrow starts today,
And the problems always seem to be,
We're picking up the pieces on the ricochet.

Funeral hearses court the death of virginity
Was it paradise lost or paradise found?
Did we gain respect or were we holding ground?
You had found true love, or so you believed
And the wide boys tattooed your hearts upon their sleeves

So when you think it's time to go
When you think it's time to go
Don't be surprised, the heroes never show

And the patter merchants selling false impressions
Tipping eyes at the waitress with American expressions
Tie angels to the bar with sweet Martini's and their charms
They're lying on every word and every arm
They're turning down their noses to the best lines
And the cheap wines

Marillion,"Vodka intimate, an affair with isolation in a Blackheath cell
Extinguishing the fires in a private hell
Provoking the heartache to renew the licence
Of a bleeding heart poet in a fragile capsule
Propping up the crust of the glitter conscience
Wrapped in the christening shawl of a hangover
Baptised in the tears from the real
Drowning in the liquid seize on the Piccadilly line, rat race
Scuttling through the damp electric labyrinth
Caress Ophelia's hand with breathstroke ambition
An albatross in the marrytime tradition
Sheathed within the Walkman wear the halo of distortion
Aural contraceptive aborting pregnant conversation
She turned the harpoon and it pierced my heart
She hung herself around my neck
From the Time-Life-Guardians in their conscience bubbles
Safe and dry in my sea of troubles
Nine to five with suitable ties
Cast adrift as their side-show, peepshow, stereo hero
Becalm bestill, bewitch, drowning in the real
The thief of Baghdad hides in Islington now
Praying deportation for his sacred cow
A legacy of romance from a twilight world
The dowry of a relative mystery girl
A Vietnamese flower, a Dockland union
A mistress of release from a magazine's thighs
Magdalenes contracts more than favours
The feeding hands of western promise hold her by the throat
A son of a swastika of '45 parading a peroxide standard
Graffiti conjure disciples testaments of hatred
Aerosol wands whisper where the searchlights trim the barbed wire hedges
This is Brixton chess
A knight for Embankment folds his newspaper castle
A creature of habit, begs the boatman's coin
He'll fade with old soldiers in the grease stained roll call
And linger with the heartburn of Good Friday's last supper
Son watches father scan obituary columns in search of absent school friends
While his generation digests high fibre ignorance
Cowering behind curtains and the taped up painted windows
Decriminalised genocide, provided door to door Belsens
Pandora's box of holocausts gracefully cruising satellite infested heavens
Waiting, the season of the button, the penultimate migration
Radioactive perfumes, for the fashionably, for the terminally insane, insane

After all, you made your marks

One night you'll play Elizabeth Taylor
The next night you're Marilyn Monroe
Forever kissing frogs that think they're princes

One more experience, one more entry in a diary, self-penned 
Yet another emotional suicide overdosed on sentiment and pride 
Too late to say I love you, too late to re-stage the play 
Abandoning the relics in my playground of yesterday 
I'm losing on the swings, I'm losing on the roundabouts 
I'm losing on the swings, I'm losing on the roundabouts

I'm losing on the swings, losing on the roundabouts, the game is over 
Too late to say I love you, too late to re-stage the play
The game is over 
I act the role in classic style of a martyr carved with twisted smile 
To bleed the lyric for this song to write the rites to right my wrongs 
An epitaph to a broken dream to exercise this silent scream 
A scream that's borne from sorrow 
I never did write that love song, the words just never seemed to flow
Now sad in reflection did I gaze through perfection 
And examine the shadows on the other side of the morning 
And examine the shadows on the other side of mourning 
Promised wedding now a wake
The fool escaped from paradise will look over his shoulder and cry 
Sit and chew on daffodils and struggle to answer why?
As you grow up and leave the playground 
Where you kissed your prince and found your frog
Remember the jester that showed you tears, the script for tears 
So I'll hold our peace forever when you wear your bridal gown 
In the silence of my shame the mute that sang the sirens' song 
Has gone solo in the game, I've gone solo in the game
But the game is over 
Can you still say you love me

Slug-like fingers trace the star-spangled clouds of cocaine on the mirror

The tell tale tocking of the last cigarette
Marking time in the packet as the whisky sweat
Lies like discarded armour on an unmade bed
And a familiar craving is crawling in his head

Just another comic actor behind a tragic mask

Just a little less painful here when my back's against the wall

It's too late, I found, it's too far, I'm in two minds

You scrawl out your poems across a beermat or two

And if my owners let me have some free time some day

So if you join me and get on your knees and prey

A companion in my madness in the mirror the one with the silvery hair

I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy 

In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks

Marillion,"Midnight suns bid moors farewell, retreats from charging dusk
Mountain echo, curfews bell, signal ending tasks
They place their faith in oaken doors, cower in candlelight
The panic seeps through bloodstained floors as Grendel stalks the night

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Wooden figures, pagan gods, stare blindly cross the sea
Appeal for help from ocean fogs, for saviour born of dreams
They know their lives are forfeit now, priestly head they bow in shame
They cannot face the trembling crowd that flinch in Grendel's name

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

As Grendel leaves his mossy home beneath the stagnant mere
Along the forest path he roams to Hrothgar's hall so clear
He knows that victory is secured, his charm will testify
His claws will drip with mortal blood as moonbeams haunt the sky

Earth rim walker seeks his meals
Prepare the funeral pyres
The shaper's songs no longer heal the fear
Within their eyes, their eyes

Silken membranes span his path, fingerprints in dew
Denizens of twilight lands humbly beg him through
Mother nature's bastard child shunned by leaf and stream
An alien in an alien land seeks solace within dreams
The shaper's lies his poisoned tongue malign with mocking harp
Beguiling queen her innocence offends his icy heart


Hounds freeze in silence bewitched by the reptile spell
Sulphurous essence pervades round the grassy dell
Heorot awaits him like lamb to the butcher's knife
Stellular heavens ignore even children's cries

Screams are his music, lightning his guide
Raping the darkness, death by his side

Chants rise in terror, free round the oaken beams
Flickering firelight portraying the grisly scene
Warriors advance, prepare for the nightmare foe
Futile their sacrifice as even their hearts must know

Heroes delusion, with feet in the grave
Lurker at the threshold, he cares not for the brave, he cares not for the brave

So you thought that your bolts and your locks would keep me out
You should have known better after all this time
You're gonna pay in blood for all your vicious slander
With your ugly pale skins and your putrid blue eyes
Why should I feel pity when you kill your own and feel no shame
God's on my side, sure as hell, I'm gonna take no blame
I'm gonna take no blame, I'm gonna take no blame

So you say you believe in all of Mother Nature's laws
You lust for gold with your sharpened knives
Oh when your hoards are gathered and your enemies left to rot
You pray with your bloodstained hands at the feet of your pagan gods

Then you try to place the killer's blade in my hand
You call for justice and distort the truth
Well I've had enough of all your pretty pretty speeches
Receive your punishment, Expose your throats to my righteous claws
And let the blood flow, and let the blood flow, flow, flow, flow.",Grendel

Wipe the tears from your eyes, wipe the sweat from your thighs

The match was rained off Saturday but the panel came in bright
And on Sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub

And on Monday you went to London
To pick the cheque up with your mum
You had a tux on, you had a tux on
The first time you had a tux on, lucky man

There's a photo on the mantelpiece, when you bought your first guitar 
And your girlfriend came to see you when you were the rising star
You knew your luck was holding when you filled the local hall
The first time and the last time that you thought you had control

You had a tux on, lucky man, you had a tux on
You got a tux on, tux on
Now you're touring stadiums, you've let it go too far
Standing with your manager, your back to every bar

Burning all your credit cards, chopping out the pain
Crowding into toilets with a host of your new-found friends
You got a tux on, nothing's changed, you got a tux on
Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on

It was eyes down in the parlour, they prayed it wouldn't rain
A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late

With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on

Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream

The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on

Marillion,"And it was morning
And I found myself
Mourning for a childhood
That I thought had disappeared

I looked out the window
And I saw a magpie in the rainbow
The rain had gone I'm not alone
I turned to the mirror

I saw you, the child that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

Hey you, surprised?
More than surprised
To find the answers to the questions
Were always in your own eyes

Do you realize
That you give it on back to her?
But that would only be retraced
In all the problems that you ever knew, so untrue

For she's got to carry on
With her life
And you've got to carry on
With yours

So I see it's me, I can do anything
I'm still the child 'cos the only thing
Misplaced was direction and I found direction
There is no childhood's end

There is no childhood's end
'Cos you are my childhood friend
'Cos you are my childhood friend
Oh, lead me on

Hey you, you've survived
Now you've arrived
To be reborn in the shadow of the magpie
Now you realize that you've got to get out of here

You've found the leading light of destiny
Burning in the ashes of your memory
You wanna change the world

You'd resigned yourself
To die a broken rebel
But that was looking backward
Now you've found the light

You, the child that once loved
The child before they broke his heart
Our heart, the heart
That I believed was lost

So it's me I see, I can do anything
I'm still the child
'Cos the only thing misplaced was direction
And I found direction

There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
There is no childhood's end
I am your childhood friend
Oh, lead me on",Childhood End? [Live]
Marillion,"A spider wanders aimlessly within the warmth of a shadow
Not the regal creature of border caves
But the poor, misguided, directionless familiar
Of some obscure Scottish poet

The mist crawls from the canal
Like some primordial phantom of romance
To curl, under a cascade of neon pollen
While I sit tied to the phone like an expectant father
Your carnation will rot in a vase.

A train sleeps in a siding
The driver guzzles another can of lager
To wash away the memories of a Friday night down at the club

She was a wallflower at sixteen
She'll be a wallflower at thirty four
Her mother called her beautiful
Her daddy said, ""A whore"".

The sky was Bible black in Lyon
When I met the Magdalene
She was paralyzed in a streetlight
She refused to give her name

And a ring of violet bruises
They were pinned upon her arm.
Two hundred francs for sanctuary and she led me by the hand
To a room of dancing shadows where all the heartache disappears
And from glowing tongues of candles I heard her whisper in my ear
""'J'entend ton coeur""
I can hear your heart

It's getting late, for scribbling and scratching on the paper
Something's gonna give under this pressure
And the cracks are already beginning to show
It's too late
The weekend career girl never boarded the plane
They said this could never happen again
So wrong, so wrong

This time it seems to be another misplaced rendezvous
This time, it's looking like another misplaced rendezvous
With you
The parallel of you, yo

On the outskirts of nowhere
On the ring road to somewhere
On the verge of indecision
I'll always take the roundabout way
Waiting on the rain
For I was born with a habit, from a sign
The habit of a windswept thumb
And the sign of the rain
It's started raining",Bitter Suite
Marillion,"When the taxis gather in mock Solemnity
Funeral hearses court the death of virginity
Was it paradise lost or paradise found?
Did we gain respect or were we holding ground? 
You had found true love, or so you believed
And the wide boys tattooed your hearts upon their sleeves 
So when you think it's time to go
When you think it's time to go
Don't be surprised, the heroes never show

And the patter merchants selling false impressions
Tipping eyes at the waitress with American expressions
Tie angels to the bar with sweet Martini's and their charms
They're lying on every word and every arm 
They're turning down their noses to the best lines
And the cheap wines

And the wide boys
They wear their love bites for their crimes",Waterhole (Expresso Bongo)
Marillion,"There's a line on her jeans that a ball-point made
From a careless mistake that she can't wash away
And there's a heart on her sleeve from a spill of red wine
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes
She named it after me

There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him
And he claws at the door to be let out at night
And she makes do without him, and she worries about him
She named him after me

So if you ever decide that you have to escape
And travel the world, and you can't find a place
Well, you could wind up believing
That paradise is nothing more than a feeling
That goes on in your mind
So if ever find out what that is
There's something you could do

'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again
I want to tell you
I'm gonna name it after you",After Me

Marillion,"I've got a photograph 
I took a picture of you 
I took your picture in front of my favorite view 

You play the part so well 
You look so sure and free
No one could ever tell that you belong to me

And 'cause you lie so well 
I've got to pin you down 
Under lock and key 
So you will always be in my collection

If you can't speak you can't lie 
If you can't run, you can't hide 
I know a place you can't die 
So no one lives inside 
My collection 

I want to capture you
I want to immortalize 
The way you play with your hair 
The way you flash your eyes 

I taste the air you breathe 
I taste the food you eat 
I keep your nails and hair 
And some of the clothes you wear

If you can't speak you can't lie
If you can't run, you can't hide 
And if you're dead you can't die

Marillion,"You landed in my life
Like a new and brighter light
That made all my past seem in the shadow
I always used to believe
That beauty was skin deep
But I need a new world to describe you

And the time that it took to take down the wall
Was the time that it took for me to fall
Hopelessly weak

No one can take you away from me now
Don't worry if they take me away
No one can take you away from me now
Don't matter how long we have to wait

The days before you came
Were really all the same
A greyness I used to call freedom
Endless nights out with the boys
The boasting and the noise
To think that I ever believed them

No one can take you away from me now
Don't worry if they take me away
No one can take me away from me now
Don't matter how long we have to wait

I don't care what they think
You're all I believe in
I carry you here
And there's something of you
In everything that I love

No one can take you away from me now
Don't worry if they take me away

Marillion,"Did you ever feel that just by jumping on a plane 
All your cares would drop away 
And you'd be born again 

Returning to a nature child
Happy wild and free 
But forgetfulness is a river 
And you know where the river leads 

Holidays in Eden 
Life before the fall 
See no, hear no, speak no evil 
Feel no guilt, feel no guilt at all 

Naked through the jungle
Mud between your toes 
Following the river
Where the river flows 

The creatures of the forest bid you 
""Welcome to the dark"" 
Nothing here can hurt you
Darkness has no heart

Holidays in Eden
Paradise regained 
See no, hear no, speak no evil 
Throw your past away 

You wake up one morning
Wondering who you are
There's a map of a new country up on the wall 
All your new lovers merge into one 
You've done everything under the sun 
There's a date on the air ticket 
And the money's gone 

Back in your own country
Nothing seems the same 
No one comes around at night
Or uses your new name 

Hearing silent whispers 
Old friends are acting strange 
No one wants to know you now
People say you've changed 

Holidays in Eden 
Life before the fall 
See no, hear no, speak no evil 
Feel no guilt at all 

Holidays in Eden 
Paradise and light 
Heaven loses you to this world 
Leaves you alone 
Kiss your home goodbye

Marillion,"Maybe you're just too upset inside

Maybe you've become too angry and too close to crying

Too upset inside 

How can it hurt if I don't understand
How can it hurt if I don't understand 

You're never gonna square with me I know 
So what is there to say? 
There's a million words that we could share tonight 
Why do you walk away? 
And I could write you off and it's over with

But everything inside me wants to heal your pain 
You won't explain, you won't explain.

It's happening again like the last time
I don't know how it happens, but I know what to do
Coming up from the ground, I think it's you

I will walk on the water

You sent me the red sun and the purple sky
Cirrus clouds and grins, atoms of roses
The power to do anything in the chaos of colors
And the fluttering of wings
You carry me up and I'm free again

Don't let anyone tell you this is impossible

From the shop on the corner

To a name and a number 
A house full of music 
And a hatful of wonder 

And some of the people 
That she thought that she knew 
Were never like this 
When she saw them at school 
She's never been anywhere like this before

She was in a back room 
Full of strange aromas 
And noises and candles

He took her to a garden 
Full of rain and silence 
And she could smell the soil and the trees 
And see the succulent light from the little fires in his eyes

Marillion,"A hundred nights of fun and games 
A thousand empty glasses 
I feel it change 
And stay the same 
As each day passes 

They invite me to their gatherings 
In the finer parts of town 
They seem attracted to my indifference 
The irony just knocks me out 

And I love them as if I love them 
And they reciprocate with ""help"" 
But I look up at these mirrors sometimes 
And I can't see myself 

They say that some are born to burn 
And some are born to give 
They say that people live and learn 
Some people only live and live 

You don't know that I come here 
But if you did, you would know why 
So we close our eyes 

You didn't notice me 
As I passed you on the stairs 
How could you ever guess 
Looking at my face 
How closely I share your taste 
How well I know your place 
Even the clothes you wear 
I've seen them when you're not there 

You say that you can win win win

Listening to you sleeping
I hear the darkness breathe
And the rain against the window

Cynical and jaded
All the stones are diamonds
All the blues are faded

Everything I've been through
All I've seen and heard
Spent so much of my life
In the spiritual third world

But you came and brought the rain here
Something waiting to happen
Something learning to fly
We can talk without talking

From inside to inside
I have waited to feel this
For the whole of my life
We took ourselves apart

We talked about our faces
You said you didn't like yours
I said I disagree
I keep the pieces separate

I clutch them in my coat
A jogsaw of an angel
I can do when I feel low
From emptiness and dryness

The famine of our days
Watch the heaves open
Wash it all away
You came and brought the rain here

Something waiting to happen
Something learning to fly
On the edge of exploding

Marillion,"On promenades where drunks propose to lonely arcade mannequins
Where ceremonies pause at the jeweller's shop display
Feigning casual silence in strained romantic interludes

Standing all your mates to another round
Laughing at the world 'til the barman wipes away the warm wet circles
The warm wet circles 

I saw teenage girls like gaudy moths 
A classroom's shabby butterflies
Flirt in the glow of stranded telephone boxes
Planning white lace weddings from smeared hearts and token proclamations
Rolled from stolen lipsticks across the razored webs of glass 

Sharing cigarettes with experience with her giggling jealous confidantes
She faithfully traces his name with quick bitten fingernails 
Through the tears of condensation that'll cry through the night 
As the glancing headlights of the last bus kiss adolescence goodbye
In a warm wet circle 

Like a mothers kiss on your first broken heart, a warm wet circle 
Like a bullet hole in Central Park, a warm wet circle 
And I'll always surrender to the warm wet circles 

She nervously undressed in the dancing beams of the Fidra lighthouse
Giving it all away before it's too late 
She'll let a lovers tongue move in a warm wet circle 
Giving it all away and showing no shame 
She'll take a mother's kiss on her first broken heart a warm wet circle
She'll realise that she played her part in a warm wet circle",Warm Wet Circles

You come here scratching at my door
Your pain and anger's in the howling dark
Of every corridor I walk

Tell me more about the trust you disrespected

Why did you hurt the very one that you should have protected?

In a life I used to live
But I have never seen these streets so fresh
Washed with morning rain

I have seen this face a thousand times
Every morning of my life
But I never saw these eyes so clear
Free of doubt and pain

Like the whole world has been made again

I have been here many times before
In a life I used to live...

And it's all because you made me see
What is false and what is true
Like the inside and the outside of me
Is being made again by you

And it's all because you made me see
What is false and what is true
Like the inside and the outside of me
Has been made again by you

Like a bright new morning
Like a bright new day
I woke up from a deep sleep
I woke up from a bad dream

To a brand new morning
To a brand new day

Marillion,"I think I have become one of the hollow men
As I shine on the outside more these days 
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside 
'Leaves a growing darkness in it's place

I think I have become one of the hollow men
I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out 
Hollow men have got you long before you realise 
The poison paralyses

I think I have become one of a pair of men
It's a feeling I've been having for some time
I look down upon myself and watch my movements 
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalised

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look 
Come and meet our friends 
Stand us in our silly clothes 
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks 
Watch us grin and grin 
See the lies behind our eyes ... 
See the will to win 
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin ...

Sit quietly and listen to the breeze ... 
The hollow and the lonely listen too 
Sniff the air for something we can use

We're thin hard and we rattle when we're shaken 

",The Hollow Man [Acoustic]
Marillion,"It all began with the bright light 
The bright light and the noise
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire

Touching and being touched 
A million loose ends to tie up
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock

The colours stand still
And then they move around 
Comin' in and out of focus upside down

Empty winter trees
How space feels Love of the soft ... flowers and the sky

One fine day 
The chaos subsides
Bleeds into awareness
And a lifetime of surprise

The beauty of your mother's eyes
The pain when you fall 
You drink it in and marvel at it all 
But you never really figure it out

You get used to it

The babble of the family 
And the dumb TV 
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets

Chemicals in the water
Drugs in the food 
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system

The attitude of authority 
The laws and the rules 
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school

The heroes and the zeroes 
The first love of my life 
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down when they're choosing the sides
I was never any good at it 
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it 
I got used to it

Alone in the city at seventeen 
With the hollow, the lonely 
The drowning and the drowned 
I was made to feel worthless 
The wretched and the mean 
Beat me up like a weapon 
I can't run away from or find a way round 
Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day 
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone 
Those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know? 
So get used to it Get used to it!

The clash of religions 
The loaded prayers 
Information 
The face of starvation and the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless 
And the fear to try 
Not believing the leaders, the media that feeds us 
Living with the big lie

You get used to it

Marillion,"Did you cry when they dragged you home 
Put a lock on the door and the telephone
Was a runaway girl all they could see ...
Have the nights and the days that you've come through
Made the right seem wrong and the false seem true
And was the runaway girl all they could see ...
A teenage extra from the satellite TV
Runaway girl
Too bad, too bad 
Runaway girl
Too wild, too wild
Were they deaf to the prayer behind your lies
Maybe they didn't dare to ask you why 
Was a runaway girl all they chose to see 
All they were prepared to admit to
Runaway girl
Too bad, too bad
Runaway girl
Areal wild child
So you cower in the towns forgotten places 
And you make your bed with unfamiliar faces
And at last you've got your freedom but that's all you've got
You're tryin' to make your mind up if you're better off
You pretend to wait for washing in some Laundromat 
But you're damned if you'll give them the satisfaction of you going back
You'd freeze to death before you'd share a roof with them 
And you'd starve before you'd let him get his hands on you again

And her wet hair hugged her body like a long-lost friend

Marillion,"Saw you walking on your velvet lawn
Is it lonely on the moon? 
You took a dive and swallowed all you could 
Did you drink too much too soon? 
Nothing left for you to fight about 
And no one wants to see you try 
The nearest neighbours are a mile away
Does the ocean hear you cry? 

Punching at the sky 
They say the King is losin´ his grip again
They said you´re bullet proof, they said you feel no pain 
It seems the hero is misunderstood again 

Is it love or is it surgery 
Makes her seem so ill at ease
As she´s begging you to please calm down
In her silk Armani on her knees

Did you carry out those threats I heard 
Or were you only playing macho?
And the stains on her Versace scarf
Were they really just Gazpacho? 

They say the King is watching his back again
They say the King is losing his grip again 
Raging like a bull to an empty ring 
D´you think they will forgive a hero anything?

Now the ring is just a band of gold 
And your wife needs police protection 
While you´re sparring with the journalists 
You´re trying to win back her affection 
Is this what it means to be a man 
Boxing up all your emotion
So now she´s gone and you´re alone at last
You can tell it to the ocean 

They say the King is losing his grip again 
They say the King is countin´ his numbered days
You never lost a fight in your whole life 
You never had no trouble sleepin´ through the night 
The bottle and the doctor get you through the day

These hearts of Lothian

It's 6 o'clock in the tower blocks
The stalagmites of culture shock
And the trippers of the light fantastic, bow down, hoe down
Spray their pheromones on this perfume uniform

And anarchy smiles in the royal mile
And we're waiting on the fly boys, sly boys, wide boys
Rooting, tooting cowboys
Lucky little ladies at the watering holes
They'll score the Friday night goals

Bell boys checking out the hookers in the bar
Slug-like fingers trace the star-spangled clouds of cocaine on the mirror
The short straw took its bow

The tell tale tocking of the last cigarette
Marking time in the packet as the whisky sweat
Lies like discarded armour on an unmade bed
And a familiar craving is crawling in his head

And the only sign of life is the ticking of the pen
Introducing characters to memories like old friends
Frantic as a cardiograph scratching out the lines
A fever of confession a catalogue of crime in happy hour

Do you cry in happy hour, do you hide in happy hour

You wouldn't understand
You're asking the wrong questions
You couldn't understand

A bridge is not a high place
The fifty second floor
Icarus would know
A mountain isn't far to fall
When you've fallen from the moon

There's murder on the street
I'm ashes on the water now
Somewhere far away
I have fallen, fallen, from the moon

Marillion,"Staring down from this high window
At the faces in the line
Cold from hours of waiting
How many people can you love?
When you're black and blue with bruises
From collisions on the road
The friction grind of traveling
This is the never ending show
All over the world in eighty days
Head in a blur of information
What kind of a man could live this way
I do what I can
I do OK
But right now
All I want to do is
Get real
If that's alright with you
Woke up last night under the mountains
Driving from Zurich to Milan
I lay there listening to the echoes
Thinking of Iceland and Japan
So many smiles So many faces
And my home so far away
I lose some of me in all these places
And I can't help the way I'm changed
All over the world in eighty days
Memories turn like magazine pages
What kind of a man could live this way
I do what I can
But I can't escape it
Right now
All I want to do
Is get real
If that's alright with you
Right now
All I want to do
Somehow
Be myself with you
All over the world in eighty days
Alcohol haze of information
What kind of a man could live this way
As long as I have
And stay the same
Right now
All I want to do is
Get real
If that's alright with you
Right now
All I want to do
Get real
If that's alright with you

Just try to understand

I could sleep for invisible years

Marillion,"There was a boy who came into this world
At the hands of a holy woman in a holy place
He wore a red coat and walked a bulldog
Saw them reflected in the mirror of the lakes
Lived in the shadow of the mountains
With the smells of disinfectant, dusty old leather
And the polished wood of his bed
No more than a baby feeding swans on the river
Holding the hands of his mother
And the wax paper bag of yesterday's bread

And his father on the other side of the world
On the ships railings and some far away tide
With the silent dry tear of home thoughts from abroad
In his far away eyes
In his far away eyes

The smell of the wax on the wooden floor
Mixture of polish and soap
No children to fear or to play with
Rows of empty hooks for the coats
An upright piano and the boys in the choir
Still remind him of just before he was born
Remind him of just before he was breathing
Strange misty visions of God
Turn the cities into families
Into villages of souls
Hovering in the air while they're sleeping
With their houses invisible
Chase the moon between the buildings
Running as fast as I could run
Send to me the ghosts of Christmas
Whispering, ""You're the only one""

And ever since I was a boy
I never felt that I belonged
Like everything they did to me
Was an experiment to see
How I would cope with the illusion
In which direction would I jump
Would I do it all the same
As the actors in the game
Or would I spit it back at them
And not get caught up in their rules
And live according to my own
And not be used, not be used
To find the fundamental truths
It was going to take some time
Thirty five summers down the line
The wisdom of each passing year
Seems to serve only to confuse
Seems to serve only to confuse

Daddy came out the navy and took us away
To his dirty grey home town
And he worked down on a coal mine for National Service
So that he could be around
There was a magical purple in the chrome of the exhaust
Of his Triumph motor bike
And a warmth of oil and metal and the thrill of the hard corner
Holding tight

From the horizon
Came home from the Navy to the mine
From the horizon
To buried alive
Took his dream underground
Buried his treasure in his faraway eyes

And one day as the boy lay sleeping in the sunshine
Of a half remembered afternoon
A cloud of bees with no particular aim, and no brain
Found the boy, decided that his time had come
Came down out of the sky
Stung him in the face
Again and again
Blue pain
Screaming like baptism
Intravenous, Jesus!
Like being chosen
Blue pain from something with no brain
I can't explain
It's happening again
It's happening again

Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you sit a while with me
Oh Mummy, Daddy, will you jog my memory
Tell me tall tales of Montego Bay
Table mountain, flying fish, banana spiders, pots of paint
And the sun on the equator
Setting like an ember thrown to deep water
From crimson to black
But coming back
Tomorrow
On the horizon

The blue pain
Fades to a point where it doesn't fade
It stayed
Blue
Stirred his red coat heart to this strange engine
This love

This love
This inconvenient, blind, blood-diamond
This puzzle
I don't understand
That knows no faith
And tries and fails
And tries again
Stares at the sea
The night's dark deep
For one last time
And bleeds
And bleeds
And dies for you
And lies
And is to blame
And is ashamed
And is not the same
And is true

I came with a mission 
To patch up a dream 
We walked and I talked and my words were absorbed
Into the answering machine 

I came two thousand miles
Just to take a look at you
But you were broken and frozen 
A heartbreak of a statue 
In the bullet-proof mirrors 
Where your eyes used to be 
I stared at myself and I called for some help 
Into the answering machine

The day slipped by and I tried and tried 
You took me home and you said
""Goodnight, Sleep tight"" 
On the floor by the bedroom door 
I watched you sleep and I left before first light

Echoes silently around the cold grey places 
Ecstasies undared 
Tremble upon the edge of the tightly, respectably unfulfilled 
Who drink to excess in order to forget what never happened

Well dressed ordered minds on suicide's edge
Reflected in the rain-skimmed slate grey, battleship grey, hardship grey

And the end

Marillion,"It all began with the bright light
The bright light and the noise
The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire

Touching and being touched
A million loose ends to tie up
Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock

The colours stand still
And then they move around
Comin' in and out of focus upside down

Empty winter trees
How space feels
Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky

One fine day
The chaos subsides
Bleeds into awareness
And a lifetime of surprise

The beauty of your mothers eyes
The pain when you fall
You drink it in and marvel at it all
But you never really figure it out

You get used to it

The babble of the family
And the dumb TV
Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets

Chemicals in the water
Drugs in the food
The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system

The attitude of authority
The laws and the rules
Hit me square in the face, first morning at school

The heroes and the zeroes
The first love of my life
When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down
When they're choosing the sides

I was never any good at it
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it

I got used to it

Alone in the city at seventeen
With the hollow and the lonely
The drowning and the drowned
I was made to feel worthless
The wretched and the mean
Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round

Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day
Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone
But those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know?
So get used to it
Get used to it!

The clash of religions
And the loaded prayers
Information
The face of starvation and the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless
And the fear to try
Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us
Living with the big lie

You get used to it
Get used to it!
It's okay, I got used to it",Living With the Big Lie (Album Version)

And what gets in between

Fix it in the usual way
Meet me at the church and we'll get in a state

A kid swingin' on heavens gate
With no God to complain
Or point the finger of blame
We'll get it all down on video 8
You comin' out to play?
Could be quite a day...

And I sang that pretty tune
An open airy song
And my heart looped the loop
Well I could do no wrong.

There's a stray dog she feeds that she found in the street

And the cradle rock

The colors stand still
And then they move around
Comin' in and out of focus
Upside down

Empty winter trees
How space feels
Love of the soft
Flowers and the sky

One fine day
The chaos subsides
Bleeds into awareness
And a lifetime of surprise

The beauty of your mother's eyes
The pain when you fall
You drink it in and marvel at it all
But you never really figure it out
You get used to it

The babble of the family
And the dumb TV
Roar of the traffic
And the thunder of jets

Chemicals in the water
Drugs in the food
The heat of the kitchen
And the beat of the system

The attitude of authority
And the laws and the rules
Hit me square in the face
First morning at school

The heroes and the zeros
The first love of my life
When to kiss and to kick
And to keep your head down
When they're choosin' the sides

I was never any good at it
I was terrified most of the time
I never got over it
I got used to it

Alone in the city
At seventeen
With the hollow, the lonely
The drowning and the drowned

I was made to feel worthless, the wretched and the mean
Beat me up like a weapon
I can't run away from or find a way 'round
Holdin' on, holdin' on

The greed and the missiles
Exploding somewhere every day
Hideous dark secrets under the sea
And in holes in the ground

The cold war's gone
But those bastards'll find us another one
They're here to protect you, don't you know?
So get used to it, get used to it

Oh, the clash of religions
And the loaded prayers
Information the face of starvation
And the state of the nation

The sense that it's useless
And the fear to try
Not believin' the leaders, the media that feeds us
Livin' with the big lie

You get used to it
Hey, you get used to it
It's okay, it's okay, you get used to it",Living With the Big Lie [Live]
Marillion,"Na nana na na na

A hand held over a candle in angst fuelled bravado
A carbon trail scores a moist stretched palm
Trapped in the indecision of another fine menu
And you sit there and ask me to tell you the story so far
This is the story so far, aaa aaa aaa

Shuffling your memories, dealing your doodles in margins
You scrawl out your poems across a beermat or two
And when you declare the point of grave creation
They turn 'round and ask you to tell them the story so far
This is the story so far, aaa aaa

And you listen with a tear in your eye
To their hopes and betrayals and your only reply
Is Slainte Mhath

Princes in exile raisin' the standard Drambuie
Paradin' their anecdotes tired from old campaigns
Holdin' their own last orders commanding attention
And we sit here and listen to all of the story so far
This is the story so far, aaa aaa aaa

Take it away, take it away, take it away
Take me away, take me away, take me away, take me away
Take me away

From the dream on the barbed wire at Flanders and Bilston Glen
From the Clyde side that rusts from the tears of its broken men
From the realization that all we've been left behind
Is to stand like our fathers before us in the firing line

Waiting on the whistle to blow
We stand here waiting on the whistle to blow
They promised us miracles, and the whistle still blows
Broken promises but the whistle still blows
Waiting on the whistle to blow
We stand here waiting on the whistle to blow",Slainte Mhath [Live]
Marillion,"You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather

But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done",Substitute [Live]
Marillion,"I lie awake at night
Listening to you sleeping
I hear the darkness breathe
And the rain against the window

After all this time
Cynical and jaded
All the stones are diamonds
All the blues are faded

Everything I've been through
All I've seen and heard
Spend so much of my life
In the spiritual third world
But you came and brought the rain here

Something waiting to happen
Something learning to fly
We can talk without talking
From inside to inside
I have waited to feel this
For the whole of my life

We took ourselves apart
We talked about our faces
You said you didn't like yours
I said I disagree

I keep the pieces separate
I clutch them in my coat
A jigsaw of an angel
I can do when I feel low

From emptiness and dryness
The famine of our days
I watch the Heavens open
Wash it all away
You came and brought the rain here

Something waiting to happen
Something learning to fly
On the edge of exploding
Something wild and alive

Something waiting to happen
Any time that you like
I have waited to feel this
For the whole of my life",Waiting to Happen [Live]
Marillion,"I've got a photograph
I took a picture of you
I took your picture
In front of my favorite view

You play the part so well
You look so sure and free
No one could ever tell
That you belong to me

And 'cause you lie so well
I've got to pin you down
Under lock and key
So you will always be in my collection

If you can't speak, you can't lie
If you can't run, you can't hide
I know a place, you can't die
So no one lives inside my collection

I want to capture you
I want to immortalize
The way you play with your hair
The way you flash your eyes

I taste the air you breathe
I taste the food you eat
I keep your nails and hair
And some of the clothes you wear

If you can't speak, you can't lie
If you can't run, you can't hide
And if you're dead, you can't die
So no one lives inside
No one lives inside my collection

Marillion,"Well, I hear that you were looking out to hunt me down
And I guess you're used to having everything you want
But you know that love can be hard as sticks and stones
I tell you nothing else can be as hard as love can

Well I hear you've got my number and you want my name
I'm a stream of oughts and crosses in your are A M
But you know that love can be as hard as algebra
Baby, nothing else has ever been as hard as love

Hard as love, hard as love
Hard as love, hard, hard as love

Well, I hear that you were lookin' out to take me home
And I hear that you can handle it and you're not scared
Have you heard about the pictures on my bedroom wall?
Baby, nothing else has ever been as hard as love

Hard as love, hard as love
Hard as love

Well, it makes you hungry and it makes you high
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry
But it's all worthwhile

It makes you humble and it makes you crawl
It makes you tremble and it makes you fall
But it's all worthwhile, it's all worthwhile

It makes you desperate and it makes you dream
It makes you dangerous and it makes you scream
But it's all worthwhile, just lie back and smile

(They will continue to love you
Even though the rest of the world hates you)

It makes you hungry and it makes you high
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry
It makes you panic and it makes you vain
It makes you primitive sick inside

It makes you angry and it makes you blind
It makes you guilty and it makes you lie
Tied up and beaten, spat out and eaten, suicidal
Nothin' ever been as hard, nothing

Well, I hear that were lookin' out to change my faith
You can bash me with your book of words, hammer me down
But you know that love can be as hard as six inch nails
Baby, nothin' else has ever been as hard as love

Hard as love, hard as love
Hard as love, hard as love

Hard as love, hard as love, hard

Marillion,"I think I have become one of the hollow men
As I shine on the outside more these days
I can feel the outside feeding on my inside
Leaves a growing darkness in it's place
I think I have become one of the hollow men

I think I have become one of the lonely
Now that everybody talks to me
I feel I have become one of the empty

Hollow men can stop you with the twinkling of an eye
Hollow men can take you without even reaching out
Hollow men have got you long before you realize

The poison paralyzes

I think I have become one of a pair of men
It's a feeling I've been having for some time
I look down upon myself and watch my movements
A blind eye sees the fragile vandalized

Watch this cold world dishing up these endless hollow men
Find us anywhere you look
Come and meet our friends
Stand us in our silly clothes
Put our batteries in
Line us up like fairground ducks
Watch us grin and grin
See the lies behind our eyes
See the will to win
We'll buy you and we'll sell you
But perhaps we'll save your skin

Sit quietly and listen to the breeze
The hollow and the lonely listen too
Sniff the air for something we can use

We're tin-hard and we rattle when we're shaken",The Hollow Man [Album Version] [Version]
Marillion,"She bought a bottle of cider
From the shop on the corner
They didn't stop her
Thought she was older

She took a bus ride
To a name and a number
A house full of music
And a hatful of wonder

And some of the people
That she thought that she knew
Were never like this
When she saw them at school
She's never been anywhere like this before
Everybody's so out of control

She was in a back room
Full of strange aromas
And noises and candles
That was where he found her

He took her to a garden
Full of rain and silence
And she could smell
The soil and the trees

And see the succulent light
From the little fires in his eyes
Pulling shapes out of the night
She was enchanted

Then it's twelve o'clock
And the last bus is gone
They're gonna go crazy
When they hear what she's done

And higher is lower
And less is like more
She's never felt anything
Like this before

And then it was yesterday

Gas up the 4 wheel drive!..

God bless America, I mean it
God bless the UK, I mean it
God bless our children
And God help us all",The Last Century for Man
Marillion,"But he who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

You have to be cool
You have to be hip
You have to be chic
You have to be rich
You have to be young
Whatever that is
You have to listen to what's in & what's happenin'

But
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

You have to keep up
Take the right drugs
Know when to be cagey
Know when to shut up
You have to talk fast
Know who to thank
Drive the right car to the right bank

But
He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.

Poison your life
As you turn the knife

He who dies with the most toys
Is still dead.",Most Toys
Marillion,"There's no such thing
As an answered prayer
There's no such thing
As the ozone layer
There's no such thing
As an action hero

There's no such thing 
As an easy ride
There's no such thing
As a place to hide
There's no such thing
As a perfect day

There's no such thing
As the pearly gates
There's no such thing
As an ordered world
There's no such thing
As an easy girl

No such thing
No such thing

There's no such thing
As peace-of-mind
As a faithful wife
As the bottom line
There's no such thing
As owning something
It's all borrowed for a time
It's all borrowed for a time

There's no such thing
There's no such thing
No such thing
There's no such thing
No such thing",No Such Thing
Marillion,"Air full of feathers
Fluttering distant laughter
Air full of signs & strange magic
Planets aligned in warning
Trap door sprung beneath me
And I'm falling
But I'm rising..
Downwards into blue sky
I'm rising

Downwards into blue sky
Re-entering the earth
Comet's tail behind me
Signaling a birth
The northern lights, all burning
Hot & cold at the same time
My spirit, white & liquid
And I have learned & I am learning
But I'm rising
Downwards into blue sky
I'm rising
Downwards into blue sky

I am the other half
And you are what I am for
I won't lie to you or hurt you
I'm not like that anymore

I am with you all the time now
One soul. One mind. One heart.
The other half cannot be parted
From the other half
From the other half",The Other Half
Marillion,"Looking at a star you?ve never seen before
Try to forget it
So you can see it
Tasted like you?ve never tasted it before
Try to forget it
So you can remember it

You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby

Love her like you?ve never fallen in love before
Fall out of love with her
So you can remember
And love him like you?ve never been with him before
Try and forget it
So you can remember it

You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby

You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby
You see it like a baby

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh 

You see it like 
You see it like 
You see it like a baby
You see it like
You feel it like
Feel it like
You touch it like
You touch it like
You touch it like
You touch it like?..
",See It Like a Baby
