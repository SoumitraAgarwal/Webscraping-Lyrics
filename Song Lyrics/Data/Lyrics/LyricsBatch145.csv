Glee,"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch!

You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel!

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch!

I wouldn't touch you with
A thirty nine and a half foot pole!

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch!

Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile!

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty-wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch!

The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
""Stink""
""Stank""
""Stunk""!

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch!

Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled up knots!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch.
With a nauseas super-naus
You're a crooked jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch!

You're a three-decker
Sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!","You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"

From sages

And where's that shiny car,

Glee,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
(But the tigers come at night)
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
(As they tear your hope apart)
As they turn your dream to shame

And still I dreamed that she'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [Version]
Glee,"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight
She enjoys the theater, and won't arrive late

Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls

And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard

You look like you're both pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual
That's not too abysmal
We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie

I'm glad we caught you at home
Could we use your phone?
We're both in a bit of a hurry
Right! 
We'll just say where we are
Then go back to the car
We don't want to be any worry

Well you got caught with a flat
Well how 'bout that
Well babies don't you panic
By the light of the night
It'll all seem alright
I'll get you a Satanic mechanic
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual, Transylvania
Why don't you stay for the night

Night! 
Or maybe a bite 
Bite! 

I could show you my favorite obsession
I've been making a man
With blond hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving my tension

I'll put up no resistance, I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch, I need assistance:

Toucha toucha toucha touch me, I wanna be dirty

I'll oil you up and rub you down

Chilled this room for twenty-four days,

Would've been good to go for lunch,
Couldn't agree when we were both free,
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.

Didn't, of course, 'til summertime,
Out to the beach to his boat could I join him?
No, this time it was me,

In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year!

“Need a break, this year's been crazy.”

I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly

Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river

I saw you and the world went away
Tonight, tonight there's only you tonight
What you are, what you do, what you say

Today, all day I had the feeling
A miracle would happen
I know now I was right

For here you are and what was just a world is a star
Tonight!
Tonight, tonight, the world is full of light
With suns and moons all over the place
Tonight, tonight the world is wild and bright
Going mad shooting sparks into space

Today, the world was just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than all right

But here you are and what was just a world is a star
Tonight!

Good night, good night

Dream of me, tonight",Tonight

She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind

She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice

Oh, oh
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine

Well I thought I knew you, thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, no no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know
Just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it

It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter

Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're going 'round playing the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame 'cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me
But that won't work anymore
No more, oh it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down

Made my skin a little bit thicker

Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go

So make the best of this test, and don't ask why

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the ""Goodbye""
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

Would emerge from Mister Monotony

“Have you got any monotony today?”

They got married as they should and around the neighborhood
She was known as Missus Monotony
They were happy as can be and they raised a family
Six or seven little monotonies

From another village came a snappy clarineter
She heard him play and strange to say she liked him better

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

Pinnacle of life
Husband joined to wife
The heart leaps up to behold
This golden day

Today is for Emma
Emma, I give you the rest of my life
To cherish and to keep you, to honor you forever
Today is for Emma
My happily soon-to-be wife

Pardon me, is everybody here? Because if everybody's here, I
Want to thank you all for coming to the wedding, I'd appreciate
Your going even more, I mean you must have lots of better things
To do, and not a word of this to Will, remember Will, you know, 
The man I'm gonna marry, but I'm not, because I wouldn't ruin
Anyone as wonderful as he is
Thank you all
For the gifts and the flowers, 
Thank you all,

Don't tell Will, 
But I'm not getting married today.

Husband joined to wife
The heart sinks down and feels dead
This dreadful day

Listen, everybody, look, I don't know what you're waiting for, 
A wedding, what's a wedding, it's a prehistoric ritual
Where everybody promises fidelity forever, which is
Maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard of, which is
Followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he'll realize he's
Saddled with a nut, and wanna kill me, which he should
Thanks a bunch, 
But I'm not getting married
Go have lunch, 
'Cause I'm not getting married
You've been grand, 
But I'm not getting married
Don't just stand there, 
I'm not getting married--
And don't tell Will, 
But I'm not getting married today.

Go, can't you go?
Why is no-
Body listening?
Goodbye
Go and cry
At another person's wake
If you're quick
For a kick
You could pick
Up a christening
But please
On my knees
There's a human life at stake! 

Listen everybody, I'm afraid you didn't hear, or do you want to
See a crazy lady fall apart in front of you, it isn't only Will
Who may be ruining his life, you know we'll both of us be losing
Our identities, I telephoned my analyst about it and he said to
See him Monday, but by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with
The other garbage
I'm not well, 
So I'm not getting married
You've been swell, 
But I'm not getting married
Clear the hall, 
'Cause I'm not getting married
Thank you all, 
But I'm not getting married
And don't tell Will, 
But I'm not getting married today.

Slipping down the drain
And bless this day in our hearts

I'm miles from home now, and you're so far away
I can smell the coffee, I can hear children playing
In a crowd in the station somebody's callin' your name
There's a note in the door of my hotel room 
A three word message, and it's signed by you 

Hold that thought, save that emotion 
Put it in your pocket, playback that sentence

And the junkyards and the highways come between us

Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind

And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Glen Campbell,"See her how she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pines
And then the darkness fell
And the moon's a harsh mistress
It's so hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face
Yes, I did, and I, I tripped and I missed my star
God, I fell and I fell alone, I fell alone
And the moon's a harsh mistress
And the sky is made of stone

The moon's a harsh mistress
She's hard to call your own.",The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress
Glen Campbell,"Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

[Chorus]
It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

Glen Campbell,"Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun;
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run;
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above;
Once they were part of an everlasting love.
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields.

Greenfields are gone now, parched by the sun;
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run;
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart;
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart.
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away.
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me,
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see.

I'm a freeborn man...

You may not like my appearance may not like my song
May not like the way I talk but you'll like me when I'm gone
I'm a freeborn man...
I'm a freeborn man...

Glen Campbell,"Why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
What have I done that's made you so distant and cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
Will you be happy when you are withered and old

I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
I cannot offer you all clothes that your young body crave
But if you'll say that you just love me and always be mine
Just think of the tears the heartaches and sorrow you'll save

While I am writing this letter I think of the past
And of the promises that you have broken so free
But to this old world I'll soon say my farewell at last
Cause I will be gone when you read this last letter from me",Last Letter
Glen Campbell,"Like a long lonely stream I keep runnin' towards a dream, 
movin' on, movin' on.
Like a branch on a tree I keep reachin' to be free, 
movin' on, movin' on.
 
'Cause there's a place in the sun where there's hope for ev'ry one, 
where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,
Got to find me a place in the sun.
 
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load,
movin' on, movin' on.
Like this tired troubled earth 
I've been rollin' since my birth,
movin' on, movin' on.
 
'Cause there's a place in the sun where there's hope for ev'ry one, 
where my poor restless heart's gotta run.
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done,
Got to find me a place in the sun.",A Place in the Sun
Glen Campbell,"She called me baby baby all night long used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I awoke and she was gone there's no more baby baby all night long
Well she called me baby baby all night long
She kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home and call me baby baby all night long

She called me baby baby baby all night long
She held me up so high when things went wrong

I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you

Hold me close, never let me go
Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme

Let me run outside and tell the cab to keep his meter flyin'
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind
No I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord
If you leave you're gonna leave a babblin' fool behind

Oh baby oh baby let me keep your suitcase off of the scales in time

Glen Campbell,"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

So far from home

Glen Campbell,"The Impossible Dream 
Performed by Glen Campbell 
To dream the impossible dream 
To fight the unbeatable foe 
To bear with unbearable sorrow 
To run where the brave dare not go 
To right the unrightable wrong 
To love pure a chaste from a far 
To try when your arms are too weary 
To reach the unreachable star 
This is my quest to follow that star 
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far 
To fight for a right 

Without question or pause 
To be willing to march into hell 
For a heavenly cause 
And I know, if I'll only be true 
To this glorious quest 
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest 
And the world will be better for this 
That one man scorned and covered with scars 
Still strove with his last ounce of courage 
To fight the unbeatable foe 
To reach the unreachable star",The Impossible Dream
Glen Campbell,"If time were not a moving thing 
And I could make it stay 
This hour of love we share would always be 
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light 
Make us realize our night
Is over

When you walk away from me there 
Is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun 
That rises o'er the land
I watch you walk away somehow 
I have to let you go now 
It's over

If you knew just how I really
Feel you might return and yet
There are so many times that people 
Have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way 
I have to force myself to say 
It's over

So I turn my back and 
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence 
Tryin' not to think at all
Send my tired feet before me
Walk the silent street before me

For you to scold me hurt me hold me darling take me back

Too late I've learned that you were not the cheating kind

Take me back...

They say you live and learn and though I've tried before
I promise never to be jealous anymore

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

'Cause she makes me feel like a great big man
I'm a gonna go tell her mama what I think about her say thank you ma'am

She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape
Of her neck she's packed like a seed in a grape she's smooth as marble skin
When I see her I believe I'm a real young guy
And every time I go to work I think I might die if I can't hurry home again

If the good Lord worked all night a makin' me a female plan
I'd say no thanks Lord I'll just keep Ann

Oh I feel so good when she takes my hand
I'm a gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her say thank you man

Glen Campbell,"Pity a man for he don't know
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road

When a man is one and twenty he thinks he knows it all
He can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall
But fall he will as he travels through life
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife

Now at 50 he's goin' real strong
He has him a family and a nice little home
But old age is creeping up his spine
And the day is comin' when the sun won't shine

Now at 60 he won't have to guess
He's already missed the boat that leads to success
But he's done his best and he can't see why
The fame of life just passed him by

Now at 70 he can see the light
And he knows he's never been very bright
But he's done his best as he's travelled by
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh

Pity a man for he don't know
The trouble he'll pass goin' down life's road

Now at 80 he's ready for the wreath
He's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet
And nothin' seems good to eat

So you can pity him as he goes up the line
As he wobbles on the spindle and his almost blind
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone
That it won't be long before he's goin' home

But if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life
He'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife
He's worked all his life to get things the way he wants 'em
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed",Fate of Man

At seven she'll throw a kiss towards the door and smile at my empty chair

Only a girl that's a stranger to me breathing on flames that are gone
Home isn't where I hang up my hat every night

And home isn't anything like cold arms holding me tight that's not right
And home isn't some place to go just to feel all alone that's not home

But the eagle flies on Friday night and my senses fly off too
How come every time I itch I wind up scratchin' you

I dream of coming home to you; a knight in shining armor

Glen Campbell,"Friends are never earned they're a gift from the loving God
And they're precious beyond human evaluation
But you dare not take them for granted or they'll lift away like a smoke
And the warmth of their caring will vanish into the chill of the endless nights
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town
Somewhere where nothing much ever happens
But a few of my friends are big people
They'd made the word ring with laughter down to this string of court
They're famous sensitive talented and their names are household words
And yet they're no more precious in God's eyes or in mine
Than those wonderful nobody's who live and die in small towns
Who is your friend he's someone who warms you with a nod
Or with an unspoken word in hard times when you're hurting beyond words
Who is your friend he's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair when no other medicine could possibly stop the pain
A friend is someone who clings his glass against yours
Or answers the phone at three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement and concern
Makes you realize that you're not really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common is their ability
To share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your deepest most spelling ol' some sorrows for they're all your friends",Friends

Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known",Today

You're not an angel

I'm not a king,
I'm a man,
Take my hand
We'll make a space
In the lives that we planned
And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're diff'rent worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game
You could have stayed
Outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay

Don't ask how

I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

Not like it's hurt me before

We'd get together in a family circle and sing out loud

Me and little brother would join right in there

I've lived a life that's full I traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew when I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
I've lived I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing

And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way

Look at our love from my point of view
And see all the hurt I'm going through
Just turn it around in your mind, turn it around in your mind.

Cause you know I'd swallowed all my pride for you

Well, I never thought that I could make it alone
Thought I would die but I seem to carry on
And I thought my life would surely leave
And, though almost, I have not ceased to be

And even though I thought I lost everything
Today I found that the birds still sing in the morning
And the world keeps spinning 'round
And the world keeps spinning 'round

When someone says goodbye, another dream ends
And just before you give up another dream begins
Someone changed their mind, tears fall to the ground
But you know that one man's smile is another's frown

And the table will turn someday, that's how life is
I have no doubt 'cause you know that time don't stand still
All the world keeps spinning 'round
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round

Dawn will find me here and I think about
One that I thought I couldn't live without
One day she was here, the next day gone
But the love that was never clear was just alone

And how can you lose something you only thought
That you found so you wipe away the tears with a smile
All the world keeps spinning 'round
Yes, the world keeps spinning 'round
All the world keeps spinning 'round
All the world keeps spinning 'round

That bompy little couch that made into a bed
Shower down the hall and footsteps through the wood
She said, ""It's just fine""

Times were hard for us for quite a while
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile
Not wanting me to know she's carrying my child
She tried to ease my mind

And for my woman's love, for my woman's love
Each day I thank the Lord above for my sweet woman's love

Through the years of moving town to town
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found
And wondering if we would ever settle down
Her love never died

And if I have many things today
I owe it to the love I had along the way
No matter what went wrong, no matter come what may
She stood by my side

Glen Campbell,"Where do you go when there's nowhere to go
And you don't want to be where you are
Where do you run when there's no run to run and you've already run too far
What good is love when you offer your love but nobody wants to buy
Why do I cry and why am I wondering why
What can you say when there's so much to say but nobody listens to you
And what good are dreams if there's no more than dreams
That don't have a chance to come true
And what can you do when love that you do will ease your troubled mind
And where do you go when you come to the end of the line
What can you say...

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I won't ever be set free as long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

If I could read your mind, love, what a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paper back novel, the kind the drug store sells
When you reach the part, where the heartaches come
The hero would be me, but heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again because the ending's just too hard to take

I'd walk away like a movie star who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene f bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it back

If you could read my mind, love, what a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like and o-old time mo-ovie 'bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong, with chains upon my feet
Girl, but stories always end
If you could read between the lines you'd know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feeling's that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way and I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong but the feelings gone and I just can't get it back",If You Could Read My Mind
Glen Campbell,"The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers
Inside a rain-drenched forest

But that was so long ago
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away
That I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground we walked upon
Those were good days

The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn spring
And summer and winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked away into the night

I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight
And she walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves

Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone, it lies forgotten
",Last Time I Saw Her
Glen Campbell,"I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you got to give so live and let live or let go
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover so you better think it over
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it matter

So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine girl there's gotta be a little rain sometimes

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap still water runs deep

And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while...",Rose Garden
Glen Campbell,"She understands me and she cares how I feel
Cause she's always there to hold my hand
Somehow she knows it when this old world's got me down
Yes she understands her man
We've seen the rain and the sunshine together
Many times she's watched me stumble and fall
And she's always there by my side when I need her
Through the good through the bad through it all
And though how it hurts me when her dreams don't come true
When I can't give her all the things I planned
But Lord it ain't easy and she knows that's light
Thank God for my woman she understands",She Understands Me
Glen Campbell,"When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise
And as its beauty struck the darkness from the sky
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be
And how lucky another day belongs to me

And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day
All its silent beauties seemed to say
So what my friend if all your dreams you have and realized
Just look around you you got a whole new day to try

Today is mine today is mine to do with what I will
Today is mine my own special cup to fill
To die a little that I might learn to live to take from life that I might learn to give
Today is mine

Like most men I cursed the present to avoid the peace of mind
And raise my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind
But as I view this day around me I can see the fool I've been
For today's the only garden we can tend
Today is mine...",Today Is Mine
Glen Campbell,"Today I may not have a thing at all except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you
Right now it may not seem like spring at all we're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow and all my tomorrows belong to you
No one knows better than I that love keeps passing me by that way
But with you there at my side I'll soon be turning the tide just away
As long as I've got arms to cling at all it's you I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream beg or borrow on some bright tomorrow will all come true
And all my tomorrows belong to you
As long as I've got arms to cling at all...




",All My Tomorrows
Glen Campbell,"Feeling of loneliness that I can feel right now
Love has looked at me but tried to change me
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.

Just for what I am I want someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old memory
Just for what they see just for being me

I want someone to love me just for what I am.
Cry ain't just a sound it's a sadness
Sadness that lives with me and follows me around
Love wants me to be someone I can't be
I wished that love would take me just for what I am.

Just for what I am I need someone to love me
Someone who won't expect me to feel like that old memory
Just for what they see just for being me
I want someone to love me just for what I am",Just for What I Am
Glen Campbell,"A lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
Are you going away with no word of farewell will there be not a trace left behind
I could have loved you better didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons of plenty for going this I know Lord this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
As I lie in my bed in the morning without you without you
Each song in my breast dies a borning without you Lord without you
Are you going away...

Just because I rang her number by mistake today she thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere

But if she's happy thinking I still need her then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish oh where would she get such an idea

Before I head home I make a stop along the way

Pawn shops itching for your old guitar
Where you've gone, it ain't nobody knows
The sequins have fallen from your clothes

Once you heard the Opry crowd applaud
Now you're hanging out at 4th and Broad
On the rain wet sidewalk, remembering the time
When coffee with a friend was still a dime

[Chorus]
Everything's been sold American
The early times are finished and the want ads are all read
Everyone's been sold American
Been dreaming dreams in a roll away bed

Writing down your memoirs on some window in the frost
Roulette eyes reflecting another morning lost
Hauled in by the metro for killing time and pain
With a singing brakeman screaming through your veins

You told me you were born so much higher than life
I saw the faded pictures of your children and your wife
Now they're fumbling through your wallet & they're trying to find your name
It's almost like they raised the price of fame

Her father thinks that I will leave her crying
But I know she would follow me right down the roughest road
Someday soon she'll be with me someday soon
And when I come to call her pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's cause he's just as wild in his younger days

That you belonged to me

But I know that I am just another man
And in knowing that I know that I'll get more or less what I can get

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

That weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married

As something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age

She closes her eyes and
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me

If you go away as I know you might there'll be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look I see on your face

If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away if you go away if you go away

And birds like tender babies in your hands

Someone left the cake out in the rain

There will be another dream for me someone will bring it
I'll drink the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking in the sun
But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire

And if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of narrow-minded people on the narrow-minded streets",Try a Little Kindness
Glen Campbell,"I was a highwayman.
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman
Glen Campbell,"Hey, hound dog man, 
Where you been now,where you been? 
I wish that you were back, 
It was too good to ever end. 
Once in a while someone like you 
Will give everything for what you wanted to do. 

Hey, hound dog man, 
My old friend play it again. 

You gave the world a whole lot of joy 
Now that ain't bad for a country boy 
I just knew you could not lose 
The way you sang rock and roll and blues. 
I still think about these things 
And the memory that it brings 

Hey, hound dog man, 
My old friend,play it again. 
Hey, hound dog man, 
My old friend,play it again 

Sometimes I think about James Dean, 
Sammy Cooke and my teenage queen. 
Doo ron, de ron, de ron, 
Marilyn Monroe and hot rod fun. 
I still think about these things 
And the memory that it brings. 

Hey, hound dog man,

My old friend why did it end?

Why I took this time to write
The cards and letters there's been to few of those
But I just stopped to realize
How long that I've been gone
But there's a few small things I need to know.

Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night?
Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light?
And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road?
I miss you so.

Well years keep slipping by me
Like miles out on the road
But I don't guess I'll change my way of life
There's no harm in holding memories
But please tell me if you can
If I can bring those old times inside.

Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars?
Do the roads still go for hours without cars?
Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door?
Just like before
Tell me more.

Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon?
Can you still reach out and touch the moon?
Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days?

Glen Campbell,"Faithless love like a river flows
Raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
And the night blows in like the cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love where did I go wrong
Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops falling on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes
Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love like a river flows",Faithless Love
Glen Campbell,"Here I am
Just an ordinary man
And my virtues are few
And I'm amazed
Every morning when I wake
With a lady like you

You're all the good things God put on this earth
And you're so much more than I deserve
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you

Look at me
I'm as common as can be
But do you make me shine
And look at you
You're a lady through and through,
So gracious and kind

And when you sleep, it's always by my side
I look at you and I'm mystified
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you

Heaven knows I'm less than perfect
And I have found the very best
But it's a mystery how someone like me
Was chosen to be blessed with a lady like you

I thought the world held not the joy for me
And even though we've drifted far apart
I never dreamed but what I dreamed of thee

I love you as I've never loved before
Since first I saw you on the village green
Come to me in my dreams of love adored
I love you as I loved you when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

I love you as I've never loved before
Since first I saw you on the village green
Come to me in my dreams of love adored
I love you as I loved you when you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen

Glen Campbell,"There are places I'll remember all my life,
Though some have changed.
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you.
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more.",In My Life
Glen Campbell,"Sailors have the seven seas and four strong winds that blow
Drifters have the next town down the road.

Soldiers have the hope of coming home.

And the flowers have the early April rain,
Believers have what they have never seen,
And the dreamers have tomorrow if today does not come true.
You have eyes that shine, and I have you.

Hermits have their peace of mind alone.
Lovers have each other and a small slice of the moon.
God still bless the child who has his own.

Are you on your own? 
Are you having fun? 
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad? 
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had? 

Does a day go by like a memory? 
Do you ever try to remember me 
In an automobile or a crowded bar? 
Well, I hope you're alright where ever you are 

And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio 
I just want you to know you were always my only choice 
And where ever you go then I still love you so, 
if you're still within the sound of my voice. 

In the dead of night, do you hear me call? 
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all 
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head? 
Was it really me talking to your heart instead? 

And if you are still within the sound of my voice 
watching this video, I just want you to know 
That it always made me rejoice 
Just to have you so near 
There's a place for you here 
If you're still within the sound of my voice. 

I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries 
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies 
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress 
but only you can send a lifeline out to me. 

Are you still within the sound of my voice? 
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong 
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will 
Are you still within the sound of my voice 

I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries 
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies",Still Within the Sound of My Voice
Glen Campbell,"Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And breaks into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are lookin' for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more

And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight
Somethin' that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is the thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mummy and daddy kiss
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
And the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.

He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found.
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around.
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be,
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me.

So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away.""
Down to the village,
With a broomstick in his hand,
Running here and there all
Around the square saying,
Catch me if you can.
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop.
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

Had to hurry on his way,
But he waved goodbye saying,

Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrow share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
So take it to the Lord in prayer

Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Everything to God in prayer

Glen Campbell,"By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall, that's all.

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go.",By the Time I Get to Phoenix [Live]
Glen Campbell,"People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe

My one and only prayer is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you
No one will ever know how much I love you so
My only prayer will be someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true, my life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring, my all, my everything
My heart I can't control, you rule my very soul
My prayer, my hope, and my schemes, you are my every dream
But it's only make believe

My one and only prayer, is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true, my one and only you
No one will ever know just how much I love you so

Please come to LA to live forever
California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
Livin' up on the hill

Glen Campbell,"Only one life
Just a tiny spark
But now that he is gone
I am somewhere in the dark

On this planet, tell me then
How could only one life
Leave such a mark on me?

One life, how could I have known?
One life could be such a part of me
As precious as my own
Only one life

Only one life, what does it mean?
It's only birth and death
And everything between

If livin' is a pointless truth
Just existence, nothing more
Why does only one life
Leave such an empty space?

One life, make it right or wrong
One life, take the love I can't replace
That always will be known to only one life

Just another sore monsoon here
So who cares if one should fall?
There were small world full of magic when he
Touched the wall, we change it all
With only one life

We only have once chance to find
But if we live it right
All we need is one life to make a difference here

Glen Campbell,"And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've lived, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got if not himself then he has not
To say the things, he truly feels and not the worlds of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way
Yes, it was my way",My Way [Live][#]

When you got no man to give it his last name

So she took her child and caught an evenin' train.

At least it buys her baby milk to drink
He once told her she was pretty but the only ring it got her
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink.

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played
But at least she didn't beg him
She'd rather wash her dishes
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean.

At night she stands there thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how her folks just turned away the shame
She stares down through the soap suds
Reaches down and pulls the drain plug
And watches as Manhattan drains away.

But other's have known few battles are won alone

Someone who's kind, someone who is fearless like you
The pain of it will ease a bit
When you find a man with true grit

One day you will rise and you won't believe your eyes

Glen Campbell,"I was alright for a while, I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello

Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell
That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Since you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

It's hard to understand that the touch of your hand can start me crying
I thought that I was over you but it's true so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling, what can I do for you?
No, don't love me and I'll always be

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone but from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, oh crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying over you",Cryin'

My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again

Glen Campbell,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a Manger
Glen Campbell,"The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay,
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Glen Campbell,"As I walk these narrow streets where a million passin' feet are before me
With my guitar in my hand suddenly I realize nobody knows me
Well yesterday the motor toots screamed and cried my name out for a song
Now the streets are empty and the crowds they go on home

With the rain on my face there's no place where I belong
And my whole life consists of a story of poem at a song
Now the truths I've tried to tell you are as distant as the moon
More than hundred years too late two hundred years too soon

I'm a child of the sage Lord's been in the pages of a book
But when I'm dust and clay where other people stop and to look
And will they marvel and miracles and perform into the high size to the spider
Oh will they take the pages of the book to light of fire
With the rain on my face there's no place where I belong",Folk Singer
Glen Campbell,"Love is like a warm and tender rain
Splashin' on the roof
Beatin' on the window pain

She was like a soft and gentle breeze
Seemin' so sincere
Pretty as you please

Though the time we spent together was so small
I keep wondering if I'll pull through it all
But the way you held me close and call my name
The pain I'm feelin' now
Tells me love is not a game

Every time I looked into her eyes
I couldn't really see
What was on her mind
'Cause she'd been through this many times before
I never realised I must have been a bore

Now I believe in love to be
Just simple truth and harmony
Happiness both day and night
No one wrong or right

And the pain I'm feelin' now
Tells me love is not a game",Love Is Not a Game
Glen Campbell,"Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice cream castles in the air
Feathered canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
Now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone

So many things I could have done, but clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now from up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusion I recall, I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels. The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairytale comes real. I've looked at love that way
Now that's just another show we've been laughing when you go

If you care don't let them know don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now from give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusion I recall I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I'd look at life that way
Now old friends are acting strange. They shake their heads they say I've changed

But something's lost and something's gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now from win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusion I recall. I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Glen Campbell,"And I love you so, the people ask me how
How I've lived till now, I tell them I don't know
I guess, they understand, how lonely life it's been
But life began again the day you took my hand

And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evenin' get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too, your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free, I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief and watch the pages with
All but love is there, that is my belief

And yes, I've known, how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I won't let the evenin' get me down

Glen Campbell,"I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around....
And around and around and around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman [Live]

My friend I'll say it clear, I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

I've lived, I've laughed and cried, I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me I did it my way

Of how they were answered by you 

But there never seems to be enough time

Glen Campbell,"There is someone walking behind you, 
Turn around, look at me. 
There is someone watching your footsteps, 
Turn around, look at me 

There is someone who really needs you, 
Here's my heart in my hand. 
Turn around, (turn around), look at me, (look at me,) 
Understand,understand, 

That there's someone who'll stand beside you. 
Turn around, look at me. 
And there's someone who'll love and guide you. 
Turn around, look at me. 

I've waited, but I'll wait forever for you to come to me. 
Look at someone (look at someone) 
Who really loves you, yeah, really loves you. 
Turn around, look at me.","Turn Around, Look at Me [New Version]"
Glen Campbell,"There's nothing like the warmth of a summer afternoon
Waking to the sunlight, being cradled by the moon
Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

So if there's anything I've learned from this journey I am on
Simple truths will keep you going, simple love will keep you strong
'Cause there are questions without answers and flames that never die
And heartaches we go through are often blessings in disguise
So thank you, Lord, oh thank you, Lord
And yeah, how could I ask for more? Oh",How Could I Ask for More
Glen Campbell,"I am weak but thou art strong,
Jesus, keep me from all wrong,
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to thee.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Through this world of toils and snares,
If I falter Lord, who cares,
Who with me my burden shares?
None but thee, my dear Lord, none but thee.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

When the journey here is o'er,
Time for me will be no more,
Guide me to thy distant shore,
To thy shore, O dear Lord, to thy shore.

Just a closer walk to Thee,
Jesus grant my humble plea!
Daily walking close to thee,
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.",Just a Closer Walk With Thee
Glen Campbell,"Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow.
But if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow.
Lean on me, when you're not strong and I'll be your friend.
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody
to lean on.
Please swallow your pride, if have things you need to borrow.
For no one can fill those needs that you won't let show.

You just call on me brother when you need a hand.
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand.
We all need somebody to lean on.

Lean on me when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend.
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna' need
somebody to lean on.

You just call on me brother if you need a friend.
We all need somebody to lean on.
I just might have a problem that you'll understand.

If there is a load you have to bear that you can't carry.
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load if you just call me.

Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me",Lean on Me
Glen Campbell,"Name your price,
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a shortcut, I'd have found it
But there's no easy way around it.

[Chorus]
Light of the world, shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all, set us free
Love is the answer.

Who knows why,
Someday we all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls

And we are never heard,
It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world.
People turn their heads and walk on by
Tell me is it worth just another try ?

[Chorus]

Tell me, are we alive or a just a dying planet ?
What are the chances ?
Ask the man in your heart for the answers.

And when you feel afraid, love one another
When you've lost your way, love one another
And when you're all alone, love one another
And when you're far from home, love one another.
And when you're down and out, love one another
And when your hope runs out, love one another
And when you need a friend, love one another
And when you're near the end, love
We got to love
We got to love one another.",Love Is the Answer
Glen Campbell,"I was sinking deep in sin, 
Far from the peaceful shore, 
Very deeply stained within, 
Sinking to rise no more. 
But the Master of the sea 

Heard my despairing cry, 
>From the waters lifted me. 
Now safe am I. 

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
When nothing else could help, 
Love lifted me. 
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
When nothing else could help 
Love lifted me. 

Souls in danger look above 
Jesus completely saves 
He will lift you by his love 
Out of the angry waves 

But the master of the sea 
Billows His will obey 
He your saviour wants to be 
Be saved today 

Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
When nothing else could help, 
Love lifted me. 
Love lifted me! Love lifted me! 
When nothing else could help

Glen Campbell,"Mary did you know that your baby boy will some day walk on water?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered, will soon deliver you

Mary did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when your kiss your little baby, you have kissed the face of God

Oh Mary did you know 

The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak, the praises of the lamb 

Mary did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation?

Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?

Glen Campbell,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross

With our toys scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found an answer for
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for

Comin' through the doorI can feel it 
Creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceilin' up above

All of my life my heart's been walked on
Women said they loved me my  how they talked on
Tellin' me lies
And fillin' my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold of myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin' to pull the wool over my eyes
I found you then the skies turned blue
I'm livin' in a house of love
Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit
I couldn't find love the blues were a habit
A lonely man and I couldn't understand
Why everything I tried went wrong
'Til you came along bless your heart and showed me
The right wayYou dried my eyes and turned my night to day
And I'm so proud I wanna holler out loud

Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes

But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight

Since you said so long left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep

And smokin' big cigars,

I know I can't be free,

Cut my lifeline when drifting through space.

I floated away.
Cross an ocean,
I dreamed her name.

Sing one to make me smile.
Another round for everyone,

I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days

These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I'll keep on moving
I'm bound to be improving these days
These days

And if I seem to be afraid to live the life
That I have made and sown
It's just that I've been healing so long

I've stopped my dreaming
I don't do too much dreaming these days

These days I sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
I've not forgotten them",These Days

It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I am, I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

It's times like these you give and give again

Lots of time to spend with you

I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do what other people do

I've trusted in the words that to my face turned out were lying
I've trapped and I have tripped and I have loved and I've abandoned
Each breath I take is a gift that I will never take for granted

I have washed upon the shore I've fallen, conquered demons
I've broken down and broken up without a rhyme or reason
I've held the ring of brass and many times smashed it to pieces

'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man

Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride

Glen Campbell,"Dear friend of my mine
Weather's fine
Today, I saw some ruins
Of the Roman world's decline

And I climbed all those Spanish steps
You've heard of them no doubt
But Rome has lost its glory
I don't know what it's about

I wish you were here
When the shadows fall
And all the rushing traffic's still

I wish you were here
When the bells are ringing
On the seven hills

I make my way to a small cafe
I wonder what you did today
Wish you were here

Dear one at home
I just flew in from Rome
And Paris is a postcard
All decked out in color chrome

And so, I climbed the Eiffel Tower
And prayed at Notre Dame
But I just can't find the romance
And I wonder why I came

I wish you were here
On the Champs Elysees
Lovers walk hand in hand

I wish you were here
They take one look at me
And seem to understand

This city of light is a lovely site
The first bright star I see tonight
Wish you were here

Now, I write this from the plane
Drinking cheap champagne
And wondering why
Two people got so far apart

I wish you were here
Here in London
Where the rain the pouring down

I wish you were here

Headed back to New York Town

You need a nice warm place to stay
A sense of humor cause life is funny
A big stick to keep the wolves away

You need a car with good tires on it
And the right place to eat barbecue
A heavy duty set of jumper cables
And no holes in your walkin' shoes

The main thing you gonna find you need
Is a fertile place to plant the seed now

You got to find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share it with and be part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I recommend you get some life insurance
Be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
And stay away from the man with a gun

You need a reason to get up in the morning
Make sure your clock has a snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can sure get cold

You're gonna find out sooner or later
You need a common denominator

You got to find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share it with and be part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

Glen Glenn,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana,
Rode into town one day.
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,
And walkin' behind was a bay.
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder,
And his lips, they were sad and tight.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was heavy as night. 
Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window,
An' watched as he passed her way.
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,
But cast greedy eyes on the bay.
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony,
Meant more to him than life.
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin',
Had ridden when she was his wife.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern,
An' looked up the stranger there.
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money,
He just didn't seem to care.
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion,
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay.
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her,
She never heard anyone say:

""Don't cross him, don't boss him.
""He's wild in his sorrow:
""He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
""Don't fight him, don't spite him;
""Just wait till tomorrow,
""Maybe he'll ride on again.""

The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset;
The stranger went free, of course.
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman,
Who's tryin' to steal your horse.
Tthis is the tale of the red headed stranger,
And if he should pass your way,
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion,
And don't lay a hand on the bay.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow:
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him;
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

How can I face them?
What can I say?
Lets make up sweetheart,
We cant stay apart.

Don't let foolish pride
Keep you from my side.

How can love like ours be ended?
Its the talk of the town.",It's the Talk of the Town
Glen Gray,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,
The corn is as high as an elephants eye,
An' it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the cattle are standin' like statues,
All the cattle are standin' like statues,
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,
But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin',
Oh, what a beautiful day.
I got a beautiful feelin'
Ev'erything's goin' my way.","Oh, What A Beautiful Mornin'"
Glen Gray,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man
Glen Gray,"You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Thin or fat, young or old;
Shake their shoulders bold.
You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!

Glen Gray,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Glen Gray,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Glen Gray,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Glen Gray,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You
Glen Gray,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.
Those farewell blues make me yearn,
That parting kiss seems to burn.
Farewell, dearie, Someday I will return.
Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.
 

",Farewell Blues
Glen Gray,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?

And you know darn well
It's you again
You said last night
We were through again
And now, I'm blue again

I'm alone again

I'm out around on my own again
There's a mockingbird that's flown again
And I'm alone again

I love you more every day, babe
Though I aggravate you

I may be wrong but I think you're swell

Glen Gray,"Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?

Glen Gray,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Glen Gray,"Carry me back to old Virginny,
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow,
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime,
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go,
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.

Carry me back to old Virginny,
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away.

Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore,
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.",Carry Me Back to Old Virginny
Glen Gray,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Glen Gray,"My heart tells me this is just a fling
Yet you say our love means everything
Do you mean what you are saying?
Or is this a little game you're playing?

Should I believe my heart or you?",My Heart Tells Me
Glen Gray,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Cry alone, and die alone
Pray alone, and stay alone

And I wish God would send me a word send me something I'm afraid to lose
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives
I get shivers down my spine and all I wanna do is hold you tight

Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street
Tonight there's calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat.
Let them go, let them go, let them go do their dances of the dead (let 'em go right ahead)
And dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon c'mon let's go to bed, 

Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now
'Cause you've got, you've got, you've got my love girl, you've got my love girl

Glen Hansard,"The only way to hold on to this love is with an open hand.
You told me that the first day we met. I didn't understand.

Beneath the broad-beamed boughs, your love changed: a slow coming apart.
You moved on and I stayed the same. I was trailing from the start.

We laid long in the tall grass. We loved for the joy of love itself.
We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else. 
And we wished for nothing else.

And through the crossbeams whispers were heard: undoing in every line.
And in the fall you flew little bird but I'll see you when it's time.

We laid long in the tall grass. We loved for the joy of love itself.
We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else.

""Get into the Vega now and I'll go get my shotgun""
It was a military holiday and kids were everywhere
I hid behind the steering wheel and tried to disappear
I tried to speak but couldn't, Dad was whistling and drinking beer
And I prayed ""Dear God, if You save this dog
""I will never get high, I will never jack off
""I will be all the things that I should but have not
""I'll be a good boy from now on""
We turned around the corner soon and saw the neighbor's yard
Dad lit up a cigarette and rolled his window down
And grinning like an idiot he stuck his head and body out

Well he popped in a shell and took aim with the gun
Then a flash an a bang and the dog it was gone
Jumped up and he ran away
Dad had shot right through his chain
Dad said ""Take me to the Dairy Freeze, I want to have a shake""
We sipped them on the benches there and stared out on the lake
And Dad has never said another word about that day
And I hope you're not disappointed, God
'Cause I still get high and I still jack off

I'd be a fireball come crashin', leavin' nothing but ashes
A bald spot on the globe like nothing ever had happened here",My Own Town
Glen Phillips,"Well it took five neighbors
To get him in the hall
And down the three flights of stairs
Out the building's door
I know that it's easy to say
That it couldn't be worse
But now she's in her apartment

Alone for the first time since the last jerk
And once you let them get to you
It never washes off
'Cause they can smell the weak ones
And just pick you off like a pigeon
And each one is worse than the last one
Until you're a professional victim

You get everything backwards
Learning how to survive
You treat the little wounds first
Let the big ones fester for life
You've done it enough
You would think that you know what you need
But it doesn't get any better
When you've got such an eye for the bad seed

And if you take a look you can see the cracks
In the story told where the logic lacks
All the pretty girls and the stupid boys
Make the same mistakes until they've got no choice",Professional Victim
Glen Phillips,"There comes a time in life
To pull on your coat and go outside
To taste the vinegar of life, bitter life
To taste a second time, its sweet surprise
Sweet surprise

It's not that hard to figure it out
When there's no question, there's no doubt
I burned an effigy to time, senseless time
To view the miracle, but the wine still was wine
And that was my crime

There is a face in the stone
We let it out to find its form
To shape the testament of will, strongest will
Pride, humility, a bitter pill
Bitter pill

Sweet surrender, oh my Lord
I never thought I'd see
Not surprising, still I find
I'm shaking, crying
But I'm laughing, softly

You could've been happier given the time

You'd give yourself to anybody
Who would cross that line

[Chorus]
And it was never a question
He was (you were) crowing for repair
You'd give him love and affection
You couldn't keep him there

Get over regret
While you were sleeping with the angels
He was under the bed
And the more skin you shed
The more the air in your throat would linger
When you call him your friend

Staring at a cold little hand
Reading fault lines of a smell of a man
You were waiting for a word from above
Wouldn't you know it, no answer ever did come",Crowing
Glen Phillips,"Is it this place that makes me fall from you
Forget the words that once rang so true
Did we expect that life was ever fair, my god...
I sowed a field of rose and reaped a whipping rod

And everything I've held too tight inside
Could make a part of me die
And if my lips could only speak the name
The dam would break

What is this ice that gathers 'round my heart
To stop the flood of warmth before it even starts
It would make me blind to what I thought would always be
The only constant in the world for me

And every hour of every day
I need to fight from pulling away
And if my mind could only loose the chain
The dam would break
For all the things I hid away
And all the words I could not say
The dam would break",Dam Would Break
Glen Phillips,"I've got gardens growing, got quiet days
Clothes on my back, food on my plate
Got friends to help me if I call for them
I don't need anything that I don't have

I've got eyes to see this beautiful land
And feet to take me where I want to stand
If there's work to be done
There's these two strong hands
I don't need anything that I don't have
I don't need anything that I don't have

Some years the rains don't come
And some years floods clear out the plains
If those waters washed this town away
I would still have enough
If she was with me

I've a roof overhead, the stars if I choose
But I've got no itch to fly, got no need to move
Got almost nothing
But I understand
That I don't need anything that I don't have

Glen Phillips,"I was 18 and so were you
I was that birkenstock geek rock dude
You were the back flip, doe-eyed,
Tree-climbing, earth-mama, beautiful evergreen girl

And I never thought that I could be
Gettin' my grey hair with you beside me
And there's something I'm blind to but you still see

And it couldn't be better, I know
It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall

I wanna be the toy in your cereal box
I wanna be Charter in your peace talks
I wanna get almost too familiar
But still notice the way that you walk

If you said you were going away
I'd run on the tarmac
And I would lay down in front of the plane
Just to get you to stay

'cause it couldn't be better, I know
It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall

Got everything I'd ever wanted here
Everything, then this constant fear
I'm sure I'm gonna lose it all
Just waiting for the other boot to fall

If you thought I could be replaced
I wouldn't just stop w/ an ear
I would cut off my whole fuckin' face
Just to make my point clear

That it couldn't be better, I know
It shouldn't be easier to hold
I should stop waiting for the other boot to fall
I'm waiting for the other boot to fall

Some take the road to Hell

Tongue of a liar, little recollection
And there's no use in keeping score
Cause no one plays fair anymore

And the voices trailing doubt
Are finally fading out
Finally fading

Gave all the right answers to all the wrong questions
And you burned a few bridges when the raised objections
And I probably shouldn't think out loud
But it's too late to take it back now

And the voices trailing doubt
Are finally fading out

Glen Phillips,"If I'd been dreaming
Wouldn't you just wake me
Senseless sleeping
You were always waiting

Doubt come slowly
It surely overtakes me
Am I among the lonely
You were always waiting

It it falling apart
Should I believe
You could be thinking that about me
Is this your faith
Is this your trust
Have you just given up

All our friends are retreating
Dreaming of escaping
Oh, hurry up they're leaving
You were always waiting

It it falling apart
Should I believe
You could be thinking that about me
Is this your faith
Is this your trust
Have you just given up on me
Have you just give up

We've all been here before
I'm sure you wanted more
I'm sure I could have given it
And whatever your intention was
We made it this far because
You were always waiting, waiting

Well I'd like to think I'd help you
If you needed saving
But I'm drowning here, not waving
And still you're only waiting

It it falling apart
Should I believe
You could be thinking that about me
Is this your faith
Is this your trust
Have you just given up on me
Have you just given up
Have you just given up on me
Have you just given up
Given up

Glen Washington,"Breaking up is hard to do

When you turned and you walked through that door
It hurts me sore, now
I said it hurts me sore, my darling
When you looked at me and you said, goodbye
You made me cry
I said you made me cry, my darling

So listen to me, what I say to you
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do

And saying, if you've ever been in love
Then you'll realize just what I'm talking about
Breaking up is so very hard to do
It's hard to do

I cannot let you go now
'Cause my love is so strong
My love is so, strong
I said my love is so, so strong

And if you leave I will surely cry
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows

Glen Washington,"Poor little dreamer
Stand inside the door
You can't find the easy rhymes
Of time you had before

It hurts my heart so bad
Seeing you sigh and shake
Broken down so low - so sad
I can't let you break

Cry to me - cry to me
You better not hide it
Let it come - let it bleed
I ain't laughing - reach in and get it
And set it free
Cry to me - cry to me

The glass is empty and the wine
Is bitter on your tongue
People don't seen wild and fine
Like when you were young

You're lonesome over a stormy ocean
Lost in the rain and wind
We can clear these clouds away
And feel the sun again",If You Need Me

He just told me so last night (Johnny loves her)
Now each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright (Johnny loves her)

Johnny's heart is really mine (Johnny loves her)
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine
I feel so pretty, I'm all aglow
When he says I'm wonderful
He makes me feel it's so
Yes, Johnny loves me
Now each day is bright and new (Johnny loves her)
And I only pray that I can say
For every day my whole life through

And this is what I said

Well-a, well-a, well-a, well-a
I washed all the dishes
And I did a lot more
I even bought the dinner
At the grocery store

Now, Mom, you'll find
The key next door cause
This little girl's gone rocking

I left some biscuits for the pup
I put fresh water in his cup
And now I'm off
I'm gonna live it up cause

Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering in the words, to melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem, Monalisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

Glenn Barbour,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Glenn Close,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye
Glenn Close,"Sure I came out here to make my name
Wanted my pool my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at Warners
But after a year

Of one room hell
A Murphy bell
A rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners

Sunset Boulevard
Twisting boulevard
Secret of the rich
A little scary
Sunset Boulevard
Tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary

Dreams are not enough to win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan
The battle rages
Smile a rented smile

Fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife
Kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages

Sunset Boulevard
Headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning
Sunset Boulevard
Jackpot boulevard
Once you've won, you have to go on winning

You think I've sold out
Damn right I've sold out
I've just been waiting 
For the right offer

Comfortable quarters
Regular rations
Twenty four hour
Five star room service

And if I'm honest
I like the lady
I can't help being
Touched by her folly

I'm treading water
Taking her money
Watching her sun set
Well I'm a writer

LA's changed a lot over the years
Since those brave goldrush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons
Far as they could go
End of the line

Their dreams were yours
Their dreams were mine
But in those dreams
Were hidden dragons

Sunset Boulevard
Frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion
Sunset Boulevard
Brutal boulevard
Just like you we'll wind up in the ocean

She was sinking fast
I threw a rope
Now I have suits
And she is hope
It seemed an elegant solution

One day this must end
It isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrow's execution

Sunset Boulevard
Ruthless boulevard
Destination for the stony hearted
Sunset Boulevard
Lethal boulevard
Everyone's forgotten how they started
Here on Sunset Boulevard",Sunset Boulevard
