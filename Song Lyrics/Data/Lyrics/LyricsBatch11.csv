Charlotte Church,"Over the ground lies a mantle of white
 A heaven of diamonds shine down thro' the night
 Two hearts are thrillin' 
 In spite of the chill in the weather
 Love knows no season, love knows no clime
 Romance can blossom any old time
 Here in the open we're walking and hoping together!

 Sleigh bells ring, are you list'nin'?!
 In the lane snow is glis'nin'
 A beautiful sight
 We're happy tonight
 Walking in a winter wonderland!

 Gone away is the blue bird
 Here to stay is a new bird
 He sings a love song
 As we go along
 Walking in a winter wonderland!

 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
 He'll say ""Are you married?""
 We'll say ""No, man! But you can do the
 job when you're in town!""

 Later on we'll conspire
 As we dream by the fire
 To face unafraid
 The plans that we made
 Walking in a winter wonderland!

 Sleigh bells ring, are you lis'nin'?! etc...",Winter Wonderland
Charlotte Church,"Most people live on a lonely island,
Lost in the middle of a foggy sea
Most people long for another island
One where they know they would like to be.

Bali ha'i may call you,
Any night, any day,
In your heart you'll hear it call you,
Come away, come away . . .

Bali ha'i will whisper,
On the wind of the sea,
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me . . .

Your own special hopes,
Your own special dreams,
Bloom on the hillside,
And shine in the streams . . .

If you try you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me, come to me . . .

Bali ha'i
Bali ha'i
Bali ha'i

Someday you'll see me,
Floating in the sunshine,
My head's sticking out from a low flying cloud . . .

You'll hear me call you,
Singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be . . .

Come to me, bali ha'i
Come to me
Come to me

Charlotte Church,"From the ""secret garden""

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
But is their bounty
What she needs

How can she chance
To love a little bit of earth
Does she not know
The earth is old
And doesn't care if
One small girl wants things to grow

She needs a friend
She needs a father
Brother, sister
Mother's arms
She needs to laugh
She needs to dance
And learn to work
Her girlish charms

She needs a home
The only thing she really needs
I cannot give
Instead she asks
A bit of earth
To make it live

She should have a pony
Gallop 'cross the moor
She should have a doll's house
With a hundred rooms per floor
Why can't she ask for a treasure
Something that money can buy
That won't die
When I'd give her the world
She asks instead
For some earth

A bit of earth
She wants a little bit of earth
She'll plant some seeds
The seeds will grow
The flowers bloom
Their beauty just the thing she needs

She'll grow to love the tender roses
Lilies fair, the iris tall
And then in fall, her bit of earth
Will freeze and kill them all

A bit of earth, a bit of earth,
A bit of earth, a bit of earth

Charlotte Church,"I wish I was in carrickfergus
Where the castle looks out to sea.
I would swim over the deepest ocean
For my love to be with me.
But the sea is wide and I can not swim over
Nor have I the wings to fly
I wish I had a handsome boatman,
To ferry me over, my love and i.

I wish I was in the land of arak,
Where the mountains reach the sea.
Where flowers blossom as I do remember.
Where my true love came to me.
But the sea is wide and I can not swim over.
Nor have I the wings to fly.
Ahh to be back now in carrickfergus
To be together .. my love and i.
To be together .. my love and i.

I wish I was in carrickfergus,
To be together my love and i.

I wish I was back home again.

Charlotte Church,"Under the dome epais Or the white jasmine A the pink sõassemble, On bank in flowers, Laughing in the morning, Viens, let us go down together. Gently let us slip; Of its charming flood Let us follow the Fuyant current; in Lõonde fremissante. Dõune hand nonchalante, Come, gain the edge Or the souree sleeps. And lõoiseau, Lõoiseau sings. Under the dome epais, Under the white jasmine, Ah! let us go down together

Charlotte Church,"From my first moment you gave me wings
Let me fly and believed in my dreams
From that first moment you cherished me so
The journey through life would be hard with out you

You gave me all I have and all I know
From my first moment you would be there
In your arms lay the strength I now bear
From that first moment each day I have you
 
As seasons they change but your heart stays the same
You gave me all I have and all I know

From my first moment as time goes by
Witness endlessly through open skies
The journey though life would be hard with out you
You gave me all I have and all I know",From My First Moment
Charlotte Church,"If I loved you, time and again
I would try to say all I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come
In an easy way, round in circles I'd go

Chorus:

Longing to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

My dear marquis, why must you be,
So loyal throughout your hours?

Bestowing my attention
With lofty condescension.

Are the traces of a pedigree.

May the light,
Illuminate the night, the way your spirit illuminates my soul

Papa, can you find me in the night? 
Papa, are you near me? 
Papa, can you hear me? 
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

Which ones are yours? 
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye and closed it's door? 
The night is so much darker,
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice? 
Can you hear me praying,
Anything I'm saying,
Even though the night is filled with voices? 
I remember ev'rything you taught me
Ev'ry book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead? 
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you

Tonight there will be no morning star

Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight
And for us, stars will stop where they are

Today the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
And still the sky is light

A place for me to live in
No better than alright

Is a star, tonight

And neither have I wings to fly
Give me a boat that will carry two
And both shall row... my love and i.

It grows and blossoms like a rose
It has a sweet and pleasant smell
No flower on earth can it excel.

The ship there is and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim.

Oh, love is handsome and love is fine
And loves a jewel when it is new
But rain it above it grows so cold
And fades away like morning dew.

The situation's just the same

He's given you nothing
But taken it all
You're taking the easy way out
I'll say it again like I've said it before
Stop taking the easy way out

Each night you call, more tears again
Time to accept he'll never change
It's your life, your choice, your own despair
But your burden's far too much to bear

You know the truth
You've heard it all
Just trying to catch you before you fall
See nothings new
The situation's up to you

You turn to me cause you can't see
That there's a better way to be
So close your eyes and say goodbye

You've got to give it up
Turn around, walk away
Don't look down",Easy Way Out

If I lied, I apologize?

Charlotte Church,"Now first of all I want to let you to know that
I've been known for some minor
Mood swings now and then
It all started back when people
Were doing me wrong
And because of my position I would
Hold my tongue for then
Bad relationships and people I thought were friends
And people judging me
Before they get to know a thing
When you decide to step to me,
It shows me so clearly
You just want to see, see the other side of me

And you don't know what I'm going through
And you might think it's all about you
But it's everything I've been holding back
It's just bad timing to come at me like that

I try to keep my cool, thus, that's what I try to do
But it's so hard dealing with people just like you
I try to walk away from situations that run
Into complications that make me loose control
If I give in to you then it's what you want me to do
And if I loose my cool then I'm only pleasing you
You know just how to push me,
My temperature is rising
Blood pressure is building, I'm about to loose control

I'm sorry, did I cross the line?
I tried to warn you away
Way ahead of time
I'm so frustrated I feel like I could cry
This could be the time

Will remain or pass us by
Some will climb
Some will fall
Some will rise above it all

Promises you make or break
Gone tomorrow, here today
Let it pass
Let it wait

Charlotte Church,"Something cracked inside me
On that Wednesday afternoon
We’d been numb as silent snow
We'd seen nothing but the moon
Mocking all the writing
I'd been forcing on the page
I've been dormant for too long now
Like I've been in hibernation
But I love you, you know
It's just I discovered
There's a life beneath the snow

I knew it could never have worked from the outset
That doesn't make this heartache easier to accept

Spending every waking moment
That I could with you
Now I'm wondering what you're doing
And I'm wondering if I'd like to do it too

I wish I could hate you
That way I could just forget you
Be a single girl and show the world
That I can live without you
Found myself in clutches
Of a panic since the break
I need closure
Want to hold you
Do you think we could just fake
Pretend the thaw never came
And act like nothing had changed

I knew it could never have worked from the outset
That doesn't make this heartache easier to accept

Spending every moment wondering
Can I call you yet
Though I know this must something
That we both will have to learn to accept

Now our love has melted
To a torrid overflow
And the ground’s all hard and barren
But I guess it's gonna take some time
To see something grow
Boy you'll be a long time ago

I knew it could never have worked from the outset
That doesn't make this heartache easier to accept
It's not like I want to leave you
Just I've got to go

And I'll always speak with fondness
For the year that we spent playing in the snow",Snow

Insatiable world
You'll never bleed on my colors for me

Throw me your waves
Let me drown my eyes in the tears that you've cried

I hold you in my arms
But you can't feel this warm embrace
You can't see the steady love from everyone
That's all around

And why should the shadows come?

I sing because I'm free
Oh, His eye is on the sparrow

And a piece of fertile ground

Man is made from dreams and bones
Feel the need to grow my own

Find my way in nature's chain
To my body and my brain
To the music from the land

Thicker than with pray'r and song

From his perch in yonder tree

Some hands will rob you
And some hands will beg
Some say they'll stay

I turn in my mind
What time already knows

In the time of the assassins they say ""Hallelujah""
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead

I sift through the ash
I look for a sign
I open the wound
That keeps me in line

The shoulder that turns
The flame that goes out
The chapter I close
There's no point to it now

In the time of the assassins they say ""Hallelujah""
It doesn't take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead

And can something changed
And still feel the same
The beginning's the end
I start all over again

Charlotte Gainsbourg,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear that--

I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world.

Mess around with your heart
And fill it to the brim with broken dreams

And if I pull this off
I'll refuse the Nobel prize
Instead I will look into your eyes

If I pull this off your whole body will be mine
And I'm prepared to work throughout the night

Our love goes under the knife
Nothing is taboo
? here on the cutting edge of science

I feel I'm getting lost
Absorbed into the fibre of your soul

Deep within the abattoir

Lost in you forever far from home

His name was Antonio

Took him out, and of his charms I had no doubt
Stayed drinking mojitos
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near
In my ear, he whispered and shed a tear
Oh my bambino
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart
Had been stolen by the two-faced low lothario

One night stand, lover you got out of hand
Oh yeah you went too far
Big mistake, falling for a first class fake
Who left me for my guitar
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near
Through my tears, I would have to find my dear
Guano Antonio
Tender in the bedroom is all I can remember
And the way he looked when he moved so near

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart
Had been stolen by the two-faced lothario

Oh my beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you
My beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you

Oh I know, oh I know, oh I know Antonio
Won't be back as I discovered on his track
He's gone back to Mexico, oh Antonio

Oh my beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you
My beautiful guitar
On and on I go till I find you

And in the morning when I woke there was no Antonio
Just some money that he'd left for the memory of me
And oh my beautiful guitar, that's what really broke my heart

With vassals and serfs at my side,

But I also dreamt which pleased me most
That you loved me still the same,
That you loved me
You loved me still the same,
That you loved me
You loved me still the same.

That knights upon bended knee
And with vows no maidens heart could withstand,
They pledged their faith to me.
And I dreamt that one of that noble host
Came forth my hand to claim.

Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me

Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide

But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it fine (so fine)

While life goes on around him everywhere

Goes without saying

Qu’est-ce que j’ai sur le nez ?
Un furoncle ! Un bouton !

J’mets la tête dans l’ congélateur

J’mets quoi ? Une jupe, un pantalon ?
Tout est trop petit, rien ne me va
A part une djellaba 
Il y a une tâche, mais quelle quiche !
Sur mon p’ tit haut fétiche 
Et cette moustache elle est à moi
Ou au sergent Garcia ?

Je sens qu’je vais gerber
Je laisse traîner deux, trois bouquins
Sur la table l’air de rien

Qu’est-ce que je fais ? Est-ce que j’change les draps ?

Elle a fait très grosse impression
Moi aussi avec d’la pratique
Je peux devenir anorexique 

Cette petite dinde s’est dandinée
Pour distribuer ses p’ tits baisers
Quand elle a demandé un café
J’ai vu tous mes potes se lever

Elle a passé l’après-midi
A moitié nue dans un transat
Pendant que mes meilleurs amis
Prouvaient qu’l’homme descend du primate

Cellule de crise entre copines
Organisée dans la cuisine
On a toutes conclu que c’est laid 
Que c’est laid une fille sans bourrelet

Faudrait jamais revoir ses ex
Ça vexe

Mais après tout j’étais l’ancienne
Il m’ fallait plus pour être battue
Qu’une vulgaire polytechnicienne
Top model à ses heures perdues

J’ai recommencé l’air de rien
A lui faire ma danse de l’indien
Celle-la même qui l’avait conduit
Y’a quelques mois sous mon tipi

Aussi r’montée qu’mon décolleté
Plus rien ne pouvait m’arrêter
J’allais lui mettre l’eau à la bouche 
Et mettre Barbie sur la touche

Dans la cuisine j’ai fait Gilda
En enlevant mes gants Mapa
Et j’allais me jeter sur lui
Quand il m’a dit… « Ah, au fait, j’ me marie »",Jamais Revoir Ses Ex
Charlotte Marin,"Fatiguée des baisers volés
Je trouvais le monde sans pitié
Et puis soudain l’été dernier
Voilà qu’un rendez-vous de juillet
A fait de moi sa belle de nuit
L’amour aux trousses on s’est enfui

Pendant neuf semaines et demi
Comme des enfants du paradis
On s’est aimé à bout portant
Sous le soleil de Satan
La fièvre au corps, au cœur, à l’âme
On s’est donné tout feu, tout flamme

Je me souviens d’ son ton flingueur
Et de sa scarface de menteur
Quand je l’ai pris la main au collet
D’une autre femme qu’il embrassait
Liaison fatale, liaisons dangereuses
Dernier tango pour les valseuses

C’est bon je connais la chanson
Tu n’auras pas mon grand pardon
Fallait pas jouer à l’éléphant 
Qui trompe toujours énormément
Tu as tenté l’aveu, les pleurs
Et je t’ai fait un goldfinger

Même si on dit qu’certains l’aiment chaud
La vengeance est un buffet froid
Tu peux me faire Fort Alamo
L’appartement il est à moi
Tu vas r’gretter ton jour de fête
Ta p’tite Cleo de cinq à sept

T’as gâché nos plus belles années
J’en ai des vertigos, j’en tremble
Même si nous nous sommes tant aimés
Nous ne vieillirons pas ensemble
Quand la grande illusion s’écroule
On a vraiment les Raging bull

Mon désir s’est brûlé les ailes
Tu m’dis et la tendresse bordel
Arrête ton charabia Ben Hur
La dolce vita va dans l’mur
Vraiment j’te dis Rio Bravo
Tu n’es qu’un gros porc-salino
Drapée dans mon mépris, j’te laisse
Tchao pantin, bonjour tristesse",Ma Vie en Vo
Charlotte Marin,"Je la sens venir
Elle va m’envahir
Plus rien ne peut la retenir

J’me prends la tête entre les mains
J’essaie d’appuyer sur des points
Je les masse pour me soulager
Mais j’sens l’étau se resserrer
Je me concentre sur la douleur
J’ai des nausées, j’ai mal au cœur 
Je tape contre le mur, le front en sueur
J’ai mal et j’ai peur

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

D’abord la souffrance est latente
Mais vite elle devient lancinante
A la dérive dans mon lit
Je cherche une porte de sortie
Un gant d’eau fraîche et des cachets
Mais rien ne paraît faire effet
Et moi la jeune fille en fleur
Je fane de douleur

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

C’est la personne non grata
Qui vient dès qu’on ne l’attend pas
Je suis étendue dans le noir
Un voile opaque sur le regard
J’ai le sentiment qu’un battant
Vient s’écraser sur mes tympans
Et à mesure qu’ils résonnent 
Moi je déraisonne

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

C’est comme un tremblement de tête
Qui grimpe sur l’échelle de Richter
Rien à faire pour que ça s’arrête
Avant le degré de l’enfer
J’peux entendre mon sang circuler
Son flux est comme précipité
Cette fois je crois qu’j’ai tout tenté
J’ai plus qu’à m’flinguer

Mauvaise graine
Elle pousse hors saison
Et pousse ma raison
A la haine
La migraine

C’est le silence qui me réveille
L’instinct de survie en éveil
Je sens mon esprit qui se fraye
Un chemin vers la vie
Elle est partie",La Migraine
Charlotte Marin,"Ecoute ce que j’ai à te dire
Ecoute jusqu’à la fin
Déjà ton attention chavire
Ton regard est lointain 
Tu sais où je veux en venir
Tu vas me donner tord
Mais ce silence doit finir
Avant qu’il nous dévore

Je n’ai pas les mots pour t’entendre
Et ce n’est pas mon rôle
Mon rôle à moi c’est d’être tendre
Mais quand l’amour te frôle
Tu me repousses et te replies
Te replies sur toi-même
Et comment partager ta vie
Sans pouvoir dire « je t’aime »

L’amour se fait dans un lit
Pas sur le divan d’un psy
Mais lorsque le passé le ronge
Il faut que l’amour s’allonge
Mais lorsque le passé le gêne
Il faut qu’ l’amour parle de haine 
Va voir quelqu’un
Et reviens
M’offrir demain

Je vois combien ces mots font mal
Dans ton regard glacial
Tu me dévisages comme si
Comme si j’avais trahi
Trahi la confiance entre nous
En te traitant de fou
Mais la folie c’est de s’enfuir
Pour semer ses souvenirs

Tu prends des poses, tu es nerveux
Quand on est en soirée
Tu dis qu’on serait mieux à deux
Mais dans l’intimité
Tu as sans cesse un air gêné
Même après des années
Et comment partager mon lit
Sans partager ma vie

L’amour se fait dans un lit
Pas sur le divan d’un psy
Mais lorsque le passé le ronge
Il faut que l’amour s’allonge
Mais lorsque le passé le gêne
Il faut qu’ l’amour parle de haine 
Va voir quelqu’un
Et reviens
M’offrir demain

Tu dis que tu n’as pas ni le temps
Ni l’envie, ni l’argent
D’aller confier ton passé
Devant un étranger
Tu dis qu’ tu n’en as pas besoin
Et que j’exagère
Mais comment partager demain
Sans partager hier

Tu dis que c’est tellement commode
Et tellement à la mode
De se regarder le nombril 
Tu crois que c’est facile
Pourtant rien n’est plus difficile
Que de se libérer 
Que d’accepter d’être fragile
Que d’accepter d’aimer

L’amour se fait dans un lit
Pas sur le divan d’un psy
Mais lorsque le passé le ronge
Il faut que l’amour s’allonge
Mais lorsque le passé le gêne
Il faut qu’ l’amour parle de haine 
Va voir quelqu’un
Et reviens

The whirlpool floating in my mind

Charlotte Martin,"It's 3 a.m. and I have been
In my head for quite some time
Every fear, every tear 
Has been swirling in my mind
And there are still a hundred reasons
I shouldn't walk away
Do I love you if I leave you?
You have no name

I was up all night
Waiting for some kind of miracle
I was up all night
Feeling alone in the universe
I was up all night

When morning comes
I will tell you (I will tell you)
It's life I have to chase
With every song that I sing
Will be written by your face

And if you're really meant to be
Then you'll be back again
And I watch as your beginning
Turns into the end

I was up all night (I was up all night)
Waiting for some kind of miracle
I was up all night (I was up all night)
Feeling alone in the universe
If it's you or if it's me I you save
I'm still throwing it all away
I was up all night

With a kick inside
In the dark you hide
And we both know how the end will be
In your little tide
With your eyes shut wide
And we both know how the end will be 
How it will be

I was up all night (I was up all night)
Waiting for some kind of miracle
I was up all night (I was up all night)
Feeling alone in the universe

Charlotte Martin,"Childhood living
Is easy to do
The things that you wanted
Well I bought them for you

Graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you
Just slide through my hands

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
And now you've decided
To show me the same

No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamt you
A sin and a lie
And I have my freedom
But I don't have much time

Fate has been suffered
And tears must be cried
So let's do some living
After we die

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away
No, couldn't drag me away

Charlotte Martin,"Inside my mouth I can hear all the voices say
Do not lean over the ledge
I shouldn't look down and I shouldn't have found
That your lips I still taste in my head
Raising my glass to the head of the class
As she powers out steps one through ten
I think I'll be fine if I'm covered in wine
Nice to hate you and love you again
And see you again
And see you again

Weary and worn little monster is born
Tell me lies and I'll justify them
Desperate today and it's making me pay
For that night for that kiss for your bed
Whoever dared to love someone out there
I don't need a balloon and a pin
The name of the game is outrunning the blame
So I hate you and love you we're friends
Guess we'll be friends
I guess we'll be friends

Oh why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me?

Better stop crying hello and goodbye-ing
Go on through me slip right through my hands
You get your time and the other half's mine
It's okay this love weighs fifty men
It's okay this love weighs fifty men
It's okay this love weighs fifty men

Oh why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me?
Why (why) can't (can't) you take me in your arms now?

So far from you; other side of the wall
There's a bottomless cry that is spinning
Interdimensional, hidden inside
Of these lights which I seem to be missing

Marching ahead to silent beats
Bumping into these dead machines
You can hear everything with me
You can win everyone but me

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

Don't think I'll talk
Yeah I don't think I'll breathe
And I don't think I'll think
What you're thinking

All that I know of us is what was there
In the longest of stares we were sinking
Ashes to beauty; rust in lust
Passion attempts; misguided trust
Smoking your bag of trickery
Getting to love the little beast

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
I don't

In this wading pool
In this waiting room
I elevate us down

In a neglected olive tree
Here is the part you reach for me
Say that you have no need of this
Say it again
Say it again
Say it again
Again again again

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you
And then you're gonna get down on your knees
And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing
Head up straight
I know what I'm doing

Gonna feel my way around you

And grow accustomed to the darkness
And see what you're supposed to see

I keep you down inside my heart
We watch the whole world fall apart
And melt into an ether sea

You failed to take me by the hand
I failed to make you understand
That all I wanted was your hands
On me

I'm captured in your eye
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And there's too many sad goodbyes
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And just a little higher now
Am I an inch away from heaven?
Am I an inch away from heaven?

The walls have ears
The stones have names
We gave in all our silly games
I knew I'd never let you go

And there is no one I can blame
Because your heart remained the same
I swear I'll never let you go

I'm captured in your eye
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And there's too many sad goodbyes
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And just a little higher now
'Cause every day I die for this
Am I an inch away from heaven?

Am I to be tortured
And not be the victim
All twisted up by my own pride
Am I to be stranded
Just waving my arms in the air
While you're trying to lie

I'm captured in your eye
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And there's too many sad goodbyes
Am I an inch away from heaven?
And just a little higher now
'Cause we're so close and far from this
Am I an inch away from heaven?

On a whim, on the wind, you were summoned to me
And the sails they were filled with a torrent of dreams
A kiss on the lips, you wake me from my sleep

So I watched the girls walking down the streets,

Many years ago, even then I knew
I've seen this picture before.

You are no stranger,

Que es dueño en parte 
De esta ciudad de locos. 
Hace que baila con la banda en la ruta 
Pero en verdad les roba el oro 
Y les da unas prostitutas. 
Estás limpiando las cenizas 
De nuestro breve carnaval 
Ya estamos en camino a otra ciudad. 
Ya ves no somos ni turistas 
Ni artistas de sonrisa y frac 
Formamos parte de tu realidad

Hay algo en tu nariz, que escondes muy bien te encentro feliz, triste.

Que era amante de los jueves
Un gran señor que sufría el deshonor
De sus sirvientas infieles

Y una mujer neurótica sirviendo el té

Disponible el primer jueves del mes

Había una vez, una casa con tres
Personas en una mesa
Uno en inglés, otro hablaba en francés
Y el otro hablaba en caliente

Cada uno mantenía su conversación
Que giraba en tres temas en cuestión
Amor libre, propiedad y represión

Y en la casa la noche pasa amablemente

""no tienes profesión""

Es muy duro poder mejorar

Y me pesa el hambre de esperar

Quién me dará algo para fumar

If not for real, then in my mind
'Cause darlin', our love all but died
Long ago, long ago
But each time I've crossed that door
My heart says, One chance, give it one chance more
Love might find us like before
But Lord, don't I know that ain't so

Still I stay, still I hope
Someday we'll find the love we lost on down that road
And that somehow these dyin' hearts can be saved
Just might be saved
Still I stay with these dreams
And pray that it's not as bad as it seems
But it is, it's just that way; still I stay

It might appear that I'm a fool
Just for stayin' here with you
And sometimes I swear it's true
What can I say? Nothin' to say

Sure you'd think I'd finally learned
But not today, not today

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Will You Love Me Tomorrow/Maybe Baby/Tallahassie Lassie/Dream Lover

You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name
Take me to your domain
Trick, you must be out yo' brain
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine
And you could have some if you get me on your plane

Cold truth for ya yellow belly, 'cause you scared
Butterflies flapping in your eyes, that's you dead
Now you living in a killer's mind
No loose ends that's nuisance
No body no crime from the start line
The greatest Al Capone of our time
You keep running and I'll show up where you might hide
Decide now if wanna be a knight rider
Or lights out rapture that ass like a mobster
Tight crowd full of veterans who played contra
And I doubt that'll ever tell you that you harder
Mind out cowboy wanna lose ya partner this my house gangsta

Head gone feeling like King Kong giving Jessica Lange back
I'm feeling all that Kenan way before the claps
If Kel was here he'd hand me the orange soda cap, why?
Can't lie yo I'm live as the vinyl spinning double time 
Around the vibe so you might lose ya mind yo
Look around like where'd the time go?
Guess our father brought an onslaught 
Of another aura to make ya mind go staccato
Strings of heart compose straight classics for kings of art
So if you're thinking that you're that sick I think you're not
I'm Mr. Rooney kicking hatricks

Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back, take it on back

Yeah!
Well I wonder if she ever wonders
If I'm thinkin' 'bout her too
'Cause I'm thinkin' I still love her
If she only knew all I wanna do

Is take it on back, take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener

Take it on back to the truck bed blanket
Holdin' that girl 'til the sun come up
Take it on back to our song and crank it
Turn it up loud I can see her now

Take it on back, take it on back
Back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back, take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it

Her voice is like a summer breeze
When it's ninety-eight degrees outside,
It's refreshing.

Somehow I'll find a way.
She's so far away from me,

Chase Coy,"One more year and I'll be heading out on my own
Leaving friends and the place that I call home,
I don't wanna go
I just need to know that I can come back
I need to know, I only need to know that
You'll be here when I come back home
Cause I don't wanna miss
A single autumn evening here with you like this
I don't wanna miss

All those nights we danced by the moonlight
Conversations about nothing til midnight
You and I huddled close til the daylight came
Remember the colors reflected in your eyes,
The scene painted golden
As the sun rises over you and me, darling

One more year, we'd better make the best of this one
You just can't beat the weather here in autumn
Please stay close to me
I just need to know you're gonna call me
I need to know that everything will all be okay
While I'm away

A single autumn evening here with you like this
I don't wanna miss

Chase Coy,"We met more than two years back
It's frightening how time can go by so fast
That you don't even notice when it's gone
There's something about Ohio that I can't help but love
But sometimes the highway miles seem so long

So don't cry, darling, I'll be there in the morning
But you know, that the worse part is always heading home

We spent so much time apart
I know, sometimes it's hard
But girl, but if there's one thing I'm sure of, it is us
Besides, we have the small things
Like eight-dollar engagement rings
To keep us sane 'till you get on that bus

So don't cry, darling, you'll be in the morning
But you know, that the worse part is always heading home

One day we'll start our new life behind the glow of the pale city lights
In an apartment of our own
It will be so perfect and we'll both know that it was worth the wait
I can hardly wait for that day to come

Chase Coy,"Summer arrived on the back of a mockingbird
It sang a sweet melody, but couldn't seem to find the right words
I don't know if you've heard
But it's all over town, yeah they're buzzing about it now

I was singing along when the mockingbird came to me
Perched on my windowsill and hummed along quietly
But before long she was singing along and she said, yeah she said

""I've been waiting so long for these words to come out
It's practically all I've been thinking about 
So thank you for finding the words I couldn't find on my own
Now I'm not alone""

Autumn was on its way, summer was on its way out
The mockingbird told me, ""I change with the seasons""
And so she was leaving town, in a few days now

We said our goodbyes but I secretly wished for more time
The seasons are merciless
Then for a while we both stood in silence until, she said:

""I've been waiting so long for these words to come out
It's practically all I've been thinking about
So thank you for finding the words I couldn't find on my own
Now I'm not alone""",Mockingbird

Just know I need you here
I need you near me now
You were brighter than the pale white moon
Reflected in your eyes
So I guess it's no surprise
I can't forget you
No matter what I do

I will always carry you in my heart
You'll always be my shooting star
Autumn days will fade away
But memories will always stay the same
I'm hoping you will never change
Don't ever change

I just need to slow down for a while
I'm missing your warm smile
And the way you used to say
""stay with me till the daylight breaks
No matter what it takes
Just say you'll stay""

To these golden rays of sunshine.

I believe
That if you leave
I'll be just fine
Yeah, I'll be fine

But for now I'm stuck here waiting for
The sun to come and stop this awful downpour.

And the clouds will clear
And I will hear the sound of singing birds outside my window

With all it's golden rays

And this is the last summer we'll have 
All to ourselves
Before next year when we have to pack and move on out
No matter what happens 
I'll miss the friends I've made in this town

And I wish
That time would just slow down

Chase Coy,"A warm afternoon in the middle of June,
And you didn't know that I'd fallen for you.
The long nights we stayed up, excuses we made up,
And I didn't know that you felt this way too.
There's nothing as sweet as your voice is to me.
It's better than summer and spring.
The words that you speak bring such
Comfort to me when we're miles apart and I'm lonely.

And as I recall, it was
Presidents' Hall where I found you, a year had gone past.
The long days without you spent thinking about you,
And all of the memories they came flooding back.
There's nothing as sweet as your voice is to me.
It's better than summer and spring.
The words that you speak bring such comfort to me
When we're miles apart and I'm lonely.
And darling I won't ever let you go,
So I just thought that I'd let you know.

I must have done something right along the way.

The chill in the air in November?
The autumn breeze wrapped us in blankets 
And we held our breath and closed our eyes.

Do you recall that
We thought it would all last forever?
The days of our youth and the weather
And the love that we wore on our chests.
But all good things must end.
And do you remember
Watching the sun set together?
The rays of the sun lit up every last one of the memories we held in our fists.

Do you recall that
We always swore that we would never
Forget all those days and weather that led us to display our love on our chests.
But all good things must end.

And there’s a new owner, Joe what’s his face
Last December, he bought this place
His girlfriend Jessie, she sure is sexy
But she can sure be a bitch
And I don’t know why but I still buy drinks for two
Make ‘er scrate for me, men would lie for her
But that don’t put her back in this barstool

And the beer’s still warm
All year ‘round can’t catch a buzz from the suds
And the tears they’re pourin’ down on me
Send me out to sea and take me to a place where the whiskey’s a little more sour
I guess happy hour ain’t so happy without her

That same damn skin her cover band
Playin’ sweet home Alabama
For the third time tonight (they still playin’ it too slow)
We used to dance all night long
She swore it was her favorite song
But now I guess, Joe’s girl Jess is the star of the floor
And the tourists backed this place out
Ride around since
I still be drinkin’ at this bar
And I’ll be gone by then

And the beer’s still warm

Don’t you worry ‘bout me, though I am callin’ a cab and I ain’t never comin’ back
I know I said that last night
I said that a thousand times

But the beer’s still warm
All year ‘round can’t catch a buzz from the suds
And the tears they’re pourin’ down on me
Send me out to sea and take me to a place where the whiskey’s a little more sour
I guess happy hour ain’t so happy without her

I ain’t seen you around
In a long long time
Why’s that, I can’t really recall
No reason to rhyme
Oh wait, yes I can
She never called me back
She must’ve gone find you another man to fall for your act
No you’re so friendly
When you see me
Sittin’ up here at this bar
A keg deep in drinks
And you really wanna know if you can join me
Hell no!

No, you can’t sit here
No, I’m drinkin’ this beer
‘Cause you and all you done to me
Now you seem so sad, you say you missed me bad
You think it’s all good, but girl, I disagree
Now you wanna share a glass ‘cause you must be high on grass
You can kiss my ass

Maybe a little harsh
Yes, I’ll admit it
I took that one a little bit too far
But I couldn’t resist
I’m caught in your act
Hung on your bullshit
Now you wanna know if I’ll be your friend
Oh girl, not one bit
What’s that I see?
Could that be a tear?
Rollin’ down your cheek
Alright baby, come on over here
And you can join me for just one drink
Oh wait, never mind

No, you can’t sit here
No, I’m drinkin’ this beer
‘Cause you and all you done to me
Now you seem so sad, you say you missed me bad

A quick silver tan line, riding shot gun in my truck
A charm with a peace sign around her neck for a little luck

I got a Bible in my dresser, just in case somebody cares
I've been here forever, 1959
My name is on the front door, they call me 205
And man you can't imagine, the things that happen here
I've seen my share of laughing and I've seen a lot of tears
Drug deals and last meals and love that seemed so real
Until I saw the flash of those hundred dollar bills
But let me tell you something crazy, that I'd never seen before
Starts with Johnny and Katie, first time they walked through my door

It was a Friday night, late fall
After a high school football game
They snuck away, in a beat up Chevrolet
Yeah they made love for the first time,
Till that Carolina sun came up
That's where it all began
At the Conway Motor Inn

Well they lit a cigarette, and talked about their lives
Said they were getting married, after graduation night
It all seemed so perfect, but they didn't have a clue
That one be one of them would be right back here with someone new
Now fast forward four years, and that white picket fence
It ain't holding out what it should be keeping in
See, I see Katie on the weekends, when Johnny's working nights
And the man she's coming here with, ain't the man I recognize

It was a Friday night, late fall
After a high school football game
They snuck away, in her lover's Escalade
Yeah they made love for the first time,
Till Johnny's graveyard shift was up
Both livin' in sin
At the Conway Motor Inn

Tonight Johnny ain't working, cause he's right here with me
With a pistol in his right hand, just waitin' on the key
To turn in my door, and when they both walk in
He lays that hammer down, and that's where this story ends

Cotton candy, salty kisses, and a couple stolen beers
Your tan lines were the map for my hands to find their way
And that empty lifeguard shack, we watched our innocence fade

Caught in that beach blonde salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soaking the summer in, Coppertone glistening
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One, two, three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out
In beach town

Sneaking in and getting kicked out at the bayside pool
And watching your tee shirt drip dry
Middle of the night, that was so damn cool
And sandals in your hands
Swaying to the beat of an off beat cover band
Spilling your drink, making me sink
Deeper and deeper with every half drunk wink

In that beach box salt sand tide
Ferris wheel make our ride
Soaking the summer in, Coppertone glistening
Tracing the tattoos on your skin
One, two, three months fly
Like a blink in your blue eyes
Where young love rolls in fast as it rolls out

Florida State came calling
Your goodbye tears came falling
I said I don't want to go if you don't want to go

A hazelnut buzz, a house band beat
It was a summer heat dragging me to a fifth year fall

With my high school love, short hair
And that sweet hometown southern drawl

For a stranger in my bed and a night that needs explaining
I've opened more bottles than I've ever have my Bible
This third row communion sure won't lead me to revival

Between the Black Label and the letters unread
I've felt what living is, and what it's like to live dead

I've taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I've been so high thought I wasn't coming back
And just when I think I'm too far gone
Ringing in my head's the twenty-third psalm
I've seen the light, I've seen the darkness
Only God knows where my heart is
I've got my strength and Lord knows I've got my weakness
Oh, I'm lost somewhere between Jack Daniels and Jesus

It's my fault that I ain't called my mamma in a month of Sundays
She'd smell the whiskey through that phone
I can't stand to hear her heartbreak
Next week I see my brother Casey for the first time
Since it all went down and I blacked his eye the night after our daddy died

I've taken a ride in the devil's Cadillac
I've been so high thought I wasn't coming back

And you can't change where you've been
But today, I have the opportunity to choose

Here I am now looking at thirty, and I got so much to say
Gotta get this off of my chest, I gotta let it go today
I was always too concerned about what everybody would think
But I can't live for everybody; I gotta live my life for me, yeah

I've reached a fork in the road of my life where
Ain't nothing gonna happen unless I decide

(I choose) to be authentic in everything (I do)
My past don't dictate who (I am)

I don' been through some painful things I thought that I would never make it through
Filled up with shame from the top of my head to the soles of my shoes
I've put myself in so many chaotic circumstances
By the grace of God I've been given so many second chances

But today I decided to let it all go
I'm dropping these bags, I'm making room for my joy

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Because you never know where life is gonna take you
And you can't change where you've been
But today, I have the opportunity to choose
(Hey)
Release the guilt about why things happen the way they did
'Cause life is gonna do what it do
And everyday I have the opportunity to choose

From this day forward, I'm going to be exactly who I am
I don't need to change the way that I live just to get a man, no
I even had a talk with my mama and I told her today I'm grown
From this day forward, every decision that I make will be my own

(And I choose) to be the best that I can be
(I choose) to be courageous in everything (I do)

Not a single word is moving,

I'm looking for an open door when it's over.
You know it's over.
I've gotta find a sign or a way to pull myself together
Before I walk up there tonight 
Or I'll be sitting up so late with my face in

And the soft angel.
Voices singing to the sound of hundreds and thousands of lives.
All muted by a wave of the oceans fury.
Pack your bags.
Here we come.
Pack your bags here it comes.
To come and take you away.
There's an angel begging you to come to her.
I know the ocean took you by surprise but I don't worry.
Child it will be alright.
There's a message to the king.
It reads of disappointing numbers of the children who have come home to kiss his ring.

Chasing Victory,"I've been thinking about something in our past.
Words you said that were forgot.
I don't want to be a dime or a dozen child.
A mother's love should not be lost, instead of storming out the door.
You could turn around and look me in the eyes.
I'm one of the three from two.
Who never loved each other; so I know it's hard.
But could you try.
Show me a mother's tender heart spilled out for her children.
Call me your own to let me know you never thought less of me.
I don't feel betrayed.
I was just so scared of losing you.
All the times you tried to hurt yourself, you only hurt me.

But when cities fall they 
Build them back much taller than they were 
Is this love contagious 
Well if you really want to know 
I never felt the way you did so oh let this go 
There's a difference to our opinions 
And a chemical imbalance

Sitôt les paupières closes les remords apparaissent, elle invente des histoires, le chat mord la princesse.
Elle chantonne tout bas,
Alice aimerait écrire mais les mots ne viennent pas...

...à pas elle se construit une maison de poupée.
Elle a verrouillé la porte et avalé la clé.
Elle récite des poésies, les romans ça l'ennuie,
surtout si les histoires reflètent un peu sa vie

Alice ne peut pas dormir, trop d'images à l'esprit.
Alors elle danse, elle rigole elle chante et joue aussi.
Elle danse mais seule sur son lit, elle a mal à la tête,
Ce sont toutes ces histoires qui se cognent, elle s'entête

Alice ne veut pas 
D'une vie grise et rêve,
Mais ses rêves l'enferment
Et quand elle rêve elle ne vit pas.

Alice a peur du temps
Qui file entre ses doigts,
Mais peu importe le coût
Jusqu'au bout Alice s'accrochera

Alice ne peut pas dormir, elle invente des histoires qu'elle murmure en secret pendant toute la nuit.
Alice, parfois  voudrait ne pas vieillir, souhaite que le temps l'oublie.
Elle attend, devant la glace,
De voir couler des larmes qui ne viennent pas...

...à pas elle choisit de punir de plus en plus fort un corps qui matérialise tous ses démons.
Elle cherche, en vain dans un monde chimérique des amis de chiffon.
Elle s'énerve, n'écoute rien, mais persiste,
car...

Alice ne veut pas 
D'une vie bien tranquille,
Elle aspire à plus d'ivresse,
Dans cette quête d'ivresse elle se noie.

Alice a peur du vide
Qui s'installe dans sa vie.
Les normes les règles l'exaspèrent,
la vie au quotidien l'ennuie.

Alice boit le ciel, un bleu qui vire au gris, elle essore les nuage, s’enivre de la pluie.
Elle tombe à pic, à cœur ouvert elle goutte le monde du bout des doigts.
Elle effleure mais ne touche pas,
C’est la transe elle implose, ses désirs la foudroient

Pero no falta quien mande un zapatazo 
Que salga hecho balazo a quitarle lo chillón 
Y en el alero del místico tejado 
El gato se ha quejado cantando esta canción 

Gato: para curar mi mal de amores 
Dijeron los doitores que no había salvación 
Ora me dicen gato viudo 
Porque una gata pudo quitarme lo chiquión 

Antes sacaba del mandado 
Me daba pa´ mi helado, mi cine y mi jurbol 
Ora con lo que me ha pasado 
Me tiene más enfriado que un hielo de jaibol 

Con esta triste y maullida serenata

Salió una vieja con cuetes, crema y bata 
Y le pidió a la gata tuviera compasión

La frialdad que tuviste al decirme adiós
Fuiste tiempo de amor por las noches

Era llegar con la espada hasta la pared
Fuiste tantas cosas a la vez

Que me cuesta creer que hoy no seas nada
Sobre todo porque no es verdad
No consigo olvidar
Esa mirada que aun me haré estremecer
Fuiste amiga de mis enemigos
Todos ellos antiguos amigos
Ya sé que no se puede evitar lo de ser mujer

Fuiste mucho y fuiste muy poco
Así­ son las historias de locos
Son cortas y anchas con forma de corazón
Fuiste tantas cosas a la vez

Chayanne,"Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar
Con el tumbao que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Paque no sepan en el cual de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sobrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas pasi hay problemas salir volao
Lentes oscuros paque no sepan que está mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando ríe se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes patrabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero tosaben que es policía
Pedro navaja y el diente de oro vuelva a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del saguán
Y pedro navaja aprieta un puño dentro del gabán

Mira paun lado mira pael otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con que comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revólver esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera paque no estorbe
Un treinta y ocho smith and wesson del especial
Que carga encima paque la libre de todo mal

Y pedro navaja puñal en mano le fue paencima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando to a la avenida 'guiso fácil'
Mientras reía el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como una cañón

Y pedro navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revólver en mano y de muerte herida a él le decía
Yo que pensaba hoy no es mi día, estoy salá
Pero pedro navaja tu estás peor no estás en ná

Y créanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadie salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos muertos se tropezó
Cogió el revólver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó

Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao
El coro que aquí les traje y da el mensaje mi canción
La vida te da sorpresas, sorpresas te da la vida ¡ay dios
Pedro navaja ladrón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata a hierro termina

La vida te da
Maleante pescador pael anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina un tiburón enganchaste
I like to live in America

La vida te da
Ocho millones de historias tiene
La ciudad de Nueva York

La vida te da
Como decia mi abuelita el que dé último rie se rie mejor
I like to live in America

La vida te da
Cuando lo manda el destino no lo cambia ni el mas bravo
Si naciste pamartillo del cielo te caen los clavos

La vida te da
En barrio de guapo cuidado en la acera
Cuidao cámara que el que no corre vuela

La vida te da
Como en una novela de kafka
El borracho dobló por el callejón

Chayanne,"Cuando la pena cae sobre mí
El mundo deja ya de existir,
Miro hacia atrás y busco
Entre mis recuerdos
Para encontrar la niña que fui
Y algo de todo lo que perdí
Miro hacia atrás y busco
Entre mis recuerdos

Sueño con noches brillantes al borde
De un mar de aguas claras y puras
Y un aire cubierto de azahar

Cada momento era especial
Días sin prisas, tardes de paz,
Miro hacia atrás y busco
Entre mis recuerdos

Yo quisiera volver a encontrar la pureza
Nostalgia de tanta inocencia
Que tan poco tiempo duró

Con el veneno sobre mi piel
Frente a las sombras de la pared
Miro hacia atrás y busco
Entre mis recuerdos,
Vuelvo hacia atrás y busco
Entre mis recuerdos

Y si las lágrimas vuelven
Ellas me harán más fuerte",Entre Mis Recuerdos

No se porque todo me sabe a ti 
una palabra, un verso, una canciÃ³n 
es un misterio de mi corazÃ³n  
que no me quiere ni contar a mi. 
Vivo contigo, 
es el sueÃ±o que yo tengo siempre 
vivo contigo,

",Te Necesito (Aprender a Amar)
Chayanne,"En palabras simples y comunes yo te extraño
En lenguaje terrenal mi vida eres tu 
En total simplicidad seria yo te amo 
Y en un trozo de poesia tu seras mi luz, mi bien
El espacio donde me alimento de tu piel que es bondad
La fuerza que me mueve dentro para recomenzar 
Y en tu cuerpo encontrar la paz

Si la vida me permite a lado tuyo
Creceran mis ilusiones no lo dudo
Si la vida la perdiera en un instante
Que me llene de ti para amar después de amarte, vida

No tengas miedos ni dudas
Este amor es demasiado bueno
Que tu seras mi mujer
Yo te pertenezco todo entero
Mira mi pecho, lo dejo abierto
Para que vivas en el

Para tu tranquilidad me tienes en tus manos
Para mi debilidad la única eres tu
Al final tan solo se que siempre te he esperado
Y que llegas a mi vida 
Y tu me das la luz del bien
Ese mundo donde tus palabras hacen su voluntad
La magia de este sentimiento que es tan fuerte y total 
Y tus ojos que son mi paz

Si la vida me permite a lado tuyo
Crecerán mis ilusiones no lo dudo
Si la vida la perdiera en un instante
Que me llene de ti para amar después de amarte, vida 

No tengas miedos ni dudas
Este amor es demasiado bueno
Que tu seras mi mujer
Yo te pertenezco todo entero

Chayanne,"I went to party
The people were screaming
Oh yeah!

Everybody laughing
I couldn't believe, I was so surprised

Simon Says, before we lose our minds
Simon Says, it's only just a game
Simon Says, let's do it all again. 
I didn't understand

I was so confused
Who was this Simon?
Who let him loose?
The party was rocking, so out of control

No way to stop it
No where to go
Simon Says, let's play it one more time? 
No, no, we won't go

We want to play
No, no we won't go
Until we play
Oh, oh, oh we want to play 

If you want to play
The rules you must obey

Simon Says like you just don't care

Simon Says let the girls sing YE-AH! YE-AH!
Simon Says let the boys sing YO-YO!

Shake your body all about. You're out!

Chayanne,"Serás la noche oscura donde arderé 
Las vigas de esta casa que aún sigue en pie 
Me beberé tu sangre y pondré tu piel 
Escribiré tu nombre en cada pared 
No fue cosa de un dí­a ni dos ni tres 
Como un tigre a su presa te acorralé 

Porque hueles a hierba, porque sabes a selva 
Porque alguien rompió el molde 
No hay nada igual 
Porque hueles a tierra, porque sabes a hembra 
Cuando nadie nos vea 
Sube al desván

Quien duerme a tu costado pierde la fe 
De que otra vida exista que pueda ser 
Mejor que recorrerte al amanecer

Siempre inventamos fuerza para crecer",Sube Al Desvan

Chayanne,"De lunes a domingo
Voy desesperado
El corazón prendido
Allí en el calendario
Buscándote y buscando

Tú dime donde estás
Que yo no te he encontrado

Yo voy al contrario
Bebiéndome la vida
A sorbos y a tragos
Me viste así de frente
Que tremendo impacto
Para unirme a tu mirada
Dime si hay que ser

Torero
Poner el alma en el ruedo
No importa lo que se venga
Pa' que sepas que te quiero
Como un buen torero
Me juego la vida por tí
Te dicen que ya me vieron
Solitario en un callejón
Que ya no duermo y desvarío

Que el humor ya me cambió
Y tú por dónde estás
Que mi presión ya no me da
Te buscaré, vuelve conmigo
Porque tu no sabes
Que yo te necesito
Como el perro al amo
Que si tu no respondes

Aquí todo es caos
Me viste así de frente
Que tremendo impacto
Para unir me a tu mirada
Dime si hay que ser

Chayanne,"Why Pedro llega tarde una vez más why ella despierta
Se hare que duerme why el le habla igual
Algo que inventó en el bar, why ella sabe de historias
Si tuviera un peso por cada desilusión

why cuantas mañanas puedes enfrentar
Cuantas promesas puedes ignorar
Antes de cortar esas cadenas
Que hay en tu corazón

Días, Pero esta noche Pedro encontrará su cama vacía
Why en un trense encuentra una mujer, why cuantas mañanas
Puedes enfrentar, cuantas promesas puedes ignorar
Allá en otro lugar que hay en tu corazón

Cuantas mañanas puedes despertar why nada que olvidar
Cuantas promesas te puedes regalar
Allá en otro lugar, lo que es el corazón
Why Pedro llega tarde una vez más

Chayanne,"Cada domingo yo te veo
Por la avenida de morfeo
No sé si pasas por pasar
O te encaminas a buscar

Las fantasías de tus sueños
Hay otras que desde la acera
Me ofrecen más que sus caderas
Pero no hay otra como tú

Ninguna tiene la virtud
De hipnotizar a las estrellas
Y hoy que por fin te acercas
Te confieso mi amor

Que nunca vi algo mejor
Eres toda ideal
Y no hay na' ni nadie como tú
A veces choca tu mirada

Con el suspiro que se escapa
Del fondo de mi corazón
Donde se pierde la razón
Cuando me dices sin palabras

Que tú también me esperabas
Te declaro mi amor
Dime que sí por favor
Eres toda ideal

Y no hay na'ni nadie como tú
Necesito saber que vas a ser mi mujer
Mi principio y final
Y no hay más ni nadie como tú

Te confieso mi amor
Que nunca vi algo mejor
Eres toda ideal
Y no hay na'ni nadie como tú

Te declaro mi amor
Dime que sí por favor
Eres algo tan especial
Y no hay más ni nadie como tú

Vas a ser mi mujer

Me desata la locura
Sube why baja por mi espalda

Es la sombra de mis dudas
Agua dulce en el desierto
El final de cada cuento

Es el amor que sube despacito por mi corazon
Why va dejando en cada rincon
Why viene why va, why en el vaiven
Ahora te quiero why ahora no se

Es el amor que sabe que esos ojos son mi perdición
Que me dice que si, aunque yo diga no
Why viene why va, why en el vaiven
Por cada beso me roba tres

Se me escapa de los dedos
Es el dueño de los celos
Why su nombre esta grabado
En la palma de mi mano

Es corriente que me arrastra
Es el sueño que me falta
Es mi noche de verano
Pedacitos de pecado

Es el amor que sube despacito por mi corazon
Why va dejando en cada rincon
Why viene why va, why en el vaiven

Y han conocido el amor por esa tierna

Algunos dicen que era rica y emperatriz
Lo que bien claro es que nos trae puestos de nariz

Que todos te queremos ver
Bailando hasta el amanecer

Bailando hasta el amanecer

Todos quieren jugar con su boquita
Y todos quieren soñar que sea su muñequita
Ella se llama traición ella es la diva
De lo que ella toco ya nadie se lo quita

Le envían rosas y regalos a su camarín
Muchos famosos se anunciaban en su boletín
Debemos aires desde América hasta Madrid
La princesita juguetea con su mundo

Que todos te queremos ver
Bailando hasta el amanecer
Baila bailarina, baila

Que me calma y que me enciende

Supe que no había que ser un adivino
Para comprender que el resto de mi vida
Era indispensable vivirla contigo
La primera vez que acaricié tu cuerpo

Pude comprobar que existe el paraíso
No hace falta dar la vuelta al universo
Sólo basta con haberte conocido
Tengo titulado el sentimiento

Con tu nombre y apellido

Es tuyo y ya no es mío

Vivo en la oscuridad y las horas
Matan en esta cruel soledad

Lo siento, me puede el sentimiento
No sé cómo enfrentarlo
No sé donde llegar, te juro que me siento

Si yo me la paso pensando en ti
Contando días para que estés aquí
Matando esta sed calmando las ansias tuyas
Cuando te imaginaste que te amaban tanto

Un ser humano que no fuera un santo
Siguiendo mi fe, colgado de tu locura
Y las horas pasan, pierdo la identidad
Y las horas matan, me es difícil respirar

Con mis sentidos más errados
Asimilando cada vez la situación, de que no estas
Cuando yo vuelvo a casa mal, ya nada me hace gracia
Que estoy desorientado, desesperado

Es que si tú no vuelves, yo seguiré
Muriendo cada día un poco, que vivo ausente
Y amanecer sin ti es cosa de locos
Es que sin ti las horas tienen color a oscuridad y a pleno duelo
Han cambiado las cosas, estoy solo y tengo miedo

Por los rincones corren tus palabras
Aun aquí puedo escucharlas y cada silaba
Me rompe el corazón, porque quizás yo guardo
La esperanza igual que un día regresaras
Que estoy hecho pedazos, desesperado

Es que si tú no vuelves, yo seguiré
Muriendo cada día un poco, que vivo ausente
Y amanecer sin ti es cosa de locos
Es que sin ti las horas tienen color a oscuridad y a pleno duelo
Han cambiado las cosas, estoy solo y tengo miedo

Y aunque parezca una exageración
Me siento como en un destierro
Estando en una olla de presión
De depresión y sentimiento

Yo me estoy ahogando
Me estoy muriendo y ya no aguanto
Por los rincones corren tus palabras
Aun aquí puedo escucharlas
Y cada silaba me rompe el corazón

Es que si tú no vuelves, yo seguiré

Por siempre

Yo estaba en una vida sin color ahora nada importa si hace
Frio o hace calor ya nada mas, dame la paz
Ahora traigo ritmo y emocion, armemos y cantemos una gran
Celebración y siempre habrá y siempre habrá

Yo quiero mas besos en la boca, quiero mas
Yo quiero mas besos en la boca y ser feliz completamente

Chayanne,"La noche es buena para nosotros 
Constelaciones de nuestro lado 
Los universos en paralelo 
Y los planetas van conspirando 
Mientras tu boca junto a la mía 
Van convocando un pacto sagrado 
Que se convergen en nuestros cuerpos 

Y tu y yo nos amamos 
En tu boca sensual 
Yo me pierdo mujer 
Cuando empiezo a soñar 
Cuando empiezo a caer 
Eres tu celestial y divina mujer 
Y me quiero quedar 

Bailando apretados, bailando pegados, 
Bailando dos corazones, en esta canción de amor 

Y yo me iré contigo, donde quiera que sea 
Donde me lleve el barco, la corriente, la marea 
Donde haya que quedarse, por tu risa, por tu espera 
Yo me iré contigo donde quiera que sea

En tu boca sensual 
Yo me pierdo mujer 
Cuando empiezo a soñar 
Cuando empiezo a caer 
Eres tu celestial y divina mujer 
Y me quiero quedar 

Bailando apretados, bailando pegados
Bailando dos corazones, en esta canción de amor 

En el presente, desde el pasado
Nos conocimos y nos aliamos 
Desde otras vidas, desde los sueños
Desde la alianza de nuestros santos
Desde que fuiste, desde que eras
Eres la chispa y eres el rayo 
Bebo la fuente de la alegría
Y tu y yo nos amamos

Bailando dos corazones, en esta canción de amor",Bailando Dos Corazones

De todos los besos que dan, el tuyo no lo olvido 
De tantas miradas me quedo en tus ojos perdidos 
Tu risa es la canción más linda que adora mi oído 

Cuanto me pelee con mi soledad 
Cuanto yo soñé con verte llegar 
Poder abrazarte así, todo hace sentido 
Saber que eras para mi

Chayito Pinedo,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17 (Cancion)

Me and my friends at the table doing shots

Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Although my heart is falling too

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Chazz Cats,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

In the beginin' I was fine when you
Introduced me to to an old high school friend
I was was questionin' 
If she
Was schemin'

All of a sudden she was at home with us
Always sittin' right next to you
Yea I see her plan
But you don't

Don't you say no, no
She would have to make it through
Say yes

(Chorus)
She ain't your friend
She's just a man taker, yea
She ain't no friend
She's just a man taker, yea

Kepp up with all your explainations
Sayin' she your friend, that's your imagination
Why don't you just gimmie your phone
So that I can ask her on my own

Tried to contender, boy just surrender
Everywhere she ask to go 
You want to send her
You do things at the click of her finger, baby

If you say no, no
She would have to make it through
Say yes

She ain't your friend
She's just a man taker, yea
She ain't no friend
She's just a man taker, yea

I said nothin'
Kept it silent
Knowing the truth
'Til I saw her try to put a move onto you baby
What's she doin'
I'll tell you she a man taker

I told you that she is
I told you what she was
I'll tell you what she is

Che'Nelle,"We were friends, we were cool
Used to talk on the phone to the early in the morning
You were there, you were down
Under all circumstances you were around
But than we kissed
Didn't think it was a major risk
And now it's changed all up into this
And I really miss what we had
And I wanna get us back

You never took it personal before I was your girl
Lets get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Lets get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back where we belong
Lets get right back where we belong
Lets get right back where we belong

Smothering me on the time 
When I move to the left you're still hanging on my right
Checkin out frequently and 
I'll never be ok if you keep pushing me
And you never had it in you to but how you acted
Now it's like I'm not so sure
And I really miss what we had
So can we go back to when 

You never took it personal before I was your girl
Lets get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Lets get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back to where we belong
Lets get right back where we belong
Lets get right back where we belong

You were my rock you were my mate
Right up in my face when I was losing faith
You wouldn't get mad when I would say no
You let me be free but now you wanna control
Baybe it's sad I believe
I was for you and you was for me
I'm at the point the point of no returning
I am overthinking something you love
Lets get right back where we belong
Cuz...

You never took it personal before I was your girl
Lets get right back where we belong
I used to tell you everything now I can't say anything
Lets get right back where we belong
And all of the nights you gave me advice
They've all been replaced by the usual fights
And now I don't know what to do to get us back
Right back to where we belong
Lets get right back where we belong
Can we go back
Lets get right back where we belong
Can we go back 
Lets get right back where we belong
Can we go back
Lets get right back where we belong
You never took it personal
Until I was your girl
I used to tell you everything
And now I cannot say anyhting...

Needing a piece of self discovery so I can
Patch myself up and make a quick recovery

Cause it just soon helium balloon bursting

Come break, my chains come help me (Tights is the gag in my mouth)
Come break, my chains come help me (Tights is the gag in my mouth)

Come break my chains come help me out (picking up the reigns in the south),

Cheap Sex,"The newspapers they never give me the truth
No one ever listens to today's youth
All our heroes are lying in their graves
And we are all rats trapped in a maze.
The youth is just a pawn and the leaders are king
You can try to speak out, but nobody wins

[Chorus]
These are the sounds of desperation
Hear the screams of our generation
So hear our voice, and hear our cry
Give us the truth - and not your lies!

The media has a bias based on their views
Making it so hard to get any real news
They can control what we hear and we see  
A corporate information monopoly
Don't believe what you hear unless you see proof
Forget all the fantasy and give me some truth.",Desperation
Cheap Sex,"Ritchie was an old friend of mine
He took lots of pills to pass the time
Used to be filled with political conviction
He started to struggle with heroin addiction

His skin turned cold and his face turned blue
Not yet 30 but it happened to you
Russian Roulette with a needle in your vein
A junkies life ends up the same

It seems like he changed overnight
He took more dope to feel alright
Didn't pay attention to the warning signs
Started living on borrowed time

His skin turned cold and his face turned blue
Not yet 30 but it happened to you
Russian Roulette with a needle in your vein

Shot a speed ball into his vein

Cheap Trick,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Waitin' for the Man / Heroin [Live-Tom Vocal][#]

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Como un planeta que me gira entorno
Y quema el fuego, she’s my baby

Uh Uh Uh Uh ella lo hace bien, se detiene
Uh Uh Uh Uh I don’t know
Sobre la piel leve de la nieve

Y me hace suspirar por los mares
Así celeste, she’s my baby
Y me hace blasfemar por las calles
Y quema el fuego, she’s my baby
Nunca lo entenderé, enciendes todo
Así celeste, she’s my baby
Como un planeta que me gira entorno
Y quema el fuego, she’s my baby

Podría ser de quien espera
Más en el fondo es solo mía",Cosi Celeste

I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real

Tarviin sua rauhottaa mun menoo, en pyrkyrii nuolee persettä, palvomaa mun egoo

Yo voy hablarte con lujos why detalles
Voy a confesar aunque no hare falta un padre
Para decirte que tu cuerpo me atrae
Que poco a poco yo me comienzo a enamorarme
Yo te confieso cual es el motivo
Por ti yo vivo
Soñando que tu vida la pases bien conmigo
Que mi destino te puso en mi camino
No puedo negarte que me quede sorprendido
Como a sido
Como asi sencillo
Esa es la razon por la cual tengo que decirlo
Why esa es la razon por la cual tengo que decirlo

A imaginar que tengo que hacer para poderte conquistar
Ojala que tu desicion sea gramal
E aqui nada se tiene con tan solo intentar
Es tu reto lo que tengo te prometo
Tenerme a prueba por un tiempo why veremos

Parecia un varilla why ahora se ve buena 
Se arreglo las gemelas ahora es que el gas pela 
Encomiendate al cielo why prende una vela

Chelsea Grin,"Who are you to decide what the meaning of perfection is 
And what makes you so high and mighty?
You're just like a weed slowly getting bigger but killing a beautiful rose
At the same time by taking all it's light and smothering it
I hope that feeling of being better then anyone else was worth it to you because
She's gone and can't ever come back
It's too late nothing can bring her back
It's worthless people like you that destroy something truly beautiful
You've caused innocence to die
Someone who didn't fit in with your bullshit ideals and finally came
To the point where she took her own fucking life
I hope you think about it every second of every day and you see her face when
You try to fall asleep at night
I hope it fucking haunts you
Perfection is what each individual makes it
Be in charge of your own life not everyone else's
Just yours",Cast from Perfection
Chelsea Grin,"This will be your bleak dissolution
I will rid the world of your filth
And I will scourge you with no remorse

I will abolish all the pain you've caused
By your pillage of the innocent
Your horrid fate will not be quick
Grisly horrors will fall upon you

I will make your insides
On the fucking outside
I'll tear through your skin
And watch you rot

So where's your pleasure now?
It's not so pleasing when you are the one
At the end of this misery

Oh but it is for me to sit
And watch you bleed
So say your final prayer

They consume and hide the real truth to a superstitious fear and stitch the mouth of all who interfere
You look into the world with blind eyes, always fearful of your demise
But you people don't seem to realize is that you're fearing a fucking myth
A tale that you comply with or be condemned to torment
Your loving idol would conflict woe and pain?
I won't be deceived by serpent lies or cry out to the sky
This goes out to all of those who've ever feared to really live because of all the sin and blasphemy
Pursue what you really want and don't let anything stop you no matter what get what you want.
Nothing bad will ever come from getting what you desire
Forget the ruler no one will ever find out
Living your life this way will only bring great satisfaction so take it all and give nothing
Or are these the words of a snake?
Now it's gone and you will feel the pain of life
You were blinded by your greedy mind and now it's time
This is now your new reality hope you enjoy the choices of your mortality

Last night's horrors were far to much for you to fucking take
You cry out in terror, corpses all around but you can't remember a thing
Who caused this crime?
Just then you look down and see the blood stained on your hands and clothes
Panicking you begin to run this can't be it must be a dream
But you're not just going to let this happen 
So you turn your back you won't accept this
So you put the bodies in the walls and under the floor boards 
No one will ever know what went on this horrible night
Sitting in the corner you don't know what's real 
Are all these things just in your head?
No way to tell you try to forget it and get it out of your head 
You try to convince yourself nothing was true
It's just a dream nothing is real you awake and sit there in fear 
Never to speak of this again because it's all just in your head",False Sense of Sanity
Chelsea Grin,"Why are we here?
A question that no one will ever answer so think for your fucking self
Don't believe something just because someone told you to 
And don't be scared into living someone else's way
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say 
Speak for yourself and never give that right away
I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life 
And if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence
I will live the way I want to and there's nothing you can say or do 
That will change me or the way I think
So save it for someone else
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through someone else's eyes
This is something you should never forget
If so then it's not really your life anymore
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say speak for yourself 
And never give that right away

Can you hear their screams?

When daylight dies they come and bring an abrupt end to your sinful life
There's nothing you can do to stop them now, it's too late
Just run and hide and hope they will never find you until it's over and they're gone
You think this is hell? You don't know the half of it, 
And this is just the beginning of the end for you
There's nothing sacred here, Everything you once loved has been defiled
There's only pain, and sorrow
They bring the end
And there's nothing that can save you from this cruel fate
But it's your fault, it is you that brought them
They felt the presence of your blackened heart
And smelt the stench of your abject existence
They've come to cleanse your soul of it's affliction
You can't repent because it's far too late
Just wait until they have you in their grasp
Now you will feel what it's like to be in hell
And your only company will be the horde
This is now the end your soul is cleansed your mouth is stitched your eyes are blind
And your blackened heart ceases to beat anymore, 
Now they have gone. Disappeared without a trace.

Slowly building fear inside
I seek everlasting sleep
Everlasting sleep
I'm bleeding out
Call to me beauty
Make me misery
When blood seeps through every pour
I am yours forevermore
Forevermore
To be human no more.
I want you to see the scars
You can't give me peace
I seek everlasting sleep
I want you to see the scars
You can't give me peace
I seek everlasting sleep

When blood seeps through every pour
I am yours forevermore",Everlasting Sleep
Chelsea Grin,"I fear no god or any man who stands in my way. My way.
I fear no devils I'm not afraid of fantasy or consequence
I want it all, everything, everyone
The words I preach they will obey
I want it all they can't stop me
Let me hear them all scream
This is the setting
Here I come alone, here I come the victor
Bringing the new order
I know one thing that won't change
We have no faith in what we are
Too sick and tired of the shame
By my hand I break these god damned walls
They will not forget my god damned name
By my hand they betray
By my hand they will collapse
By my hand the weak will be enslaved

He broke the bonds of a righteous man
Now he must stay in eternal flames

When the time comes they will make your choice.",The Foolish One

Embrace the taste of my decaying flesh
Like I embraced the taste of you
It rests inside your mouth
Decaying flesh rests inside your mouth
The sensation of my blood dripping off your tongue
I've seen you smile so bright
Seducing me into my last breath
A portrait of perfection stained seep red by the essence of my being
Seducing me into my last breath
My last breath ends with you
Sealed by a poisoned kiss
Embrace the taste of my decaying flesh
The sensation of my blood dripping off your tongue
I've seen you smile so bright
Seducing me into my last breath
My last breath",Last Breath
Chelsea Grin,"Look through my eyes and you decide if I'm a human being,
My soul was ripped from me.

Take me away.
I'll go down to the depths of this nightmare made real.
Taunted by demons, their voices so shrill.
I can feel the agony of the tortured souls tormenting me.
Exhume my mangled flesh and take me away from this death.

Liberate me.
Please!
This wasn't meant to be.
Oh dear god, my eyes burned through my head.
Why can I still see?

Stop the flow of my beating heart,
Suck the air from my blackened lungs.
And now you can see,
What I came to be.
You too will die,
And forever burn with me.
Burn with me.
Make my soul cease to exist.

I have given everything I am
Why must I feel empty
Will I ever feel again?
I have given everything I am
All must live with vivid nightmares of life after death
Plagued with images of a figure
How can I bare this?
Why must we bare this need to fulfill our nothingness they call serenity?
I want to break out of this place
To embrace this hate I shatter every mirror but yet you reappear
With a crooked smile and weathered face
The doors have been sealed shut
To keep the secrets that lie within
Through death's dark hollow I must fall to live in grave
Only when my heart stops I will truly live again
Shatter every mirror but yet you reappear
With a crooked smile and weathered face",Oblivion

A question that no one will ever answer so think for your fucking self
Don't believe something just because someone told you to 
And don't be scared into living someone else's way
Don't just say the things you're suppose to say 
Speak for yourself and never give that right away
I'm so sick of hearing people say how I should live my life 
And if I don't follow their rules I will suffer the consequence
I will live the way I want to and there's nothing you can say or do 
That will change me or the way I think
So save it for someone else
Never be afraid to open up your mind and look at the world through someone else's eyes
This is something you should never forget
If so then it's not really your life anymore

Forsaken, you're taken, you're blind
Now don't you feel alive?
Scream it, you mean it, you’re mine",Strung Out
Chelsea Grin,"Welcome back
Looking at ourselves
We look like someone else
We're drowning in our sorrow
With every fault we swallow

Feeling dead inside
It's something I can't hide
We are living for today
We don't care about tomorrow
We don't care about tomorrow no
We're just living for today

Welcome back
We've done this all before
I haven't found the cure
And I've never been so sure

Hit the ground
Rock bottom's where I'm bound
It's something I accept
Like the promises we never kept
We don't care anymore
We could give a fuck less about
We're just living for today

Welcome back
We've done this all before
I haven't found the cure
And I've never been so sure

Hit the ground
Rock bottom's where I'm bound
It's something I accept
Like the promises we never kept
I just don't care anymore
I could give a fuck less about being cured

Slowly kill ourselves
We tried to change but failed
We're drowning our sorrow
With every fault we swallow
It can't be denied
Our mind has long since died
We're just living for today
We don't care about tomorrow

We don't care anymore
We can give a fuck less about being cured",Welcome Back
Chelsea Krombach,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way

Chelsea Krombach,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Chelsea Krombach,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Chelsea Krombach,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of

In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight

Chelsea Krombach,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me

Chelsea Krombach,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Chelsea Krombach,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Chelsea Palermo,"Move over, sun, and give me some sky
I got me some wings I'm eager to try
I may be unknown but wait till I've flown
You're gonna hear from me

Make me some room, you people up there
On top of the world, I'll meet you, I swear
I'm stakin' my claim, so remember my name
You're gonna hear from me

Fortune, smile on the road before me
I am fortune's child
Listen, world, you can't ignore me

I've got a song that longs to be played
Raise up my flag, begin my parade
Then watch the world over start comin' up Clover
That's how it's gonna be

Chelsie Boyd,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him

Chely Wright,"Don't waste your time givin' me your reasons 
Let's skip the ceremony of goodbye 
Let's get down to the part where you are leavin' 
You can space me all the who, what, when's and whys 

[Chorus]
Go on and go 
Just hit the road 
You won't find me standin' in your way 
If you're not happy with me 
Then I'll gladly set you free 
Go on and go away 

You want to talk this through to make it easy 
A break-up just as painless as can be 
And there's that line that you never meant to hurt me 
Well, you're just trying to clear your conscience as you leave 

[Chorus:Repeat x2] 

Go on and go away",Go on and Go
Chely Wright,"All the boys he played cards with 
Couldn't wait til he came 
But they haven't seen him 
Since I got his last name 
He plays at home now 
And he always wins 
Those swingin' doors 
Don't do nothin' for him 

[Chorus]
Cause he don't do bars anymore 
That ol' jukebox 
Don't turn him on like before 
We dance to our radio 
On our own hardwood floor 
No he don't do bars anymore 

He used to sit on a bar stool 
Keepin' sad company 
Now he lays on the couch 
And he watches TV 
When he's wrapped up in my arms 
He knows what he's found 
So don't bother askin' 
For him to come 'round 

[Chorus]

No he don't do bars anymore",He Don't Do Bars Anymore
