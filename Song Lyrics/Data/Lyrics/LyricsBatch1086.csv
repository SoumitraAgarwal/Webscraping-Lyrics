Pete Murray,"For always I see you there
For always I hold your hand
For always be your man

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I had to go and
All is nothing without you, without you
Without you, without you

For always I see you there
For always I hold your hand
For always be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man

Please say something I want you to add
To this morning I had to go and
All is nothing without you, without you
Without you, without you

Please
Please
Please say something",Please
Pete Murray,"Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking

You know the clothes that you wear and the color in your hair
Shouldn't change you
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Mighty Joe

At least you think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet
Always so much fun to me,

At least I thought so

Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,
I don't think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You know the scene that you're in and the people that you've been with
Just get to me
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful,
Who you foolin'?

Well I'm here to tell you babe the game you're in is just a game, so damn pretentious

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You think you're so beautiful, so beautiful",So Beautiful
Pete Murray,"See your face just the other day 
Takes me back to the other place
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap 
And do the sweet things 
That we used to

At the place just the other day
And I ordered a drink the tonics on its way
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap 
And do the sweet things 
That we used to
I love you 
So come on girl 
Let's do the sweet things 
That we used to",Tonic
Pete Murray,"Be yourself
If you wanna know your name
Be your friends
And if you ever want to pay

All of this place
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place 
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place 
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And you know what you know
And you see what you bend
Can't believe it's insane
Come on and be what you mean",Class a
Pete Murray,"First time that I saw your face
I was blown away without a trace
I felt so alone on a busy street
When you passed me by
I felt my feet melt away
Melt away

I pray to God that I could meet
Somebody like the girl that I'd just seen
Someone that can stop me dead
Someone that will spin round, in my head, all day
In my head, all day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

That night I saw her again
Was the first time I touched her hand
She made me feel so warm
We talked all night, til the dawn came our way
Til the dawn came our way

But the timing was all wrong
When I met the one, I should've known
Instead I walked away
Leaving behind my destiny on that day
My destiny on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

But I still see her face
In my mind, it's the only place
And we will meet again
And I will touch your hand again, on that day
Your hand again, on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you",Fly with You
Pete Murray,"People, this is what I say tonight 
Master, I feel I am much too bright 

You all just sit here smiling 
And I cannot control myself 
When I know I'm right 
Oh and I can help you tonight 

Here it comes, fallin' down on your face 
Sometimes I just feel you're out of place 

Hey George, I think I can help you now 
Remember you brought this upon yourself 

You all just sit here smiling 
And I cannot control myself 
When I know I'm right 
Oh and I can help you tonight 

Here it comes, fallin' down on your face 
Sometimes I just feel you're out of place 
You always end up with egg on your face 

You all just sit here smilin' 
Hey you all just sit here smilin' 
Hey you all just sit here smilin' 
Hey you all just sit here smilin' 

Hey George, I think I can help you now",George's Helper
Pete Murray,"Sometimes I watch my life
And it slowly goes from black then into white
I know if you watch the time
Leaves you standing for a moment in life

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

So I wait to seize the day
With a clouded mind
And a hell of a load to pay
I find that if you know your way
You'll get out of this mess

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know that I'll find my soul",Lost Soul
Pete Murray,"And so it goes another lonely day
You're savin' time but you're miles away
Your flowers drowning in some bitter tea
For seeing lost opportunity

Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide
Don't go kid yourself, well not today
Satisfaction's not far away

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but your here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
Never miss opportunity

Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along

Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see
Soon you'll see
Soon you'll see

Pete Murray,"She just likes her coffee 
Hot and black and in the morning sun 
Proceeds to read the papers 
Right on through until the sport is done 
Don't you know 

[Chorus]

I will bring you roses 
Big enough to brighten up your day 
And I don't hold your hand now 
But I'm sure I'm well on my way

When you rise you start my day 
And you will be the one 
Who controls my every way 
Can you be 
Can you be my remedy

Pete Murray,"I don't know 'bout the plans 
That I have to save 
My security has never 
Been enough for me 
You must have been heaven sent 
Showed me there's more than payin' the rent 

[Chorus: ]
I've been passin' hours of my days 
Selling books and things 
I've been spending years of my life 
Having securities 

And I don't know 
What is right or wrong 
Sometimes I feel 
I'd be better off without this home 
And it's a hell of a waste 
When you're gone 
Holding all your things for so long 

[Chorus:] 

Yeah 

Sometimes I know that I have been told 
That I need a secure job 
So I can grow old 
But I haven't lived my life yet 
And I've never been out of this set

That we love to know 
Where'd the love

And pain is a sign 
That is old and abused

And we will walk forever
Come and touch my skin
You control my shiver
Feel the sunny day

Believe your time has come today
Go in your prime

Pete Murray,"Two years and I feel like I'm over this pill 
Is there a reason I wonder 
And still, you just light up the way 

I burn like the sunsets above me two feet 
My eyes are so tired I can't sleep 
And it's only a day 

[Chorus] 
And all of this heart is waiting for you 
And all of this mind falls apart for you 

Two years and I feel like I'm over this pill 
Is there a reason I wonder 
And still you just light up the way 

Your soul seems to guide like a bird 
And still even though with no word 
I will hold a place for your love

Two years and I feel like I'm over this 
Is there a reason I wonder 
And you still just laugh and wave",This Pill
Pete Murray,"I sit solo in a room 
Bright light on my face 
Interrogation consists of 
Two questions of my faith 

[Chorus:]
Come on break me 
Come on shake me 
You won't leave it alone 
Come on make me 
Come on break me 
I won't take it at home. 

I fall back onto the floor 
Bright light on my face 
Constriction consists when I breathe 
Fear I'm losin' my space

And it's been so long 
Since I heard you say 
And it's been so long 
Since I heard you say 
You don't trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me 
You don't trust me, trust me

You blossomed into a beautiful day
Your sunlight keeps shining in my face
I would see it even in deep out of space

And all in time, I know
I will see you again and again
And every night I'm going to hold you
And hold you and then

Before the light I will rescue
And then we'll begin to start it all over again

Pete Murray,"You saved me like you somehow owed me
Passion now flowing in my veins
Breathless days can sit alone in silence
You brought me sun and took away the rain

Honestly it's not a phase
Now I stand where before I couldn't raise
Even a smile just to get me through the days
You pick me up, you pick me up

You took me set my world on fire
Red stop light but you only see green
No mistakes you march on like you're wired
You lift me up to the greatest that I've been

Honestly it's not a phase
Now I stand where before I couldn't raise
Even a smile just to get me through the days
You pick me up, you pick me up

You pick me up making me fire
Do you even know how much you save

Take me now I have what I wanted
Bonfire high I'm all warm inside
Thank you how you've been more than I needed

Pete Neighbour,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On
Pete Neighbour,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

I walk along with you

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander,

Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

Pete Parkkonen,"I saw your face in a riot picture
In your eyes I could feel the friction
Once again, I want some of your attention
In for a split second

Turn a pacifist into art
Turn a communist into sharing bombs
Turn me inside out

You're my girl in a uniform
My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul

Sweet taste of a guilty pleasure
Tied down, I can feel depression
A scorning voice on the coldest defeat
Oh, you knock me off my feet
Turn me inside out

I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul

For you, I lose control 

Too much to (?) it's pretty sore
Too out of reach in to waging war
Go down like an atrocity
For a girl in a uniform
A burst of telepathy
For a girl in a uniform
For you, I lose control

You're my girl in a uniform

Throwing rocks at the embassy

Pete Petersen,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan

You are so inviting

Pete Rock,"I travel the land with the SP in my hand
Rock from New York, London and Japan
It`s time to take command expand to higher lands
P.H. the next man not in da plans
I`m dead serious like as in response I hit niggaz in the head
P.R. the thoroughbred comes through intellectual
I rap lyrical, always on da humble and sometimes I`m spiritual
Hands down accept any mans challenge
I strive and keep the competition off balance
Da fruits of my talent is this it`s simple
I drop science on the instrumental
I take seven ill drums put `em in a line
And add seven more snares to make it combine
It`ll take seven more horns before I start to rhyme
Now that twenty-one beats made up at the same time
I was bound ta shine haters get left behind
Ain`t no time for them, stamp my name on rap
Perhaps you hear da words from pay next sequel
Part two something for tha people
I`m still number one

Now I appear return ten years the pioneer
Deliver action thrillers that explode in ya ear
Compensate for all the ups and downs in my career
Stop the small talk my focus remains clear
Should have won a Nobel prize for thoughts and ideas
Critically acclaimed while some of y`all cats in tha game for fame
Fame lives in my name Pete Rock it`s simple and plain
Check it simply stressing it soon to start chin checking kids
God protected, so I`m selected to orchestrate the next great
And create, contemplate the world`s fate P.R. the heavyweight
Put these thoughts in ya mind while we on the topic
You can tell I`m still on it by the way I rock it
Full swing introduce the ninety-eight product
Niggaz talk the gossip but they ain`t got shit
I`m number one

This goes out to deejays and emcees
Unlock real hip-hop, Rock holds the key
Magnificent ya style is irrelevant
I`ll flip the bass and erase any trace of sample evidence
Trust a few men within this circle of thieves
Single out the enemy with ease
Earned every stripe on my sleeve
The five star general keep it moving ya rap needs improvement
So here`s a lesson ta learn, lyrics under fire burn third degree
And my steez is making hot tracks for G`s
World famous, salute my capabilities with 21 guns and ammunition
The SP runs 91 rounds precision on target with this rap bullet
First string team in position
The medal of honor hanging from my neck swinging
I`m still number one",#1 Soul Brother
Pete Rock,"Over the globe again from the realm of illadelph
The planet overwhelmed yo just brace ya self
Ya wanna go against me first face ya self I pose threat
To whoever within ya commonwealth the top ten

I'm crushing ya crap concoction
To the utmost examine this up close it's shockin'
Now mic droppin' is only ya option
Here come the spliff scientist in the flesh have you forgotten

His excellency the most poetically inventive official hip hop shit
That's ya incentive to cop this actual fact and not the likeness
'cause possibly clones'd try to do it like this
Fathom this lyrically fabulous vocabulist

Hold mic like four fifth and lick shot somewhat like Pete
Malik rock think not I don't smoke I just sleep drink and eat
Think pot and I want the top a vehicle that brakes
God I want the top a vehicle that brinks got composing

To the ink sock my hip hop is wild megawatts
Continue with forever exist and never stop
Yo whut up whatever ock we can thicken tha plot because

Rob O it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time

I'm Rob O what, energize like a power plant blow speakers
Without an amp do things these wack rappers can't
And start again 33 RPM the hearts of men
Are cold like the steel I hold on microphones

Let my words express move men like chess
My mic will stand erect like projects
It's drastic top draft pick in this rap shit
You just a fraction caught up in tha midst of action

My catalog is current events breath the contents
What I move crowds for local events the show stopper
98 feature spot rocker Rob Odendo
Now every MC wanna mention me out of envy

Unofficially top of the charts I played my part
Held it down from the start you know the M.O.
Yeah yeah Rob Odendo

Rob O it's time for that and it's about that time
Pete Rock it's time for that and it's about that time
Black Thought it's time for that and it's about that time

Yo it's the Capital P book rhymes of the century
Speak rap line essentially on tha M I see
I hold the mic appliance like science
My competitors and clients worldwide as my words coincide

With real life think twice transmit like true lies
It's televised take my manuscripts out of context
Who want next situation is complex
Stop the nonsense it's 98 time to set the record straight

Separate movers and shakers from those that hesitate
Ya featherweight name carry weight in every state
Ya name brand no frills niggaz is marinate

It's Pete Rock new world innovator
Crush imitators five years since the creator
It's nuff said as I paint the town red and move ahead

And it's time for that and it's about that time
It's time for that and it's about that time

Bright as fuck, congruent like four sides of a square

And put it together that nigga O.C.'s quite clever
Always and forever no one can do it better

It's on point fella
Ain't nothing you can tell us
Word up

Since day one when I came upon the scene
For this mic I fiend respect played a part before the cream
I figure respect last longer because cream come and go
I done seen five to ten and even fifteen a show and blew it
Now I know now my ill escape is real estate
No more will I make that mistake
Respect is what matters cause that shit hold weight

Word up ya gotta earn respect in ninety-eight
Rehabilitate the rap game honor our name
Hold it down to the last frame
No doubt emergency escape route
Take the easy way out if that's what you about
If not then show ya heart
Create light from dark all aboard the ark
As the rain falls I reminisce on biggie smalls
And Tupac the new world is yours
80 pause for the cause
Respect due

Respect on the mic we in this for life
For the street thug to my brother with same blood
One love yo sound off the twenty one slug salute

Pete Rock,"From the basics and warm, weather places
Dedicated to the brothers that never made it
Cut short, they prime read life between the lines
Photographed by rhymes yo it's hard times
All across the nation cold points of frustration
Created hot joints of illustration
Concentrate while stakes are high falling victim to the lie
Keep a sharp eye there's a steady supply of hate in the air
To them cats who stare the ice grill with the glare
But everything is fair in the city the sheisty the shiftee
I'n the epitomee of a raw deal now carry a sword and shield
And walk with a forcefield for real I overcame the odds
And got the hell out of dodge soul survivor of the war
And master in charge

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live nigga keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

I watched the whole world from the side of my eye
I seen a lot of cats die and evil men lie
On the road to riches in pursuit of my wishes
It's a close call between friends and snitches
On the low the game brought moments of pain
Strong emotions plus the hardships of fame
No need to live forever just keep some type of cheddar
A buttersoft leather to rock in cold weather
Times are mad real official like the seal
Try to understand what I feel
My word to the wise it's where ya heart lies
Keep your biz straight far from family ties
I'm the illest soldier that represents the culture
Dignified bywords like fresh, fly and ultra
Champion heroics and passionate poets
Flashback to the future let it self focus

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But beautiful black sisters keep risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

Still in basement for four years arranging
Lyrics and beats my first lote engagement
It's outstanding the boy wonder's back in the world
By popular demanding on top commanding
My own destiny go ahead try to test me
I been living right so expect no less g
Got positive reaction and affirmative action
The soul survivor guaranteed satisfaction

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live people keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

And if I die before I wake I pray go God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die before I wake I pray to God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving

Sunrise, starts the day
Lay back, ease your pain
Don't sweat, simple things
Take your time, do your thing

[pete rock]
As grains of sand pass from hand to hand
I watch time stand still I'm just one man
That's out for all so all should be for one
Grew up on the drum with the j.b. unh!
The son, who spun the record that his pop's collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family get down!
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

Chorus: jane eugene and carl mcintosh

Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time

Feel the flow, and let it go
Unwind, relax your mind
Stay a while, take your time

My goal sees the world pass from young to old
Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale

Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

Snatch rza last piece of fish right off the glass dish
Butter roll beats bagel tracks wavey hair decks
Lay it down straw hat style, butterball crown
Time life investments, when broke I wrote the old testament
Crashed domes now perform excellence
Words with the president, brunch with yeltsin

Pete rock bang your head, break the drumsticks
Verbal assault, rhymes rippin through the mix
Specialist, with the smash hits that can flip
Savagely attack this, clash with, accurate aim
Spark the flame, burn this inside the vein
Ride tracks like the soul train, hold ya brain
In the state of shock, make em drop hits of cocaine
I bang with the big boys, those who hold name
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains
I swing blades, best bring grenades against
A tru master, way beyond your freshman attempts
Spit rounds on the floor, evidence of the war
It's on til the death til we settle the score
You can never measure, to the standard, of the most
Popular demanded, rap classics
Pop corks while the style knock your tops off
Ghetto summer jam's got the streets blocked off
Plots to knock me off get stopped short
Armed with my thoughts, move the world with an unknown force

Aiyyo, we had the bass pound speakers, shell toed adidas (uh-huh)

Transmit def styles with sign language in braille
In hot pursuit of donald trump rap loot
Produce what you feel with navy seal mic troops
Spark the s-p, slaughter, pete rock of gibraltar
Miraculous lyrics that tread water
A rap nigga, show respect, write rhymes that connect
Collaborate, break bread with kurupt and deck
Keep my feet blessed, fresh with the scottie pippen's
In the game of life, I play all positions
Stop look and listen, total package, yes a true master
Produce rhymes, slang hits faster
The master of the game, solo artist by name
Paint the masterpiece that lies inside the frame
Passionate bright colors, the number one soul brother
All eyes on us, guard your grill and take cover

Aiyyo, we had the bass pound speakers, shell toed adidas (uh-huh)

I'm the epicenter of this natural disaster

Masters of self, a whole carload of explosives

Death with the intellect from wizards to warlocks
I'm sore ock, I'm raw ock with four glocks, smallpox
More ways to get paid, more ways to display
More rhymes to say, more ak's to spray
God is good growin up in the hood
Done some things bad, done some things good
Me and pete is like rhymes to chemicals, clash
Atom bombs to mustard gas
We intervene, I break ya, take ya to a whole difference scene
Are-15's and beams
Got em jumpin like I swallowed a gang of jumpin beans
Explode and reload, we dumps machines
Radical in war, kurupt's a mad star

",Tru Master
Pete Rock,"This I dedicate to the girl I rate 
 As a ten then again she was probably an eight 
 Her ass was kinda phat so she moved me yo 
 When I scoped out her mental was straight said let's roll 
 Stared this shorty everynight and everyday 
 On the rebound around left right and hey 
 I'm a critical brother when it comes down to broads 
 But this wop here is like the Grammy Awards 
 Had style and grace and class a lot of taste 
 On a slow dance we romance around my place 
 Like a king from queens is how she made me feel 
 And if I did dirt it was locked and sealed 
 No doubt was all about me and my love thing 
 If the phone called Paul I was lettin it ring 
 Absolutely, she looped me the hook was good 
 Niggaz buggin on me buggin in my neighbor hood 
 Yeah boss, but on course is my game plan and 
 Shorty wop keep me chillin with the name brand 
 Kicks and whips, going all out chicks, flicks and tours 
 Yeah you know who you is kid truly yours 
 This I dedicate to the mixtapes I hate 
 Exclusive shit it really holds no weight 
 Put ya skills on the plate backspin to eighty-eight 
 Now this I dedicate to a girl I hate 
 Try to post fly with ya Mabeline eye 
 Sportin DKNY working on ya alibi 
 Imitation at best Miss American Express 
 Dismiss the charge, cool G Rap and Large Pro 
 Here to let you know were not the mens 
 I'm through with you but still talk ta ya friends 
 Don't stop to say hi or even reply 
 The position is filled with fresh new material 
 Keep ya head up, catch some black cat luck 
 Sped off in my truck not givin a fuck 
 Lookin At My Front Door, it's locked and closed 
 So I use the window for all you ninety-eight hoes 
 Ave yo go head hood rat 
 I can't see where ya any good at 
 Put that trash back on tha rack 
 You a put back a stripper 
 Just like a chicken peckin wherever wood at 
 You sewer rat better be careful where you step ya foot at 
 You might get snapped, caught in the trap 
 Sneekin bout a cheese stack so sewer that and ease back 
 You fleece that it's G Rap many cats want to be that 
 Better believe that iced up, find me where it's below zero degrees at 
 Skis at see the G stack puffin on scarface and Garcia Vegas 
 G Rap and Pete Rock we bond papers 
 Both of us together we bomb makers bottles of Dom breakers 
 Many mansions on farm acres pushin porches with four doors 
 Diamonds with no flaws with the pretty mamas 
 on beaches of Bahama shores 
 Pinky ring is like a stone age without the dinosaurs 
 Comin from me G Rap yo, truly yours",Truly Yours '98
Pete Rock,"Introducing c.l. then face defeats
Then I remind you of third street when it was sweet
See'd us move on and grow to another plateau with me and ....
Havin that dough
In the last days when critical times are left
To deal with my grand daddy's endeavors
Whut corrected my errors the first shot came in 91
E.p. done my struggle
To label this untouchable foundation due in 92 top ten review
Respect new when that flew they reminisce over you
Had marie too, sporting my nike's at the door
Paper saw the main ingredient l.p. in 94
Now it's me the bold coppin toys for dolo
At ease he'd rather die at his feet than live on his knees
Don't mistake the forest for trees
Off course why try and climb a mountain
A baby walk across in tha military mindset place ya bet
Ya fumbled all those chicks with the bucks off safety
Skirt chasin what they rate me in this whole rap affair
Butwhen it really comes down to it who cares
Like the tortiosse and the hare ya know the race I run
But ya losin all the nights, let the rabbit get the gun
Number one wit a bullet and pit named black
It's the best that ever did it on a pete rock track

Aye yo two cool cats who reclaim the name
Pete rock and c.l. smooth in this here rap game
But the good news is that there is a crew
Not 5 not 4 not 3 da two

In tha beginning let it be like the record spinning
As a child I stack 45's in a pile blow the dust off
Put it on before I can walk
Play static on my pop dukes automatic
I knew I wasn't average music in my bloodstream
My pops watch his son live his dream
Now as time flew the original classy rock crew
Shine through on streets and avenues
The next chapter you read it mc shan said it
Got ta give the man behind wheels credit
Yes yes y'all bls and marley marl
The rap attack put my talents on the map
Now it's pete rock for days in tha basement
As I amaze watch me blow in 98 ways
I specialize in rap dj and produce wit more
Hot tracks then carlos dejesus

Chorus 2x

What it look like ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still riding with c.d.'s and leather roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket how long it take
To reup and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And what not to do here's my crew now you get yours to bare witness
It's nothing personal it's business
That's my word which is my bond, behind writing ta step back
And watch it all tighten stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wis that ya know who the enemy is furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then x ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let c.l. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
'cause we on it like this to tha last stop
The next humprhev bogart mastering art
Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, take'em apart
Don't start whut ya can't finish
When ya bubble wit skills that never diminish
Ya best team against mine is a light scrimmage
So play like popeye and eat spinach

Yo, Terror Squad, Pete Rock collabo' 
From git-go, yo yo 

Aiyyo it's such a shame 
all these dick riders tryin to corrupt the game 
But what it bring, nuttin but pain 
and one in your fuckin brain 
Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin 
I'm still violent I've been waitin for this moment 
like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer 
Hyper than hype, when fightin to fight 
It's like, tonight is the night 
And I ain't even tryin to let a nigga slide 
I've been dyin to get a gat 
I dared to try now prepare to die 
I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any 
soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? 
I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact 
Fully backed by bullies who be peelin caps 
I sack the rapper like li-nebacker, play my rhyme backwards 
you can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics 
Things get drastic, Express for my plastic 
I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick 

[Chorus: Pete Rock] 
Grab ahold cause you never heard a 
verbal murder like this 
Cash comes before soul, so watch your shit 
Every cat want to be enormous 
Plottin on the next one 
Murder one (repeat 2X)

Aiyyo my whole circle, make you feel it like The Color Purple 
My niggaz comin through and still hurt you 
Wipe why'all Kleenex cats who stay full of germs 
We hit Fifth Ave, while why'all still hit Stern's 
Don't really care bout why'all, really hear bout why'all 
Yo on our side we do our thing, play the cut 
let the phone ring, Pete Rock connect team 
From M-V to L-see, my thugs straight thuggin it 
Snatchin niggaz out of the booth, unpluggin it 
Strange Fruit, my niggaz live to shoot 
Yo it's a strange thing, a nigga never had a suit 
Yo so bust what happen, remember the unknown's a clap-man 
Cat stackin, move out the hood that's in Manhattan 
Got big headed, misleaded, then dreaded 
Yo the beef deaded, his whole squad afraid to set it 
Yo I heard son, son is rockin iceberg Dunn 
Got up out the hood, wouldn't believe that, this cat would 
Head mad swollen, flamboyant this man golden 
Yo the Senator, crime sinister, John Dillinger 
Better respect my words or I'm the minister

This stud bumped into me, beef it was fin' to be 
My Appetite for Destruction is finnicky 
He was an industry type, influenced by magazines and snipes 
Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense 
that deliver words with intents to kill 
Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel 
I peeled some raps back, that peeled his cap back 
Fucker thought I was Abstract, now his life is backtracked 
In the center of the party his crew identified the body 
Left him signin the wait-list sayin, ""I can't take this

Who'll be the sucka MC to get dismantled
I hope that you can handle your whipness or sees ya flippin gettin
Down with my lazy boy laidback style of speak
The funk makes you dance cheek to cheek
I be the black civilian who is bound to make a million
Or make enough loot so I can buy my own provillian
Throw a fat party and invite everybody
And play all the old school hits like Lodi Dodi
Connections like OPEC while ya hung up like a Kojak
I'm real like a ruby while ya fake like a pinchback
That's imitation gold if you didn't know
My rhymes flow as my vocab' grows and grows
I freak it for the basslines always walkin on ya frontline
Catch me while I'm boomin' in ya alkine
Yo I'm out like a shot from a tec
You need to think twice just to earn respect, so

To others, gotta lay low, undercover
Cats flow to the hands for the crowd in the stands
So here I am, plus I rock to please the public

To hear the Soul Brother disperse words of wisdom
When InI comin' direct on the set
So represent, a lot of rap niggaz came to win
But the style played out when they chose a different route
Whatever as I stay true to the game
Word to the troubled T-Roy you know my name
Keep an eye on the stakes as I watch my back
Think Twice before you try to grab the mic and react

First of all, you better count your blessings
When you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy
To all my ladies, who want tickets, enjoy
'Cause I spit it and you gotta get with it and you'll never forget it
Yes, I want the best out, count 'em all

You tell 'em this is history in the making, avoiding disasters
This run is for the green jacket, I fit the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

Hard work payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch and left us two
Now you know we can't let that pass to get that cash
We in the big numbers, count 'em all

Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us

Why my uncle doc left me everything when he died
And when pop passed, two weeks later I cried
And when great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby

Can't talk bad about me, she tell 'em why we need to give her
All those roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we was
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind

Ghetto's of the mind while I'm in my prime
I left, so y'all can catch up, I'm ahead of my time
Your legacy and that lazy boy say it ain't fear
My next generation triple my digits, add 'em up like

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate

Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want, beef
No y'all don't want, that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

Word to my cousin, the truth and no lie
Me and my dawg was in his brand new Land, puffin' on lye
Tameka came by, glossy-eyed as she cried
Lil' Jay got sprayed with a chrome four-five

That's my motherfuckin' man, get in the Land
Head to the rest, grab vests, switch whips to the Caravan
I heard an ambulance right up the block
Plus more shots, the shit's gettin' hot, pull up and park

By the back, pass the gat, hit the lights and lay back
Hold up, now roll up, yo where them niggaz at?
I know one of them cats from the projects with Jay
The first nigga move, I'ma pull this gun, spray

No delay, we stay night to fuckin' dawn
It's on, my head spinnin', feelin' my cheeks get warm
Tears drip as I stepped out the whip
Slipped a clip, had to get hit, uh-uh that's that bullshit

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

Yo, I can't believe my man since 3rd grade got sprayed
Bullet laced as he laid, chokin' up blood with no aid
Made money for the purpose of his daughter
Victim of an unmerciful slaughter, explain harder

Or don't bother, I'ma heat yo' ass like lava
Identified was that tinted gray Chevy Impala
Fleein' the scene, as the back tires screamed
Now for them my man [Incomprehensible], ruined his whole dream

Of playin' ball pro, bitch that's how it go
You let me know, I'll hit your whole fuckin' team with the metal
Mental struggle got my hand under the bubble
Tryin' to blow steam and leave the scene blood puddles

Snakes, whattup nigga? These niggaz ain't explainin'
Well, fuck it then, it's time for some gestratin'
Hit him in the worthless shell he came in
Murder is a sin, but it's worse him dyin' on revenge and I ain't havin' it

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

I ain't havin' it, reached in the bubble and grabbed it
Automatic cocked back and squeezed through his Polo fabric
Nigga duckin' and runnin', irrationally gunnin'
Thinkin' to myself, do I gotta hit someone

Then I heard shots from a back route
Fired back out, got shot, dropped and blacked out
Put in a clap out, didn't map out or act out the plans
Now I'm consciously layin' while bullets is sprayin' the Caravan

We can't lose, I hear shotguns then 22's
Left arm booze, or blood soaked through my Adidas shoes
Heavy breathin', a lot of bleedin'
Bitches screamin', put over on my good shoulder, started squeezin'

Out the back window, she gave the wrong info
Suddenly crashed into a Pinto
Hopped out, flew through the back yard, word to God
It's on and I felt the gat slip through my palm

Kept runnin', hopped the fence, hopin' that I didn't leave prints
Spotted a black Ac' parked with dark tints
Broke the passenger's side, hotwired the wide and slide
Another unsolved homicide

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that

Pete Rock,"It's Talib Kweli in the place to be Brooklyn
Most definitely yaknowhatImsayin', Mount Vernon
And Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, the brothers who brought ya
Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah, right about now, we about to make history

The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggaz don't sell crack is they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
'Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the field though

I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix coke with the Henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denis
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'

The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this, you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with porters and keys just like the leachious mind

I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine
If you ready to roll than we can rock shit
My niggaz so cold we hot

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

Psychedelic we sell it and niggaz jealous fellows
Go get your hate up get your weight up, I'm tellin' you straight up
You need to turn that frown upside down you use less muscles
The smile is easier than it sound, it's true

Lookin' all crooked, I be tellin' these dudes
They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiend before the camera screaming, just shoot me

Now they scream a million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we packed us the way of the gun
Like tape digs, raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state

Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggaz buggin' me, I need a fuckin' pesticide

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

You put light back to life 'cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, rap the fight
Battle right through the afterlife
'Cause when you die make you look way past the life

And high sight, I drop the type of rhyme to give the blind sight
Sparkle a shine bright like lemon lime, sprite up in the limelight
Yeah as we still at the track, you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet, official would kill it

'This is fake the way we sill it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got Pete to make you chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggaz sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black

I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at
This Guerrilla Monsoon Rap first comb rap
Soon rap come through a crossroads and all these lost souls
Will stand out with stress signals like morse code

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly

Yo, master of ceremony, controlled territory
It's Tay, the mad journalist always trying to write a better story
And laying tracks 'cause it's better for me
Calm but predatory, sun niggaz even when the weathers stormy

My crew is down to do whatever for me
Got my back like scoliosis when I'm handling mine
Find it hard, though to manage my time
Between the gaming and rhymes, without severing my family ties

But yo, that's what happens when the world is loving you
Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a double you

I know it sound crazy, right?
Even though it's hard sometimes I still got to stay in the mix
It's Pete Rock on the snare drums and laying the kicks
And on the real I wouldn't trade it for shit

P.R. and L.B. got that shit for blocks
Hip hop when we walk, hip hop when we talk
You can hear it our slang and see the New York

We bought back 94 when the music was pure
Everybody made jams 93' and before
Hearing 'Illmatic' first on the trip to the store
Lost my mind but I knew it was
That we had to work toward forward

On we move now, my life is the roof
Putting the pen to the pad when it's time to spread news
Daily digesting some more wack shit
Mother-fuckers better stick to the script
We need you back Jay

y'all dudes know now we not for play
You want it funky, come around my way
(For Real)
You can choose to rock or choose to roll
I chose Pete 'cause he got the soul

Ill Capitan, never roll a foot solider
We push over, you pushovers
Lil' pussies need to douche over

Mass and Gills, Scott hare will make em' gush over
Pussy and poetry, two things that's good for ya
We rock hard just like the hood told us
That fake shit I never could show you
We ought to keep it true and authentic

In they videos trying to walk wit it
L.B. put the street talk in it
From right now till the day that we forfeit it
Just making sure that y'all get it in time to put my heart in it

Pete Rock,"[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Tot game is crazy diamonds off the lettle
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wive
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life",It's a Love Thing

E'ry day, spend superstar rapper bucks
Go to the dealer, cop trucks after trucks
High as a kite, rollin' dutch after dutch
Honey leavin' the scene with me
Now she wanna get a room, but at one nineteen with me
Lowrider jeans, fanny pokin' out the pants
Do the snake, the wop and the uh-oh dance, ohh!

And just how thirsty all these hoes is
Wide door knockers with the rings in they noses

I start checkin' my peep mo'
I come from Harlem, the home of the hustler negroes
Like, R.P., Alpo
Jim Ice, Nicky Barnes, and my nigga Bumpy John
All I need is a pair of my Pro*Keds
Half moon part and a two-wheel moped
Quarter water, Jimmy Chu's for my honey
It's the Postaboy, Winning Team, good money

I said throw yo' lighters in the motherfuckin' urr
The roof on fire and not a muh'fucker curr

Bitches tongues out like back in the day in the theatres (woo!)
And the heaters is kept where they supposed ta
Smoke ya like the welcome poster

Keep knots like a crumb snatcher boy

I lunge at you niggaz with a bolo punch
It's the, Boy Wonder at the cruise control
Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that
13 in the game, makin classic rap
And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
Wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this
Music, number one sound, overground
Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know

4 pound Ã¢??ell send ya to Esau
In other words, Jesus Christ man
My shit stick together like beans and rice
All I need is weed at nights to smoke and burn
And IÃ¢??m probably the nicest nigga to breathe the light
And canÃ¢??t nobody prove me wrong IÃ¢??m too strong
And the motherfuckinÃ¢?? street niggas needing me right?

Ayo fuck what you heard and what you thought you saw
Been all over the world reppinÃ¢?? 914
Styles P and Sheek Louch they wild for sure
Been all over the world reppinÃ¢?? 914

Raised in the ghetto singing songs for survival
Late night, Valhalla, roll it out the bible
914, every corner store got a nigga with the raw
Just bring your straw
Piff by the OÃ¢??s, pussy galore
Little thief bitches get the monkeys out the store (shit ainÃ¢??t real)
Shit look real but a nigga ainÃ¢??t sure, yo
You know a real nigga when you see him (Yonkers)
Jewelry dripping, white tee, you wanna be him
Burner on him and donÃ¢??t care about freedom (frrrruck dat)
Bitches with him, other girls wanna beat him
IÃ¢??m trying to stay alive, what up Mt. Vernon?
Rest in peace two-five, Pete with the knot
Who else to ask for but Sheek from D-Block?
Two guns down, Calico up
IÃ¢??m done here pass my cup

Ayo fuck what you heard and what you thought you saw
Been all over the world reppinÃ¢?? 914
Styles P and Sheek Louch they wild for sure
Been all over the world reppinÃ¢?? 914

Nigga I get fresh like Easter
Who wanna get slicked like pizza
While I light my reefer?
You could come through with your crew nigga
Burner go through niggas
One shot is knockinÃ¢?? off two niggas
I might come through with the Uzi, shoot niggas
Film on Fuji, put the shit in a movie
Who wanna get burned with a loosie?
Black tie affair, I grown up you get stomped with the GucciÃ¢??s
You outta be playinÃ¢?? me two feet
I donÃ¢??t need five, I gotta knife you ainÃ¢??t leaving alive
I said the green and cream Beamer is mine, the Z8
I see hate, get the three-eight right in your eye
Yo Pete, play shit for the street
Niggas licking they heat
Got a brick in the whip on the seat
Them niggas no different than me
So they listen to me
I understand all the shit that they see, what?

Ayo fuck what you heard and what you thought you saw
Been all over the world reppinÃ¢?? 914

Pete Rock,"Uh! Man I never did no shit like this before man
I just keep hearin' this fuckin' voice in my head man
It's like it's good vs. evil really man
On one side I hear somethin', 
And on the other side I hear some other shit

It feel like fire (fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you nocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is hate!)
And I'm a catch you a homicide
They killed your cousin in your face and you 'gon' let it slide?!
(But I got plans for ya, do this for me I'll show ya how my child adore ya)

[Chorus] 
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

Now do it just how we planned
(Get right up on him and blam!)
You can do it from the front or behind
(But I wanna see a nigga lose his mind)
And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
And I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet,
I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, 
And don't nobody love you like I do)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!)
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

My child! I have a place you could rest
And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin'!)
Keep on gunnin', keep on hustlin'
(Plus I know how to make it pop)
Oh you a hot boy? I know you like it hot
(So give a nigga up, go 'head, wear a wire set a nigga up)
(And all your care about is Benji's)
Triflin' you don't feed the hood, you stingy!
(And it's just a dream and it don't seem right)
(You ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

Back to, Pete Rock and Smif-n-wessun lyrics
These lyrics are not available for printing.",This One
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to catch wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

C.L. Smooth, get busy",The Creator
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool 
Catching a suntan and everything's cool 
Male or female  you want to be set 
In the big mansion drinking Moet 

You read the Wall Street Journal 
Later for the comic 
Far from dumb because you practice logic 
You lived poor in the ghetto 

Never had the money easily 
But you found the remedy 
So you  your girl  and your kids could have a better opportunity 
And teach them all about unity 

Cultivating in the brains the words of Allah the master 
And they go far 
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground 
Indeed to help another that's down 

A tough situation cuts like a knife 
In search of the good life 

From the church, the home, on down to the prison 
People want to know how is he and she living 
Does he work? 
Do you wonder if his life will bloom? 

Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon? 
How's the mother? 
Do they ever go visit the brother? 
What about the dad? 

I heard he drinks undercover 
Some are still shooting up, another on crack 
Just the other day trooper got sent back 
What type of life do you lead? 

Tell me 
'Cause you can be anything you want to be 
Some will strive for the good life in any case 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 

On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color 
Hear me now, brother 
All around the world the husband and wife 
Work night and day in search of the good life 

The G double O-D L-I-F-E 
Living in luxury 
Care free 
Period 

No time to waste 
We catch ours all day 
We work instead of play 
I B-U-I-L-D inside me 

Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city 
From a paranoid mental delusion 
Plain and simple 
I won't cause confusion 

Yo, that's your fault 
Stop the somersault 
'Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt 
My destiny I define is heavenly 

So, Fort Knox, open sesame 
Light shines and the birds keep singing 
As I still cling to my positive upbringing 
With the need to succeed, right? 

On a natural high

Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

[CL Smooth]
I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca want to bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I`m about to hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That`s right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C`mon

[Grand Puba]
Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah...

Nowadays I`m on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)`ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it`s hard like Charles Bronson
It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

[Pete Rock]
That`s right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz

[Cl Smooth]
C`mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

[Pete Rock]
Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

[CL Smooth]
Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
How I hit the skinz, uhh
It`s fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don`t try to show
Because I`m, the accurate man
Everybody knows it

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigger, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tune up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Beat to my feet is a lock like concrete
Hard for the street, decipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Worn like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita Pita, I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",Act Like You Know
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"""You know, nowadays it, seems like there's a lot of..
Bad things going on and, I guess a lot of it,

South Africa, what does it mean?
To burst the scene, or conquer like a philistene
War or peace, which one do you prefer?
Pass me my M-16 for the disaster
A reason for the treason in a jet black season
For peace, justice, and freedom
For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens, is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adam-ite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Lie-braries; broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television; tell-a-lie-vision
A schism; negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation

Some walk slow, cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then house negro; today, civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause - aim, rationale?
Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave the basement

The basement, put the funk in grand
Here comes my man
My brother, grap lover, get wreck cousin, c’mon

Call me the grap lover, yes, the younger soul brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won’t find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don’t slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you’re soon to discover
Yo, that’s the kid from mecca and the soul brother
Yeah once in a while I be with cl on the dl
Or I flow with pete, and find my placement in the basement
The basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, grapster’s out the door of the basement

Of the basement! next we got, a special guest
I ain’t gonna tell you who it is
C’mon, rap along

Tick tock tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I’m tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I’m never strapped
But I know a crew of young guns that’ll send you back
So easy does it on the dl
Peace to Pete Rock, and the mecca don cl
Heavy d’s on this track, lettin' you know there’s no replacement
Peace signin' off, check one two straight from the basement

Straight from the basement
I’m tellin' you now, kid
It’s crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up? 

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the wig out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin', upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the u.s. states, even London
Past time present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a dolphin, so call me don shula
A raider well like art shell, crazy defense
A pro bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is cl smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The pimp daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from the basement

That’s right, crazy funky
Aw my man
He’s crazy funky, his name is rob-o, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you’ll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, Pete makes beats in the basement
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I’d just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint’s bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the ? 
I hear voices sayin', that’s rob-o’dingo in the basement

Ah ha ha ha! hah yeah! this is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like snoopy, the beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin' raw papes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I’m comin' to town but you just can’t wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin' of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in the basement

In the basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with cl smooth
My man ? ,rob-o, g-r baby pah

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Ah  yeah  yes 

Psychedelic 

Uh  come on 

This is what I like 

It's that Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth stuff 

Uh huh  yeah 

Brothers can't understand 

You know I'm about to drop a funky beat on you 

Like this... 





Hit the war drums that vibrate the earth underneath 

Here my people and I come  gotta wake up the chief 

Not a pale frail ghost  C.L.'ll wreck the most 

'cause the Mecca land never had a Leo Africanos 

The Sudanian, master of the Mediterranean 

And if it's lovely I'm the one you're Skypagin' 

Lower than the Mole Man, R&B, you're silly 

The only male hardcore crusin' through my city 

Rise to the supernova, swami like Bola 

Heavy hitter I consider Ueuker leanin' on my shoulder 

Measure like a yardstick, thick at arithmetic 

You add it up and I roast a high pick flick 

Hit the pitch and then I'm gone as the funk lingers on 

I don't publicize here to keep the black race torn 

But steady at an altitude where you get the mental food 

Not to be rude, here's a fresh pot brewed 

Oh, what a web we weave when we practice to deceive 

Sparkin' off a trick up the sleave 

Pete stocked the bedrock, listen and you'll see 

And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me 



Yo, you can't front 

It's like that, c'mon, yeah 

Yes, you know I got to talk 

You can't front 

I'm tellin' you now 

C.L. Smooth and the Rock, c'mon 



Many consumed what was locked in a tomb 

That I gradually groomed, coming out now smelling like perfume 

So take a whiff when I wrap a gift, play ya like a gospel 

A logical apostle, colossal (whoooweee!) 

Afro, a cut me like a fade with a Braun 

Sport a bald head, but never needed Hair Club for Men 

Drop a SCUD, fully-capable, a form in a eclipse 

Skips to backflips soon as it leaves my lips 

Suave know, I can make the funk turn the habit 

Kick the old 45 and I can boogie on static 

Welcome to the Brahma Don, pilgrimage to Mecca Don 

A prayer for the parish, Soucron Affwaun 

'cause ain't no misbehavin' when they manage what you're cravin' 

Put the ""Anger in the Nation"" on your station 

Anvils that fills the whole circumference 

And black people crowd in a mass abundance 

To hear Gabriel's horn, blow it like a Naiji 

What's the flavor unit with the top priority? 

C.L., untouchable with the clip full 

Impossibly, the posse can't front on me 



Don't you dare front 

Don't you dare front 

Not on me 

'cause I'm the man 

C.L.'s the rhymer 

Right on time 

Right on, my brother 

Come on, kick another verse for me 



You desire the messiah for the entire empire 

Total organizer of the earth, wind, and fire 

C.L. and Pete Rock unlock the hard rock 

Many want to mock and the honey-dips clock 

Intercontinental for the residential 

Never coincidental, rough on a rental 

Count all the bars numeric 

Pro-prosthetic if ya let it resurrect the nongeneric 

The brother on the cover, yes, a rapper not a singer 

If you recognize him, point with your index finger 

Shock another flock when I hit the block 

God or Devil on the set that's level, labeled as a rebel 

In retrospect I detect those incorrect 

And reflect the black power project 

Supreme 'cause I chose to never blaspheme 

Going to the extreme, place it on a very high beam 

And drop jewels for five thousand fools who stampede 

'cause the proper show stopper's what ya need 

So come and get a taste of the dynamic duo 

And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me (Yoooo!) 



You can't front, boy 

'cause we're the skilled fools (skibooze?) 

We'z are the funk 

The hardcore funk 

We ain't no joke

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark lover, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cuz I can do wonders under cover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like blue nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The cut don't flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man

Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man

Music please

The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla

Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man, for Pete's Sake, c'mon",For Pete's Sake
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green
The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff;
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the farenheight, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullethole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rought like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a saviour
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin
The main idea in here for the hemisphere
CL's here to get wreck for the year

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Prepare yourself to catch a verse from the big purse 
Rotate the megahertz  where you heard it first 
The perpendicular  said none similar 
Quadruple any figure  quick on the trigger 

Helter skelter  wig out by the goodfella 
Not Lou Pinella 'cause I'm black and mo' betta 
Bust a phenomenum  we come to get busy 
Deep in roots  but my name ain't Kizzie 

Many many march 'cause I'm heavy on the starch 
Never tell a farce when I scale on a arch 
Jammin' on the radio, brothers say, ""way to go"" 
Shape it like Play-Do, soprano at the Chateau 

My theory periodically flows a odyssey 
Bigger than modern technology 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that... 

C.L. is the attribute you salute 
'Cause I gotta make loot, can't afford to be cute 
Enter the equilibrium in a medium 
Breaking your cranium with no ultimatum 

Drop a psalm like a bomb, never land in your palm 
And now I'm so cool and calm 
Pure unadulterated, premeditated 
Lyrical form, Pete Rock is the storm 

Sophistication I kick to a nation 
I rare compilation I call recreation 
The prognosis, so mackadocious 
Straight up ferocious for those who can focus 

Large like the Beatles, ask all my peoples 
Never make movies, so don't talk sequels 
So, hon, save the chit-chat when I kick a format fat (it's fat) 
It's like that... 

I'm all sold out, no doubt, without a question 
The blessing your guests in a suprucated session 
Anyway your honor, heresay the melee 
Is here for the payday, so A to the K 

Or should I say Deda, original baby par 
Smooth like a reservoir, the funky Shang-Ri-La 
No shame in my game, I'm set to entertain 
And if it wasn't for the fame, skinz would never know my name 

So back off a tad bit, that's a bad habit 
'Cause I write the raw...for sure 
Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile 
Never fragile 'cause I'm flowin' like the Nile 

Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them 
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach 
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger 
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker 

So here's to another hit, perfectly legitimate 
When I hit the skinz, guaranteed to keep the candle lit 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that...",It's Like That

What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it's loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca wanna bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I'm about to hit the skinz

Talkin bout the skinz

That's right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C'mon

Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah

Nowadays I'm on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)'ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it's hard like Charles Bronson
It's kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won't hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
Cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who's the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she'll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won't be the Post
After that you know the flavor I'm ghost!

That's right, be out
Hit it off on the skinz

C'mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they're forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
But never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won't curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
Sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I'm with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
Cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
Til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I'm out

Like the Isley's, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it's OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh
It's fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don't try to show
Because I'm, the accurate man
Everybody knows it

Hons always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell em, ""Papes,"" I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say (""Mmm I got them"")
Oppressed on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
CL doesn't scratch, so I won't leave you itchin
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1

I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bad

The finesse I posess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation

We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon

Walk the fine, short line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Show-lin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one to five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?) straighten it out
That's right y'all straighten it out (say what?)
You got to straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out yeah
Straighten it out it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, where the Troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bass line's critical
Better than the original who first made it
But now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, seeya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
C'mon (say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out you got to
Straighten it out c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must straighten it out
Say what?

Everybody must straighten it out
The YG's, they must straighten it out
The Hilltop, they muststraighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honies dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon ya'll

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City",Carmel City
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell
While I bid you all a farewell",Check It Out
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stocks to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest to make lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your head frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's life, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Peep the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name now that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism

Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cras and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarsarate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Veronville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I

Ladies and gentlemen for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Collesseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing lovin'
Tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days

Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can faze me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30

Doin' trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, livin' well
And never cease to flip the hottest dime piece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slippin off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop fakin' me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dime pieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinkin totally nude with no limits
Goin' through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showin' nothin' but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from

Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin' in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin' this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in queens
The veronville's my capital, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Check it, grap luva, if you're in the house
Just get on the mic and show 'em what it's all about

It's all about the wicked check one two
Cause I rips a microphone and pass it to my crew
I don't drink no brew, I smoke nuff spliffs, I don't have no riffs
So check me as I shoot the gift
Rip rhymes, freestyle rhymes
Off top of the dome every time
I'm glad this shit is going on tape
So I can escape into the beat and make nuff papes
Word to god, kicking nuff freestyle rhymes",It's on You

Feel the funk by the rap czars in sports cars
Comin atcha now you listen at the feet of a master
Caution, not Wheel of Fortune, here's a portion
Of untamedness, approachin famous, for miscellaneous
The track get crackin though, unexplainable
When I ground a jewel, sound is simply uncontainable
Release my soul, but never make the mistake
And play me like a stone cold fruitcake man
Cause you can never fathom G the dough we want so
My flow's the steadiest, to never leave us penniless
Come on down to the very necessary legendary
Well the more the merry stickin women type of villian
The evidence relentless, I ride to see you magnatized
Mecca to begin you're locked in no doubt
The label better push this, so we can pay the rent
You can season the pot well, but here's The Main Ingredient

I know you wonder what kind of way is that to think:
Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient
Hit the third verse off kid

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield
When dynamite's my rhythm this is East coast terrorism
The Vernon-ville's Mecca Don, formin Voltron tactics
Let off three verses and the crowd panics
Get em all, the kingpin of the Player's Ball
Now every tramp in your camp's going AWOL
My Lucci situation is A Daily Operation
On the strip, I refine you like Tales From the Crypt
Right here's the real shit, and all that other's counterfeit
Funk to let you know exactly what you're dealin with
P-R slash, C-L smash, love to spend cash
For proper livin, slidin up in wealthy women
Stick your hand in my pants, and grab the mic's no crime

For you to respect my whole foundation precisely

Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away

You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering

Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back

We up ten, but need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars

A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece

Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays

Ahh yeah 
Back again with another hit smash 
Pete Rock and CL Smooth 

We got the groove for you 
So go call your crew 
And let em know we in the house 
CL hit em off with the verses 

Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother 
With the Mecca Don Workin' brunette to blonde 
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black 
with us havin' the Vernon Villians back to back 

Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase 
For real it's long overdue, so I don't want to talk to you 
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted 
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted 

I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way 
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA 
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy 
to the lady, none of this is make-believe 

I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century 
Battle physically, conquer mentally 
Essentially, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, why'know, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]
C... L... what you gonna do 
You... know... you can make me Boo 
Over... and over again 
Come on, and take me there 

Control now so in the future see me callin' the shots 
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics 
I'm blowin' up spots for knots in the millennium years 
And now I drop it on my peers, brings Tears and Fears 

And now the question manifest in my only 
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue 
That brings a world of intrigue and glamor to my arsenal 
of Gods, pimps to players and layers of Deceptions 

My whole mindstate gravitate to weapon 
Makin people in the business get a misconception 
It ain't hard to the core, it ain't Sex on the Beach 
It's just another plateau the brothers have to reach 

Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided 
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided 
No question, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame 
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game 
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay 
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away 

Chose for Negroes, the most hypnotical flows 
on the planet, another East coast track rose, God dammit 
My theme, to mainstream's the knocker 
Only time I get right as block is when my lucci's on lock 

Pretty much I'm comin through in the clutch see 
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel 
Or is it just my style of hustle makin a mark 
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park 

It was dark, when I brought it to the light, despite 
my staff's got me takin nothin but champagne baths 
Now the aftermath's dealin with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus] 

Just come on 
Take me right where I want to be 
Come on 
Come on to you and me 

Come on 
Ohhh 

Keep doin' it baby 
Check it out, bust it

Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real",Tell Me

Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price

Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Stay down, I don't think I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it

That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it

But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, there's two religions
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, you're the God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I play your shit out like ??? cause my wig out has to hit
I'm steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator

Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings

Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

As grains of sand pass from hand to hand
I watch time stand still I`m just one man
That`s out for all so all should be for one
Grew up on the drum with the J.B. ""Unh!""
The son, who spun the record that his pop`s collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family ""Get down!""
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It`s all love now, let me show you how
to take time out, and show you what life`s about

Chorus: Jane Eugene and Carl McIntosh
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Wo oh just a mattter of time

[Jane Eugene]
Feel the flow, and let it go
Unwind, relax your mind
Stay a while, take your time
Bet you`ll find, peace of mind

[Pete Rock]
With a, douse of soul, I`m back in control
My goal sees the world pass from young to old
Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale
2000 the year my black people prevail
Yo straight up and down I got love for this son
Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I`ll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

Chorus 4X",Take Your Time
Pete Rugolo,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura
Pete Rugolo,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Pete Rugolo,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

Pete Rugolo,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,

Pete Seeger,"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning

So come with me, we'll go and see

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
And the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around it
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work

Shot her man, he was doin' her wro

Now bring out your rubber tired hearses
Bring out your rubber tired hack
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard
But only six of 'em called him back
He was my man but he done me wrong.

Bring round a thousand policemen
Bring 'em around today
To lock me down in that dungeon cell
And throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doin' me wrong.

What are they goin' to do

It's the electric chair for you
You shot your man, he was doin' you wrong.

What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

I've sung this song, but I'll sing it again
Of the people I've met and the places I've seen
Some of the troubles that bothered my mind
And a lot of good people that I've left behind, singing

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home

They hugged and they kissed in that dusty old dark
They sighed and they cried and they hugged and they kissed
But instead of marriage they talked like this: honey

I went to your family and asked them for you
They all said take her, oh take please do
She can't cook or so and she won't't scrub your floor
So I put on my coat, tip toed down the door, singing

What a long time since I've been home

I walked down the street to the grocery store
It was crowded with people both rich and both poor
I asked the man how his butter was sold
He says one pound of butter for two pounds of gold, I said

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
What a long time since I've been home
And I've gotta be driftin' along

My telephone rang and it jumped off the wall
That was the preacher makin' his call
He said, ""we're waiting to tie the knot
You're getting married believe it or not""

The church was jammed and the church was packed
The pews were crowded from the front to the back
A thousand of friends waiting to kiss my new bride
But I was so anxious I rushed her outside, told her

So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya
So long, it's been good to know ya

Pete Seeger,"I was down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I.
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo.
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few.
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.
And back through the glen
I rode again.
And my heart with grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more.
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you.
For slavery fled the glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew.",The Foggy Dew

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

[Chorus]

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",The Ballad of Ira Hayes

Pete Seeger,"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

""Why 
They're singing! 
They're singing about ME!"" 
And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

Pete Seeger,"On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting late
Young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hate
And Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks
For one man is no army when the city turns its back

Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight
Death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long
For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall
And shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all",Lou Marsh

Pete Seeger,"Walking down death row,
I sang for three men destined for the chair;
Walking down death row,
I sang of lives and loves in other years.
Walking down death row, I sang of hopes that used to be.
Through the bars, into each separate cell,
Yes, I sang to one and two and three.
""If you'd only only stuck together you'd not be sitting here!
""If you could have loved each other's lives, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I turned the corner and found to my surprise;
There were women there as well,
With babies in their arms, before my eyes.
Walking down death row,
I tried once more to sing of hopes that used to be.
But the thought of that contraption, down the hall,
Waiting for whole families, one dozen, two or three,
""If you'd only stuck together, you'd not be here!
""If you could've loved another's child as well as your own, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I concentrated, singing to the young.
I sang of hopes that flickered still,
I tried to mouth their many separate tongues.
Walking down death row,
I sang of life and love that still might be.
Singing down death row,
To each separate human cell, One billion, two, or three,
""If we'd only stick together, we'd not be here!
""If we could learn to love each other's lives, we'd not be sitting here!

Still I love it and I'll keep the dream
That some day, though maybe not this year
My Hudson River will once again run clear

It starts high in the mountains of the north
Crystal clear and icy trickles forth
With just a few floating wrappers of chewing gum
Dropped by some hikers to warn of things to come

At Glens Falls, five thousand honest hands
Work at the consolidated paper plant
Five million gallons of waste a day
Why should we do it any other way?

Down the valley one million toilet chains
Find my Hudson so convenient place to drain
And each little city says, ""Who, me?
Do you think that sewage plants come free?""

Out in the ocean they say the water's clear
But I live right at Beacon here
Half way between the mountains and sea
Tacking to and fro, this thought returns to me

I'll tell you a story of somebody's town.
It isn't too near and it's not far away.
It's not a place where I'd want to stay.

[Chorus:]
Now the people are scratching all over the street
Because the rabbits had nothing to eat.

The winter came in with a cold icy blast.
It killed off the flowers and killed off the grass.
The rabbits were starving because of the freeze.
They started eating the bark off the trees.

[Chorus]

The farmers said, ""This sort of thing just won't do.
Our trees will be dead when the rabbits get through.
We'll have to poison the rabbits, it's clear;
Or we'll have no crops to harvest next year.""

[Chorus]

So they brought the poison and spread it around.
And soon dead rabbits began to be found.
Dogs ate the rabbits and the farmers just said,
""We'll poison those rabbits 'til the last dog is dead.""

[Chorus]

Up in the sky there were meat-eating fowls.
The dead rabbits poisoned the hawks and the owls.
Thousands of field mice the hawks used to chase
Were multiplying all over the place.

[Chorus]

The fields and the meadows were barren and brown.
The mice got hungry and moved into town.
The city folks took the farmer's advise
And all of them started to poison the mice.

[Chorus]

There were dead mice in all the apartments and flats.
The cats ate the mice and the mice killed the cats.
The smell was awful and I'm glad to say
I wasn't the man hired to haul them away.

[Chorus]

All through the country and all through the town
There wasn't a dog or cat to be found.
The fleas asked each other, ""Where can we stay?""
They've been on the people from then 'til this day.

[Chorus]

Stay clear of the man with the poisonous hand!
A few bails of hay might keep you alive
But he'll pay more to kill you than let you survive.

Pete Seeger,"My name is Lisa Kalvelage, I was born in Nuremberg
And when the trials were held there nineteen years ago
It seemed to me ridiculous to hold a nation all to blame
For the horrors that the world did undergo
A short while later when I applied to be a G. I. bride
An American consular official questioned me
He refused my exit permit, said my answers did not show
I'd learned my lesson about responsibility.

Thus suddenly I was forced to start thinking on this theme
And when later I was permitted to emigrate
I must have been asked a hundred times where I was and what I did
In those years when Hitler ruled our state
I said I was a child or at most a teen-ager
But that only extended the questioning
They'd ask, where were my parents, my father, my mother
And to this I could answer not a thing.

The seed planted there at Nuremberg in 1947
Started to sprout and to grow
Gradually I understood what that verdict meant to me
When there are crimes that I can see and I can know
And now I also know what it is to be charged with mass guilt
Once in a lifetime is enough for me
No, I could not take it for a second time
And that is why I am here today.

The events of May 25th, the day of our protest,
Put a small balance weight on the other side
Hopefully, someday my contribution to peace
Will help just a bit to turn the tide
And perhaps I can tell my children six
And later on their own children
That at least in the future they need not be silent
When they are asked, ""Where was your mother, when?""",My Name Is Liza Kalvelage

Pete Seeger,"It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Louisiana,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?""
""Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground.""
We were, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim.""
""Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,""
The Captain said to him.
""All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on.""
We were, neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, ""Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on.""
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral,
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Pete Seeger,"o to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby

Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

So go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Don't you feel the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby",Hobo's Lullaby

Old devil time, you'd like to bring me down

You thought I'd cry and beg you for the end

Sailng down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone

Life for all my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home

Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
And I was never alone

Exploring all the little byways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home

Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Yet I was never alone
And I was not far from home

Pete Seeger,"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen

Cry the grim bells of Blaina

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I could have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all.

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you, right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way.

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Both Sides Now
Pete Seeger,"I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know

Oh her hair was dark and curly
And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I'll run away with thee

No I'll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best

The ocean's deep and I can't wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I'll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o'er the tide

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone

I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you my darling
Say you'll take me back again

At my door you're welcome in
At my gate I'll always greet you
For you're the girl I tried to win",East Virginia Blues
Pete Seeger,"Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Well, a hundred men went down in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore.

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats and waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they're telling of the fight.
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James.",Sinking of the Reuben James

Pete Seeger,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans

Please keep them safe below

Find my way in nature's chain
Till my body and my brain
Tell the music of the land

Season with a prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care

On my tomato plants

The kitchen's chocked with zucchinis

He's got his hungry eye on me
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there

Pete Seeger,"Come and listen to my story, come and listen to my song. 
I'll tell you of a hero, he's now dead and gone
He was the bravest union boy that I have ever seen
Expecting to be shot on site, or taken for a ride 
By them dirty coal operators
A'shootin down the union men wherever they were found
Gave his life in struggle
That was all that he could do 
He died for the union, 
Also for me and you.",Harry Simms
Pete Seeger,"When I was a little girl I wished I was a boy
I tagged along behind the gang and wore my corduroys.
Everybody said I only did it to annoy
But I was gonna be an engineer.

Mamma said, ""Why can't you be a lady?
Your duty is to make me the mother of a pearl
Wait until you're older, dear
And maybe you'll be glad that you're a girl.

Dainty as a Dresden statue, gentle as a Jersey cow,
Smooth as silk, gives cream and milk
Learn to coo, learn to moo
That's what you do to be a lady, now.

When I went to school I learned to write and how to read
History, geography and home economy
And typing is a skill that every girl is sure to need
To while away the extra time until the time to breed
And then they had the nerve to ask, what would I like to be?
I says, ""I'm gonna be an engineer!""

""No, you only need to learn to be a lady
The duty isn't yours, for to try to run the world
An engineer could never have a baby
Remember, dear, that you're a girl""

She's smart, for a woman.
I wonder how she got that way?
You get no choice, you get no voice
Just stay mum, pretend you're dumb.
That's how you come to be a lady, today.

Well, I started as a typist but I studied on the sly
Working out the day and night so I could qualify
And every time the boss came in, he pinched me on the thigh
Said, ""I've never had an engineer!""
""You owe it to the job to be a lady
The duty of the staff is to give the boss a whirl
The wages that you get are crummy, maybe
But it's all you get, 'cause you're a girl""

Then Jimmy came along and we set up a conjugation
We were busy every night with loving recreation
I spent my days at work so he could get an education
And now he's an engineer!

He said: ""I know you'll always be a lady
The duty of my darling is to love me all her life
Could an engineer look after or obey me?
Remember, dear, that you're my wife!""

As soon a Jimmy got a job, I studied hard again
Then busy at me turret-lathe a year or two, and then
The morning that the twins were born, Jimmy says to them
""Your mother was an engineer!""
""You owe it to the kids to be a lady
Dainty as a dish-rag, faithful as a chow
Stay at home, you got to mind the baby
Remember you're a mother now!""

Every time I turn around there's something else to do
Cook a meal or mend a sock or sweep a floor or two
Listening to Jimmy Young, it makes me want to spew
I was gonna be an engineer.

I only wish that I could be a lady
I'd do the lovely things that a lady's supposed to do
I wouldn't even mind if only they would pay me
Then I could be a person too.

What price for a woman?
You can buy her for a ring of gold,
To love and obey, without any pay,
You get a cook and a nurse for better or worse
You don't need a purse when a lady is sold.

Oh, but now the times are harder and me Jimmy's got the sack;
I went down to Vicker's, they were glad to have me back.
But I'm a third-class citizen, my wages tell me that
But I'm a first-class engineer!

The boss he says ""We pay you as a lady,
You only got the job because I can't afford a man,
With you I keep the profits high as may be,
You're just a cheaper pair of hands.""

You got one fault, you're a woman
You're not worth the equal pay.
A bitch or a tart, you're nothing but heart,
Shallow and vain, you've got no brain,

Well, I listened to my mother and I joined a typing pool
Listened to my lover and I put him through his school
If I listen to the boss, I'm just a bloody fool
And an underpaid engineer
I been a sucker ever since I was a baby
As a daughter, as a mother, as a lover, as a dear
But I'll fight them as a woman, not a lady
I'll fight them as an engineer!",I'm Gonna Be an Engineer
Pete Seeger,"First you get the buckets ready, clean the pans and gather firewood,
Late in the winter, it's maple syrup time.
You need warm and sunny days but still a cold and freezing nighttime
For just a few weeks, maple syrup time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long,
Till ninety seven percent of water evaporates just like this song
And when what is left is syrupy don't leave it too long
Watch out for burning! Maple syrup time.

I know it's not the quickest system but each year I can't resist it.
Get out the buckets, and tap the trees in time
Making it is half the fun, and satisfaction when it's done.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.
My grandpa says perhaps it's just a waste of time.
Ah! but no more than this attempt to make a happy little rhyme,
So pat your feet or swing your tail, but keep in good time.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

I'll send this song around the world with love to every boy and girl,
Hoping they don't mind a little advice in rhyme.
As in life or revolution, rarely is there a quick solution,
Anything worthwhile takes a little time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long.
When what is left is syrupy, don't leave it on the flame too long.
But seize the minute, build a new world, sing an old song.

Pete Seeger,"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The mountain stands beside the sea.
This world we know turns round and round,
And all for them - and you and me.",The Water Is Wide

All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
Moon rolls through the nighttime
Till daybreak comes around
All my life's a circle
Still I wonder why
Seasons spinning 'round again
Years keep rolling by

Seems like I've been here before
Can't remember when
I got this funny feeling
We'll all be together again
No straight lines make up my life
All my roads have bends
No clear cut beginnings
So far no dead ends

I've met you a thousand times
I guess you've done the same
Then we lose each other

Our love is like a circle
Let's go 'round one more time

Pete Seeger,"My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation.
I hear the real, thought far off hymn
That hails the new creation
Above the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

What through the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it live'th.
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it give'th.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging.
When friends by shame are undefiled,
How can I keep from singing?",How Can I Keep from Singing?

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I can even glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today

CHORUS:
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am going down to Washington D.C.
I will tell some power broker
What they did for Iacocca
Will be perfectly acceptable to me
I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am headed for that great receiving line
So when they hand a million grand out
I'll be standing with my hand out
Yes sire I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go
They won't have to scream and holler
They'll be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow
I'll be glad to tell them what they can do
It's a matter of a simple form or two
It's not just renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

CHORUS

Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems that there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down to congress there's a safety net for you

Pete Seeger,"If I should die before I wake,
All my bone and sinew take
Put me in the compost pile
To decompose me for a while.

Worms, water, sun will have their way,
Returning me to common clay
All that I am will feed the trees
And little fishes in the seas.

When radishes and corn you munch,
You may be having me for lunch
And then excrete me with a grin,
Chortling, ""There goes Lee again.""

'Twill be my happiest destiny
To die and live eternally.

Looked into your eyes this morning
You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found

And grace my fears relieved
Oh, how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Shall I be wafted to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others strive to win the prize
And sail on bloody seas

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Pete Seeger,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union
Pete Seeger,"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

And then, oh lord, I gave him my hand

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

I worked my day hard and so did my wife
Workin' hand-in-hand to make a good life
With corn in the field and wheat in the bins
Then, oh lord, I was the father of twins

Oh

Our children numbered just about four
They all had a sweetheart knockin' on the door
They all got married and they didn't hesitate
I was, oh lord, the grandfather of eight

Oh kisses sweeter than wine

Now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
We had a lot of kids, trouble and pain
But, oh lord, we'd do it all again


Oh kisses sweeter than wine
Oh kisses sweeter than wine

Oh",Kisses Sweeter Than Wine
Pete Seeger,"[Chorus]
One blue sky above us
One ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round
Who could ask for more
And because I love you
I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race
It's too soon to die.

Some folks want to be like an ostrich,
Bury their heads in the sand.
Some hope that plastic dreams
Can unclench all those greedy hands.
Some hope to take the easy way:
Poisons, bombs. They think we need 'em.
Don't you know you can't kill all the unbelievers?
There's no shortcut to freedom.

Go tell, go tell all the little children.
Tell all the mothers and fathers too.
Now's our last chance to learn to share
What's been given to me and you.

Knew the train would roll that day, but I did not know what time.

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time.
Knew the train would roll that day but I did not know what time.

Good morning Mister Railroad Man, what time does your train roll by?

Who should I spy but a fair young maiden

""Oh no kind sir,"" she quickly answered,
""I choose to lead a sweet single life.""
""What makes you different from other women?
What makes you different from other kind?
For you are young, sweet, beautiful and handsome,
And for to marry you, I might incline.""

I might have been married three years ago
To one John Riley who left this country.
He's been the cause of my overthrow.""

He courted me both night and day.
And when he had once my affections gained,
He left me here and he went away.""

Why, we'll sail o'er to Pennsylvany,

Or go with you to the distant shore.

He gave her kisses one, two, and three,

Pete Seeger,"Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo

Once upon a time there was a little boy who
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""

Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make
Things disappear. But the father played too
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass
Disappears, He'd come to someone about
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son!"" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat, people, up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:

Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
(Oh, you sing it with me,)",Abiyoyo

Aimee McPherson, that wonderful person,
She weight a hundred eighty and her hair was red
And preached a wicked sermon, so the papers said.

[Chorus]
Hi dee hi dee hi dee hi
Ho dee ho dee ho dee ho.

Aimee built herself a radio station
To broadcast her preaching to the nation.
She found a man named Armistead who knew enough
To run the radio while Aimee did her stuff.

She held a camp meeting out at Ocean Park
Preached from early morning 'til after dark.
Said the benediction, folded up her tent,
And nobody knew where Aimee went.

When Aimee McPherson got back from this journey,
She told her tale to the district attorney.
Said she'd been kidnapped on a lonely trail.
In spite of all the questions, she stuck to her tale.

Well, the Grand Jury started an investigation,
Uncovered a lot of spicy information.
Found out about a love nest down at Carmel-by-the-Sea,
Where the liquor was expensive and the loving was free.

They found a cottage with a breakfast nook,
A folding bed with a worn-out look.
The slats were busted and the springs were loose,
And the dents in the mattress fitted Aimee's caboose.

Well they took poor Aimee and they threw her in jail.
Last I heard she was out on bail.
They'll send her up for a stretch, I guess,
She worked herself up into an awful mess

Now Radio Ray is a going hound;
He's going yet and he ain't been found.
They got his description, but they got it too late.
Sin they got it, he's lost a lot of weight.

Now I'll end my story in the usual way,
About this lady preacher's holiday.
If you don't get the moral then you're the gal for me
'Cause they got a lot of cottages down at Carmel-by-the-Sea.",Aimee Semple Mcpherson

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

Old age is golden so I've heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
With my ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up.
As sleep dims my vision I say to myself:
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But though nations are warring and business is vexed
I'll stick around to see what happens next.

I could kick up my heels right over my head.
When I was older my slippers were blue,
But still I could dance the whole night thru.

But never you laugh; I don't mind at all,
I'd rather be huffing than not puff at all.

I will tell you of a young boy, whose age was nineteen
He was the bravest union man, that I have ever seen

Harry Simms was a palomine, we labored side by side
Expecting to be shot on sight, or taken for a ride
By them dirty cold operator gun thugs, that roamed from town to town
A-shooting down the union men, where e'er they may be found

Harry Simms was walkin' down the track, one bright sun-shiney day
He was a youth of courage, his step was light and gay
He did not know the gun thugs was hiding on the way
To kill our brave young comrade this bright sun-shiney day

Harry Simms was killed on Brush Creek, in nineteen thirty-two
He organized the miners, into the N.M.U.
He gave his life in struggle, that was all that he could do
He died for the union, also for me and you",Harry Sims

Pete Seeger,"When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip,
I wanted some place to call my own.
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,
And settled down along the Cimarron.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home, it blowed away.
It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,
But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away.

I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And got a fancy mortgage on the place.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
All the crops I planted blowed away.
You can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain;
All except the mortgage blowed away.

It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,
I figured I was all set for life.
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife.

She blowed away, she blowed away
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.
Mister as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack;
So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
A-travelin' with the wind at my back.

I blowed away, I blowed away
Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.
Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
My Oklahoma farm is overhead.

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'
I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
My Oklahoma home that blowed away.

I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;
My Oklahoma home is in the sky.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My farm down upon the Cimarron.
But all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,
Some is from my Oklahoma home.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.

Pete Seeger,"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd
Pete Seeger,"When Great Grandfather was a gay young man
And Great Grandmother was his bride
They found a lot, a jolly little spot
Over on the old North Side
It sloped down toward the river, from River Avenue
Great Grandma said that it would give her
Such a lovely view
So they took a look in Godey's Ladies Book
To see what they could find
And they found a house, a jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandfather was a handy man
Who never wasted any time
He found a crew that knew just what to do
With white pine, common brick, and lime.
He said, ""I'll build a big veranda, where Amanda can perch.
""And I'll sit there myself on Sunday mornings
""When everybody else has gone to church.""
The neighbors said, ""He's crazy in the head
""He's surely lost his mind.""
But he built that house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandpa at last was laid to rest
With Great Grandmother at his side.
Old Aunt Amanda said, ""My land, an
""Empty house I can't abide.
""I'll start a ladies' seminary, it will be very select.
""Of course, it will be very necessary
""That all my girls be circumspect.""
As you may guess, it was a big success
Those girls were so refined
In that self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Aunt Amanda's work at last was done
And she passed on to her reward.
Appeared a sign that bore the line
Announcing simply, ""Room and Board.""
The house was soon filled with roomers, of every degree
Red flannel underwear and bloomers
Hung out for everyone to see.
The old porch stoop had started in to droop
The house looked so resigned
That self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now that old house was looking worse and worse
And so was River Avenue.
Wooden shacks across the tracks
Spoiled Great Grandma's lovely view.
A group of very pretty ladies moved in there one day.
The were such pretty Sues and Sadies
But a wagon came and took them all away.
Said one old dame, ""Now isn't it a shame
""My girls were so refined.""
But they closed that house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.",Queen Anne Front

Susanna, don't you cry

Oh, Susanna,
Oh don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee

I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
A-coming down the hill

The buckwheat cake
Was in her mouth
The tear was
In her eye
Says I, I'm coming from the south
Susanna, don't you cry

Oh, Susanna,
Oh don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee","Oh, Susannah"

Comin' for to carry me home,
A band of angels comin' after me,
Comin' for to carry me home.

Comin' for to carry me home,
Tell all my friends I'm comin' too,

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones

Pete Seeger,"You know the guitar came to Europe with the gypsies 700 years ago
Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I die just bury me deep
Down at the foot of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times do I crave
Place the tombstone at my head and my feet
Tell my friends that I've gone to sleep

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

Pete Seeger,"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen [*]
Pete Seeger,"[Chorus]
This land is your land,
This land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway,
I saw below me that golden valley,
This land was made for you and me.

I roamed and I rambled, and I followed my footsteps
To the sparking sands of her diamond deserts,
All around me a voice was sounding,
This land was made for you and me.

When the sun came shining, then I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,
A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,
This land was made for you and me.

One bright sunny morning, in the shadow of the steeple,
By the relief office I saw my people,
As they stood there hungry, I stood there wondering if,
This land was made for you and me.

Was a big high wall there that tried to stop me,
Was a great big sign that said, ""Private Property,""
But on the other side, it didn't say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.

Nobody living can ever stop me,
As I go walking my freedom highway,
Nobody living can make me turn back,
This land was made for you and me.

Maybe you've been working as hard as you're able,
But you've just got crumbs from the rich man's table,
And maybe you're thinking, was it truth or fable,
That this land was made for you and me.

Woodland and grassland and river shoreline,
To everything living, even little microbes,
Fin, fur, and feather, we're all here together,
This land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, but it once was my land,
Until we sold you Manhattan Island.
You pushed our Nations to the reservations,
This land was stole by you from me",This Land Is Your Land [*]

Irene goodnight,
Irene goodnight.
Goodnight, Irene, goodnight, Irene,
I'll see you in my dreams.

Sometimes I live in the country,
Sometimes I live in town.
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump into the river and drown.

I asked your mother for you,
She told me you was too young.
I wish to God I'd never seen your face,
I'm sorry you ever was born.

You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn,
You caused me to leave my home.
But the very last words I heard her say,
Was please sing me one more song.","Goodnight, Irene [Irene, Goodnight]"

So drunk that he could not see.

Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me.""

The tears running down from his eyes.
He said, ""I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my six-shooters never told a lie,
No, my six-shooters never told a lie.

Was a little girl dressed in blue.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I've been true to you.
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you.""
The next one to visit John Hardy in his cell,
Was a little girl dressed in red.
She came down to that old jail cell,
She said, ""Johnny, I had rather see you dead,
Well, Johnny, I had rather see you dead.""

I've never been in love before
At least not in this kind
I've seldom felt such happiness
But if I am really in love then
Why is it me because
I didn't think that I was your kind
Not good enough for your love

You see the shape I know I'm in
With only you to blame
Oh maxine
The life I led is long since dead
I do myself resign

Pete Shelley,"I met a good man
He had some good stuff
He showed me a bag
And he pulled out the snuff
I had just one try
And that was enough
Water poured from my eye
God stuff this rough snuff

I was wiping my eye
On the edge of my sleeve
When who did I spy?
God damn the police!
I said ""hey look man the fuzz!""
He turned ghostly white
He gave me the bag
And ran outasight!

I leapt on my hog
And I burned up the street
All the traffic had to stop
'cause I couldn't be beat
All the people were scared
As they leapt from my wheels
But I didn't care
I couldn't hear their squeals

I went to my pad
And I crashed on my bed
I kept taking that snuff
Until it blew my head
It was really gunpowder
I a flash in the pan
I a charcoaled cinder

Pete Shelley,"Have you seen them in the skies?
I've been searching for the things I cannot hide
Wishes for me
Wishes for you
Would it makes us happy if our wishes all came true?
Will I ever find the answer
To the questions that I ask myself sometimes?
Is there a reason or is that just in my mind?
Why am I here ?
Why are you there?

Are we all that different that there's nothing we can share?
Will I ever find the answer?
Is there even an answer?

Is there anybody out there?

Do we really have a soul?

Is there a heaven?
Do you believe all that you're told?
Salvation for you
Damnation for me
Is this all that there is or are there things that we can't see?
Maybe meditation could improve my concentration
I need an indication to establish a relation

Reflecting on the past
The shattered hopes and dreams of a future
That was never meant to last

Tell me what you see
Look all around you
Is this how things could be

But now I know it never will
Hanging around on the off chance
Waiting for that certain thrill

It's getting late now

I wonder how I'd feel
If ever I should be so enchanted
To get a taste of what is real

I feel the sound of thunder and laughter
It's tearing me apart

Hoping for some nice advice that only you could bring
But you came as in a storm when the woolly dreams were shorn off my back
Suffer cold reality's sting

Now I've seen it slip away and tomorrow's just another day
To find relief from feeling sad

Yesterday's not here no more
It's gone for good and I'm glad 'cause it made me sore

Who knows who cares now

You had changed your mind
Now I guess that it's
All up to you
Am I just today another one
That you've left behind
Or did you love me
With a love so true

I thought you and I were friends
Still you made me cry
What else can I do
'N' maybe love will find a way
Give me one more try
It's all up to you

How can you tell me that I must be dreaming
You're waiting around I've got nothing to do
So tired of waiting I've only one lifetime

Another lonely lifetime
Until it drags you down

Looking the other way

Before we drag it down
It's not too late to resolve the old solution
And then we'll drag it down

Feel that I might as well give up and go

All the day is the night
But somehow I just can't sleep
Somehow though it don't seem right
I had you but love didn't keep

What was heaven without you babe
Now everything is complete
I sometimes wish it's a novel
And I'd see you in the street

Sometimes I hear your voice
Echoing it makes me cry

And I just can't get to sleep
Sorting out my thoughts
But I don't know which are the right ones to keep
Thinking of the countries
Where there's nothing left to eat
Counting the starving millions by the thousand

Why I should even raise a smile

They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time could be for ever

The things I say may very well sound different
Depending on your point of view
Some kind of lovers give you creature comforts
Do anything you want them to
Somebody told me they thought I was much older
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time should be for ever

Never again I hear somebody saying
Will you break this heart of mine
But I can't wait not even for a moment
I'm drifting off the edge of time
You showed me things that should remain a mystery
Just like they were intended to
If I try hard and do some rearranging
I could find a place for you

You say you know but you might be mistaken
Taken for a ride again
Alone at last but this is not the first time
I hope it won't turn out the same
Somebody told me they never ever worried
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time will last for ever

Never again I hear somebody saying

Hold me close closer than the last time

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Makes me stop before I begin

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

By the hand of a man, whose name was Dan, Dan the blacksmith

Well once I was a sword, many years ago
And my blade was broad, many years ago
Wore it with pride, and into battle I'd ride, on a warrior side
And cut my tail, their was loss of my tail
And soon did rust, corrode to dust, oh my

Well once I was a daisy, many years ago
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago
But I was met by a goat who fell in a moat
And forgetting to float he sunk like a lead and stayed until dead
And was relieved to find just how kind it all was

Well once I was a grub, many years ago
And I lived among that mud , many years ago
But I'm a reckless mood, and I gave it a Coo
That was it with a prune, and when the good Lord was done
I walked with the sun, I shed my skins
And tried my wings and flew away

Well, once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival
And once I was a carp and lived in waters on the meadow
And once I was a mynah bird, quoting verses from the Bible
I said pretty boy, pretty boy, Saint Luke

Well once I was a mule, many years ago
And my master treat me cruel, many years ago
By by was sick, so I moved to a kick, 
So I took out a stick , laid it back across my back
To an almighty crack to my dismay
I cast away into the blue

Then I was born a human baby, many years ago
I remember I was born unto a lady, many years ago
All our hopes were piled on the back of a child
Who turned out to be wild, sent the devil a prayer
Caused the parson to swear so I took my leave
To lie and thieve, on my way to jail

Well, I've been a tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor
Known good times and disaster
But now I have a teacher and my teacher has a master
And the master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster
Don't need no proof, 'cause that's the truth, and I'll drink to that!",Evolution
Pete Townshend,"And nothing sure is forever
When forever's no time at all
As I lie amongst the heather bed
High above the ocean's roar

I seem to hear my name being called
Yet who am I waiting for
And I love the lover who loves with
All the love he has and more

And now that the summer's ending
And your baby cries out to sea
I do feel that I am drowning
In the love that you're sending me

The glass sets up a sound like people laughing
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing

Mmm.
I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

Find it, I got to hear it all again...
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greed's

But if you never have pleasure then you could be dead

Pete Townshend,"They say that love often passes in a second
And you can never catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckon
But it's clear that the match is rough
Common sense's tell me not to try'n continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love is so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
Just a little is enough

I'm like a connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line that's true
But all I have to have's a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feel like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other track
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense's tell me not to try'n continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open

Pete Townshend,"I stood at the door beside her
But she wouldn't let me pass
I was such a bore, and I lied to her
I said I didn't really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slain, but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last

And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in Hell
And on the forecourt I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought, hey

Somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me

You would have thought that I'd have learned
Twenty years ago or more
A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned
But I didn't know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain
The weather here is never too bright
She'd had an affray with her man and came
For solace and the means to fight

She finally bored with seducing me
And took up with some geezer from the Ealing scene
It nearly killed him like it would've killed me
When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed, she obeyed

But somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever

I don't know about guardian angels
All I know about's staying alive
I can't shout about spiritual labels
When little ones die and big ones thrive

All I know is that I've been making it
And there've been times that I didn't deserve to
Every show there's been more faking it
But right at the point of no return

Somebody saves me again and again
Somebody saves me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saves me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I blew it for a single moment
I'd blow it forever
But somebody saves me

I took up the connection once
Made me feel quite aloof
I never could queue to collect my lunch
While I was pursuing the truth
So I left my folks in the mud and rain
It always rains in Sunnyside Road
I lived hippy jokes, getting stoned insane
Till the rain looked just like snow

But there was a soul in whom I could depend
He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed
I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then
And when I finally woke up clean
My friend was dead, stone dead

Somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me - I ain't ready for Heaven
'Cause if I'd seen you for a second, I'd have wanted to see you forever

I twist my vacuum flask and have a cup of tea

Goin' fishin' never catch none
If I did, I'd surely lance
The spirit of the first is quiggley
The fish tackle scares me and the snails

The pleasure cruiser's speed
Laden with wind cheaters
The hooters blow and seize
My mind from nature's creatures

Blowing the fish, emptying in my warm hand
I want fishin' everlasting
You can take my son if you drown your own daughter

Watch it bob, it cruises pass

Moves 'cross land, but not to fast

I've been here before and done a million things

But you're making up for it now
I suffer amnesia when you kiss my brow

You came back, you came back
And I'm glad you begged my time
You came back, you came back
And with that mischievous look in your eye

I'd say before long, if I'm not wrong
You'll be back, you'll come back again
",You Came Back

Face the face, got to face the face

You must have heard the cautionary tales
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails
From wiser men who've been through it all
And the ghosts of failures spray-canned up on the wall

We've got to judge the judge
Got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
Have to line the lines
We must stake the stakes
And show the shown
We must take the takes
And know the known
Try to place the place
Where we can face the face.
We got to face the face
Try to place the place
Where we can face the face
Face the face, got to face the face.
Face the face, got to face the face.

Got to
Got to

You must have tried and defied belief
Maybe found futility in insular grief
I need your hunger you need mine
A million appetites can swallow up time.

We've got to fool the fools
We got to plan the plans
We got to rule the rules
We got to stand the stands
We got to fight the fight
We must fall the falls

Pete Townshend,"His pride is like a bandage
He's wrapped in a warm cocoon
His pride is just like heroin
He's back inside the womb

His pride is like an ocean
Encircled by a reef
His pride's an hypnotic potion
His memory is a leaf

Her pride is like an armour
Flaming ring of fire
Her pride is like a blindness
An ever tightening wire

Her pride is like a razor
A surgeon's purging knife
Her pride is like a censor
She's slashed out half her life

Pete Townshend,"Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
You once believed that crazy accidents
Were happening to you
You were chasing a capricious wind
Whenever bad luck and trouble
Happened to pursue you
The dice would surely save your skin
But when you look back you must realize
That nothing in your life's divine
Everything that's ever befallen you
Happened simply 'cause it crossed your mind
You're crashing by design
Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
In your single-roomed flat in a courtyard building
You sit alone just like a broken toy
Where's your mother, where's your lover
And where are the children
Are you a man or still a boy?
Who left you behind, or did you run
From the crush of so many options?
Now you know the special despair of the man
Discussed, debated and offered for adoption
Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
Another man without a woman
Dropped like a useless tool no longer required
A man who longs for the stifling
Milk flowered bosom, a fool
Who's no longer desired

Another man without a woman
Too many rages have cost you this time
Another man among a hundred children
You're just a child who is lost in time

Pete Townshend,"From my window, I see roads
Lead to darkness, leading home
In the midnight of a soul's unsleeping
I hear the waterfall of women weeping

Hear the distant noise of traffic stalling
I hear the prostituted children calling
From the barred and mesh-floor streets
Of a winter's night, without a moon

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out

I look over chequered fields
And the towering web of steel
Young and old will sit and judge unfeeling
While the empty church's bell are pealing

And the green hills lay ignored, untended
Lonely watchers remain unbefriended
And out in the one way streets
Is a swelling maze, without a door

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here

I am safe hidden here

I am safe hidden here

My heart is touched, 
By awakening faces.
I see the panic, 
Of people in motion.
I can stand here, 
Look out on an ocean.
I am a wall, 
Awaiting a catchword.
I see the city laid out like a patchwork.

Alone, I am free, from hatred and blindness.
I hope that this life, 
Is frozen and timeless.
My man is here, 
We grow old by inches.
Tomorrow, I'll walk among heroes and princes.

I feed the boys, 
I hear secrets whispered.
I know the hearts that are battered and blistered.

This is my cell,
But it's connected to starlight.",I Am Secure

Down to the refuge, near QPR
I drive to committees in my German car
Prone to violence, prone to shame
I glide in silence, my pride in vain
For no one remembers, not that I can see
That we were defenders, we were the free

The White City, blood was an addiction
Now it is analyzed just as though it were fiction
That battles were won and battles were blown

And then the sound of Brixton gun and the scream of a child.

there ain't no color in memories.
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV
while I was laughing at Dom DeLuise.

I've gotta stop drinking, I've gotta stop thinking,
I've gotta stop smoking.

blackening the promises, the tears and the rain.
The fire will burn
'til the wind begins to turn
and it all begins again.

Pete Townshend,"A love born once must soon be born again
A spark that burned, then died, leaving cinders to be fanned
By the wind and thrown to flame;
Flames like tongues impassioned in a moments burst.
Tell me friend - why do you stand aloof from your own heart?
The truth confronts you - the truth confronts you as the sea
Crushing without detail,
Impassioned and detached,
Killing with love and power in God's Name.
Love conquers poses. Love smashes stances. Love crushes angles
Into black. So you, without question, know your first love
Is your last. And you, will never - never - Love again
I always wished to walk with her into resteraunts, (A clammy tale).
To be seen beside her at the public bar footrail.
I always wanted to be matched with her -
Yet her beauty was so different to mine.
My ""beauty"" needs an understanding, a knowledge of what I am.
Hers is enough. Earned through eons; for that is what true beauty is -
Time's gift to perfect humility.

But God help me -
May I be matched with you again

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
'Til the stars that were there before return above you
'Til you whisper to me once more: ""Darling, I love you!""

to see what parcels are for free
In curiosity.

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is.
How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave.

Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently,
And unaware of anything.
Playing proxy pin ball
picks his nose and smiles and
Pokes his tongue at everything.

but how can men who've never seen
Light be enlightened.
Only if he's cured
will his spirits future level ever heighten.

My ship ain't got no captain, my ship ain't got no crew
My ship ain't got no captain, my ship ain't got no crew
Doin' that tide dare blow me,their my passing few to do

I look around for a savior, who saves me from the hungry sea
I look around for a savior, who saves me from the hungry sea
Maybe he's down at the bottom, waiting patiently for me",Driftin' Blues
Pete Townshend,"The river is always flowing
Relentless towards the coastal tides
It travels down to the great ocean
While most of us simply watch from the water side

The water becomes Siddhartha's teacher
Sometimes powerful and stern
Sometimes gentle , forgiving
It never changes in direction
As it carries even mountains down to the sea

I'll take you over
I don't want your money
Just hang on tight
Till we reach the other wall
Things in Vegas
They all cling to my ankle
The horn blows wide, and the currents roar

God fill this gutter
That breaks my shoulder
Smash me to pieces
And wash me to mud
Dry me to dust
And set me to smolder
Please let me dissolve in the autumn flood

The rivers always flowing
But I'm free now
From It's grace
I'll be swept down to the ocean
And now you
You will take my place",The Ferryman
Pete Townshend,"I was listen to a guitar, bass drum thing
Started hearing chest screech, thought I had a gut strength
Then I saw a big band, right on the pavement
Violins and heavy boots, wondering where the wave went

You!
What?
I'm talking to you, Your wearing the wrong colored scarf
So what?
Well your playing your tune, to the Tarrence enemy Hauf
Hey you!
What?
I'm talking to you, Concentrate on the game
What for?
Well the whistle just blew, the conductors going to complain
Play the song, on the wall, come on pass me the ball

Don't let the violinist, trouble your playing
Fierce looking people ,but their managers gay
Syncopation to the sound of the ball
Trouble with the ref, on in the concert hall
Hey you!
What?
That cellist was found, that conductor must be blind
It's a girl!
whew
Oh look at the crowd
This session has run into extra time
Sit back, face off the senior, doesn't walk alone

Music has arrived at the football stadium
A logical step would be spears at the Palladium
Fifty thousand watts screaming out for a goal
Why don't they blow a whistle in rock and roll
Hey you!
What?
Get back in your seat The song has just begun
So what?
We need two encores to beat, and the band is faced to run
Hey you!
What?
Get down off of the wire, the game is still strong
Say's who?
Well I'll never talk, Kicking my piano around
All you fans of the score, if you give a show of support
Will?
Win.",Football Fugue [Live]
Pete Townshend,"When I have to get on my bike
When I look back on my life
I think of the days of the wine
Of what I put you threw that time

Pick up the pieces another day

And pretty brown blue eyes

Girl in the suitcase

Couldn't get use to a new place

Took you along in a suitcase

All the best things happened last
And you where always there
When carried down from stairs

I think about my effect on you
The way you were born so true
Did you relay care
That Alice cut my hair

Pete Townshend,"Happy Jack wasn't old but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle Of Man
The kids all would sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey

But they never stopped Jack or the water lapping
And they couldn't distract him from the seagulls flapping
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they never stopped Jack or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

They never stopped Jack nor the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

",Happy Jack
Pete Townshend,"I went to Dallas back in 82
The cafe society was numero oui
Surrounded by model, girls and guys in boots
I watched as they conspired taking parking lot dues
Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like ivy
She grows on it

I realize if all the beautiful girls
Were lost like gems, will grow to pearls
Now Holly is behind me,
And I fall from the place
I've got this burning sensation
As she brushed my things
Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like ivy
She grows on it

Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me

I know I must hurry back there
And look for Holly with her long brown hair
I was brit by some relief
All I want for Christmas is her two front teeth

Pete Townshend,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing,
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating,
We were the first band to vomit in the bar,
And find the distance to the stage too far,
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock,
Rock is dead they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving,
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins,
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong,
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone,
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

Landslide, rocks are falling,
Falling down 'round our very heads,
We tried but you were yawning,
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.

The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps,
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps,
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle,
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles,
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.

Pete Townshend,"I used to wake up in the morning
I always feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad

He said, ""Son now here's some little something""
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily let me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily make me feel alright

Pictures of Lily, Lily, oh Lily
Pictures of Lily, Lily, oh Lily

And then one day things weren't so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, ""Son, now don't be silly""

""She's been dead since 1929""
Oh, how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
But their was always,
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily to help me feel alright
Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams
Hey I was wondering mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily?

Pete Townshend,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must've played them all.
But I never seen anything like him
In any amusement hall...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers,
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see no lights a flashin',
Plays by sense of smell,
Always has a replay,
An' never tilts at all...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.

Never seen him fall...

Holding your head to the sky, in there
Swinging the smoke around

Sin is from sin's to say
One minute here again, out of your brain

Stay away from them

As your hurting all together
Are you really getting threw

Would you be wrong to sing and dance
Life goes on forever
Understanding isn't really new

I am a fool you claim
We are one all the same
Then you surrender, and the case is closed

Guess you ride innocence
I cause a sin offense
Short change my heart, for a fashionable home

Praying the game we play
All do it every day
No point pretending nobody's fool
Staying the same we say
Bring on a change our way
Treating the Lord, like a teacher in school

And we check over each shoulder
Making sure that no one knows
As we get down on our knees

And yet the witness inside
Looking out threw our own eyes
Is there really worthy on the trees

Saying's from saves to say

But one that restores this land to me
This land where the color of love
Is be decree
Set it free!

You can demand that your love's defined
Before you jump in blind
Keep everything to plan
So you can remain a man

CROW
You can demand that your love is defined
Before you break and jump in blind
You have to keep everything to plan
Just so that you can remain a man

HOGARTH
You have imprisoned half your soul
You have denied the love that you hold
Your angry heart never seems to break
You've learned to give, but not to take

One heart divided
Cold civil wars
Like twenty million people crying
Take me I'm yours

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",New Life/Reprise
Pete Townshend,"Was there life before this love
Was there love before this I can see
Was there ever love for her before me
And if I look will she look back at me
Is fantasy enough?

Was there heat before this flame
Were there flames before this fire in my heart
Was I wrong about it from the start
Am I in ecstasy or next to see that fantasy's to blame

Was there life before this love

If I look will she look back at me
Is fantasy enough?

If this scene is in a dream
Then I'm perfect for the part I play
You can count on me to stand and say
""Was there ever life before this wonderful day?""

Was there heat before this flame
Were there flames before this fire in my heart
Was I wrong about it from the start
Am I in ecstasy or next to see that fantasy's to blame

If this dream's within a dream
Then I'll never swoon quite deep enough
No hypnotic trance quite sleep enough

If in this sweet dream I'm flying
I will never fly quite high enough
You will hear me crying high above

Was there ever life before this wonderful love?

Pete Townshend,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

To be the sad man
To be the bad man

Pete Townshend,"There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breathe rippling by
The note is eternal
I hear it, it sees me
Forever we blend as forever we die

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

As people a**emble
civilization is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives

And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Gas on the hillside
 Oil in the tea cup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dream
And our love is enough to knock down any wall
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
In us all

And words when you played your guitar

Flowing and blowing each man in its wake
Destroying itself in the end with vibration

The glass sets up a sound like people laughing
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing

Mmm.

I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

Find it, I got to hear it all again...
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greed's

Take a bow for the new revolution

Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

The change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
The world looks just the same
And history ain't blamed
Cause the banners, they are flown in the last war

No, no!
We don't get fooled again

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
Get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
The parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

Pete Townshend,"Music and vibrations are the basis of everything
They pervade everything, human consciousness is reflected by them
Atoms are vibrations between positive and negative forces
Some very subtle, some complex, but it's all music

Soon, we will switch in the whole world
Every person wearing an experience suit
Will share this adventure with us

The crowd rush in
Three circles are closing fast to form a perfect cushion as he lands
As Spinner hits the crowd and the long
Sustained final chord suddenly ends

Go straight to twenty-eight

Ray writes a letter


RAY: Dear Rosalind, thanks for the new tape. You did my song very well. But, be careful. Celebrities believe their actions affect the behavior of their fans. It is a conceit the press reinforce. They suggest they entrust their precious readers into the hands of the performer. But it's really the performer who entrusts his audience to the press. You must serve the press as well as the audience. For me, a journalist called Ruth Streeting has become a symbol for the press and the establishment. They can't accept that a shit like me has value. I've always needed to make a crowd look away from the beautiful toward me. The more distasteful Ruth Streeting finds that need, the more driven I am to perform especially for her. Her disgust is the most powerful motivator of the artist in me. And as this is the last time I'm writing to you, I can tell you now something that I hardly believe has happened. I have fallen in love with her.

You shone a light for me to follow
Knowing I would
You graced me with a precious gift
That no-one else could
Touched by your presence I surrender, oh yeah
You gave me a lead and I was a follower

That after my mention of Ray High last week
He's been seen out and about in the big city
Until now Ray's been locked away
Struggling with a follow-up to his last mega-excess

But rumor was he couldn't even open a bottle
Without a drink inside him
There was talk of a nervous breakdown
He's even got up the nose of his sexy manager

Poor old Rastus Knight
Now has a challenged coke habit
I've always had a soft spot for Rastus
And I've often seen him looking at it

While I was away in 'Frisco
I hear Ray went into my club and sat at my table
Why thanks Ray
That put an end to happy hour

Why my place anyway, Ray?

About peace and love

Has been rodent, drinking vintage Krug

I've planned an alternative
I will secretly commandeer one of the Grid life studios
And stage a live rock concert
For every single person wearing Grid suits
That's fifty percent of the world's population
The result will be amazing

Everyone who experiences the concert
Will slip out of their suit and come to the show
They will be drawn to it
This will produce the biggest live concert audience in history

ID-Ray High, Gridlife Chronicles, November the tenth, 1992
I'm working on my own in here, going over some old music I did in 1970
It's got something, something special, I could really dream then
It ain't such a bad dream either.

Walking to a club
I've been completely degraded by chasing publicity
Degraded, yeah, I'll never go back, I know too much
I know how it's done, I can't discover it all over again, make it seem new

You're great, Ray, you know that, man, here, hold up, this is the place
What? Can't go in here, that bloody cow Ruth Streeting uses this club
She hates my guts
It's her job to hate your guts, she's a journalist, it's nothing personal

Oh sod it, I forgot, of course she won't be here, she's in the States
Oh c'mon, let's go in anyway
We've got to get back in the mainstream sometime
Come on, you own shares in the place

That cow wrote that I'm ugly
Well, you are ugly
I'm not
Yes, you are
No, I'm not
Well, you are, actually
Oh bullocks, Oh, let's go in
",Meher Baba M3
Pete Townshend,"You will each hear your own song
Each your own note
Your own vibration in the cosmos
All of you will know one another through the other song
You will blend and get in harmony

As you blend your song will change
And at the end your music will turn into a sound so complete
That it will show us that we all are one
Free
We are in tune

I know what you've been up to

Alright, but I know what your game is too
The words of Rosalind's song say it all, really, don't they?
What a worry you are, Raymond Highsmith

Clutching to exclude

In Falmouth Bay
A blue whale rolls
Going to drown in the swill
From city sewer holes
Summers longer
Deltas gashed
Ancient trees
Uprooted, smashed
Time is generous more, take more
I must outrun the dinosaur

A silent temple
Marble hard
Decays and softens
Battle scarred
A relic deaf
To bits and streams
And polo necks
And perfect jeans
Obsessed with silence
Spiked by noise
I hold my son
I plan our toys
Time expansive more, take more
I must outlive the dinosaur

Rising rivers
Drown new shoots
Words and breath
In death cahoots
The strong survive
To wean more brutes
Who grow and seed
Extend their roots

And scab recruits
Like monkeys trapped
In monkey suits

Pete Townshend,"I remember being richer than a king
The minutes of the day were golden
I recall that when the joint passed round
My body felt a little colder
But now I'm like a sewer channel - running lime and scag
Let me get at the master panel - let me at my stack

The sea refuses no river
And right now this river's banks are blown
The sea refuses no river
Whether stinking and rank
Or red from the tank
Whether pure as a spring
There's no damned thing stops the poem
The sea refuses no river
And this river is homeward flowing

I have seen a trace of strain
In other's eyes not spoken
I must admit that I enjoyed their pain
But this time it's me that's broken
I demand for you and His
This must be the time
When we decide what freedom is
Turn water into wine

For the sea refuses no river
We're polluted now but in our hearts still clean
The sea refuses no river
We tried not to age
But time had it's rage
We're washed over stones
From babes into clones of the mean
The sea won't refuse this muddy river
Nor deny the sulfurous stream

There was a fool in a dressing robe
Riding out the twilight hour
Lonely and cold in an empty home
Trying to assess his power
But now he's like a stream in flood
Swollen by the storm
He doesn't care if he sheds his blood
Let him be reborn

For the sea refuses no river
Remember that when the beggar buys a round
The sea refuses no river
And rain fills the gutters
No time for stutters
This is our chance
To sing and to dance and to clown
The sea refuses no river
And rivers were sprung to drown

The sea refuses no river
No pecking code respected for the damned
The sea refuses no river
Whether starving or ill
Or strung on some pill
Just ''cause you own the land
There's no unique hand plugs the dam
The sea refuses no river
And the river is where I am

The river is where I am",The Sea Refuses No River

He said, come on and take what you'd like
And later tell me how you feel

So I looked up all around on this uneasy street
I'd have been happy if I had found
Something simple to eat

But just as he asked me, Maureen walked past
I said, Mr. Devil, she is so refined
He said, I tricked you little brother
I tricked you. little brother
That tricky little mother is mine

I wish I was as good as I look
I wish I was that good
I wish I was as good as I look
Wish I could be that good

It was too late for me
I'd just set eyes on my heart's ideal
I was in ecstasy I was up and ready to steal

So I looked up all around on this uneasy street
I kept on looking until I found the prints of my beloveds feet
I kept up the chase 'til I looked right in her face

I said, my darling, you have angel's eyes
She said to this little brother
You knew, little brother
This is just his still mother's disguise

I wish I was as good as I look
I wish I was that good
I wish I was as good as I look
Wish I could be that good

I just could not believe someone
So beautiful could not be pure
I prayed for some reprieve
I had to save her from the devil's lure

But I guess the devil was bound to win
On this uneasy street
I had to know what was beneath her skin
I had to face up to the devil's heat

But I didn't have to ask
She just took off her mask
In a second it was clear to see

He said I tricked you, little brother
I tricked you little, brother
This tricky little mother is me, is me, is me

I wish I was as good as I look
I wish I was that good
I wish I was as good as I look
Wish I could be that good

Please see for me, that she's wearing a coat so warm
Keep her from... that howling wind.

Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
And flows and flows on down her breast.
Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her the best.

The many times I've often laid
In the darkness of my light
The brightness, of my day.

How it fits into the twines and how the rhythm flows,

Is the poetry there for perception for even tired eyes?

Fingers through grubby summer grasses,
As polluted pearls burst over rooftops;
Hope encapsulating a moment of truth in a moment of time.

Yes, Yes, it's a moments like this I can run barefoot
Over wet paving stones that the city performs its bitter
Reflections without regret,
For it's in good hands, in good hands,
The hands of the Master.

Yes Yes Yes, just this feeling, just the feeling, the feeling,
You can feel it; I can feel it,
Streaming through me, continuous, enchanting rhythm,
And the rhythm's enchanting,
And the rhythm's like season rhythms,
River rhythms, sea rhythms, sun rhythms, love rhythms,
And even in the roaring traffic's rude rhythms,
Overlapped the electronic chains;
City birds chirp communications.
Oh Yes, Yes

And the love flows on
Feeling in the misused madness
Which works to separate the unity of all creation,
And the chains which would bind us,
And in my bones,
And in the inner functions of my unbelievable being.

Yes Yes Yes Yes
And the love flows on, and the love flows on,
And the love flows on, and the love flows on.

And in the million frowns,
And in the million sightless eyes,
Jostling for a place in the circle of perfection;
And I can feel it in you who listen to the song
And in you who do not listen to the song
And in you who may never hear the song,
Oh Yes, Yes

And the love flows on, never ending,
Never resting,
Everywhere and in everything that manifests.
Is there anything which God isn't?

And in my heart I want to say I love you;
And in my prayer I want to say I love you;
And I love you, and I love you
And you and you and you and you and you .....
And yes and yes and yes and yes
And the love flows on, and the love flows on......",Affirmation
Pete Townshend,"Stop cold in your tracks;
This brother could not relax;
And like a stone between my eyes,
I'm gonna shed its disguise;
Don't let me lose, don't let me lose contact. 

Movin' fast with the feeling;
Pulling hard and there's no concealing;
Diamond fingers pull me through;
Couldn't do it without you.
Now I'm seeing what, I'm seeing what I believe in. 

You give me a piece of your action;
You star (stone) me with a calm;
I've been fed off my kharma,
Too much, much too long. 

Being pushed at the frontier;
Feel it up to my ears;
To you my life is melting in,
Without you to helter shelter me.
Now I'm not stoppin', not stoppin' where love is feeling",Contact
Pete Townshend,"When you're feeling low
Try a day of silence
Take things very slow
Listen to the wireless

Never speak a sound
Sit up on the hedgerow
Watch the world go round
Peace will let your mind go

When you've had a row
Sit alone say nothing
It's really funny how
You quickly see that something

Wonderful and warm
Lies between each second
In every side and out
Eternity will beckon

You and me, we are part of a single soul
And one day we will know we're one
Sit and listen the word will come
There is nothing beneath the sun that we can't realize

And one peaceful night
Will remind us that it's alright
And we'll figure we owe it all
To one life of silence

Whispers will emerge
Proud against the thunder
The wind hiss precious words
Erase our problems rumble

Watch a speckled fawn
Hear it crash like seaspray
Someone sees it all
We will meet him someday

When you're feeling low
Try a day of silence
Take things very slow
Maybe listen to the wireless
",Day of Silence
Pete Townshend,"As I walk out on the street,
The lamps are shining bright,
And the rain begins to fall,
Gonna be another wet night.

And I stand with my back to the wall,
Waiting for your call,
Then I'll know you love me,
Just like you ought to do,
Just like you us taught to do,
Who.

So you turn on to a mirror,
And the reflection of all you saw,
Now the path is in front of you,
Another boarded door.

And I stand here a-smiling,
Waiting for his call.
We all know he loves us,
Just like we knew he did,
Right down beyond the years,
And beyond the din of all.

Every day the dragon comes
With its many heads.
With a sword of truth in my hand,
I have laid it dead.

Only cause there's love in my heart,
Just like at the start.
And you and I were never apart,
Just like it ought to be,
Just like he made me see
Who.

As I walk out on the street,
The stars are shining bright.
And the ground a heavenly rose,
That shines ever so bright.

And I stand here in ecstasy,
I look back at the tears;
I have seen my Master,
After all of these years.
Now I know he loves me;
Now I ain't got any fears;
Please accept a gift of tears.

Pretend you're simply me, and I am you
Watch the way we weep and slip under
Making love before the evening through.

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
Or tomorrow , die.

Don't you know that he's in our town
Someone wrote it on the wall
Just for us he can be found
But do we really need to call.
Care at all.

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
If tomorrow he should die.

Yaaaah
(Guitar Solo)

Tickle me don't let me hear him singing
Dance for me don't let me see his face
Sing for me don't answer any questions
Love me don't love him don't lead the race.

He didn't even come out of his caravan
Just swung these leapers out the door
How can you imagine that he's human
Can I match your money you have seen before.
Never less I will

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
Cause tomorrow he's going to die

Say hello to the love man

Pete Townshend,"'Jai Baba, folks

Mary Jane became a good friend to me
He showed me ways, a different way to be
But now's comes a time to move further down the line
So get your ten lil' fingers off of me

Mary Jane promised me so much
My soul has been used to your touch
But for every thing you gave, I then became your slave
Mary Jane, please take your hands off of me this minute

There are millions out there waiting for your charms
So proud Mary, go and take them in your arms
And threw her lovely eyes, you'll see a new sunrise
But will they see the things as they are?

They've taken me on one fantastic life
They've seen how I failed when I tried
I think that now and then I could take you again
But now I've got someone else inside

Mary Jane there are things that I've been told
By a man who is very, very old
He says it's up to me and if I can but see
His silver will give way to his gold

Hoping to discover

Pete Townshend,"It takes a fool to phone a fool
When they both have said it all
We make the rule and bemoan the rule
That neither soul should call

But love that was is love that is
Demands to always be unchanged
But then all lovers are deranged

We walk away with memories
And clutch them to our hearts
We disembodied entities
We loves in fits and starts

For love like wine intoxicates
It drives all of you drink insane
But then all lovers are deranged

You know that you don't really fall in love
Unless you're seventeen
Then break your word, let your spirits fly
But you can't know what it means
Unless you're seventeen

It takes a fight to start a fight
And differences remain
We have the right to think, we're right
We're addicts feigning shame

For love recalled, is love reborn
We're determined to revive the pain
But then all lovers are deranged
All lovers are deranged

It takes a fool to phone a fool
When they both have said it all
We make the rule, bemoan the rule
That neither soul should call

Pete Townshend,"The iron man came to the top of the cliff
How far had he walked nobody knows
Where had he come from nobody knows
How was he made, nobody knows
Taller than a house, the iron man stood
At the top of the cliff in the darkness

The wind sang through his iron fingers
And his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin
But as big as a bedroom
Slowly turned to the right, slowly turned to the left
He was hearing the sea

His eyes like headlamps, glowed white then red
Then infra-red, searching the sea
Never before had the iron man seen the sea

He swayed in the strong wind that pressed against his back
He swayed forward on the brink of the high cliff
And his right foot, his enormous iron right foot
Lifted-up out into space

And the iron man stepped forward, off the cliff into nothingness
Crash
Down the cliff, the iron man came toppling head over heels
Crash, crash, crash

From rock to rock, tumbling slowly
And as he crashed and crashed, his iron legs fell off
His iron arms broke off
And the hands broke off the arms

His great iron ears fell off
And his eyes fell out
His great iron head fell off

All the separate pieces tumbled scattered crashing
Bumping clanging down, on to the rocky beach far below
Then silence

Nobody knew the iron man had fallen
Nobody knew the iron man had fallen",Iron Man Recitative

Unaware of who was feeding whom

You will eat with anyone that's agreeing

We laughed while we dine
I served the entrees
You served the spirits and the wine

But time heals and while
We laughed through our meals
I cheated desire
Fading and tired and pine

So won't you RSVP now
Say it right to my face
Have a Maxim more for the road
And let's get out of this place

I spent too long on the queue
You over drank the Le Tour
Let's get back to wafers and water

Here is message number eight, I'm so far away
I'm so lost and lonely now

Trodden down with my leather shoe
Killing ants as I talk to you
Squashing mites as I deeply slept
This is the record that I kept

Squirm, squirm went the worm
Squirm, squirm went the worm

Here is message number one, I am your beloved son
Here is message number two, I'm in love with only you
Here is message number three, you cannot escape from me
Here is message number four, help

Flying with a purple dove

Pete Townshend,"I went back to the doctor to get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betray what he thinks

Can you see the real me, doctor?

I said, ""I'm crazy, Ma, help me""
She said, ""I know how it feels, son
'Cause it runs in the family""

Look like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane

Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now

Oh, can you see the real me?
Can ya, can ya?
Can you see the real me, can ya?

I went to the holy man, full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate, I said

Can't you see the real me?
Can't you see the real me?

Can't you see the real me?
Can't you see, can't you see?
Ah, no, ooh

Rock and roll's gonna do me
Do me an evil wrong
Funny how your best friends turn out
It was good for, oh, so long

Can't stop myself getting letters
And then the people try to turn me back
Publisher want my memoir
And my limousines are black

Oh, can't you see the real me?

I was brought up right
You cold hold me down

You spray like a tomcat
Piss like a stray dog
Swear like a sailor

Kicking in chorus
Stabbing to order
Slashing like a blind man
Lost like a soldier

Spreading like an oil slick

Or where I'm gonna go

I read about myself in the newspapers
I'm a pig
I'm a thug

Pete York,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan

Two A.M. it's dark

Pete Yorn,"I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radios on and I'm moving round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere just living
In a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and its on me
Ill shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laughs on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting round here trying to write
This book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting round crying
Over a broken heart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about
Your little world falling apart

Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark",Dancing in the Dark [*]
Pete Yorn,"Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself
Could life ever be sane again
On the Leeds side streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself
Hopes may rise on the Grasmeres
But honey pie, you're not safe here
So you run down
To the safety of the town
But there's panic on the streets of Los Angeles
Dublin, Dundee, Echopark
I wonder to myself
Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed D.J.
Because the music they constantly play
On the Leeds side streets that you slip down
On the provincial towns that you jog 'round

Pete Yorn,"Every now and then I get like this
And it isn't hard to see
But the old man in the kitchen
I think he's part of me
Don't say nothing bout the old house
Cause I burned it to the ground
And when the darkness comes, 
I lie awake
Playing lost and found
All at once
I break my silence
All at once
There's no more hiding
And all he wants
Is to show us how he feels
They're all liars in the back room
Watch them all go down
They can tell you what you want to hear
But they will never stick around
So don't say nothing 'bout the old house
Cause I burned it to the ground
And when the darkness comes 
I'll lie and wait
Still playing lost and found
All at once
I break my silence
All at once
There's no more hiding
And all he wants 
Is to show us how he feels
When he comes around
Do not tell him nothing
Do not make a sound
Cause if he knows we're there
He might tear his heart out 
And beat us to death with it
I was too young to understand.",All at Once

Pete Yorn,"Man in uniform told me 
He wants to get out
Didn't see it coming 
Head in from the west
And it's he who choose
To reach another level 
I never even saw it
Before today

Paint a different circle
Can I wonder how
You never let me down?
If it's we who choose
I'll reach another level

How it reminds me of you
Broken like a vision, an unfinished season
Terror had struck me, but all I could see is your soft skin
And I wondered
Inside the workhouse, you mind your own business
And I had the courage of two
And as I requested a lapse in your presence
I couldn't think of anything important to say

Peter & Gordon,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen

There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was
Rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married
And had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made
Has a kink
Chain mail pants with a missing link

Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

 Just to get through it
 Once again you'll be mine

Peter & Gordon,"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool

Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

There lived a knight who 
Wasn't quite as bold 
As a knight should be 

He rode an old grey mare called Bess 
Searchin' for a damsel in distress 
Just to see if he 
Could set her free 

See the knight in rusty armour ride 
To her aid 
Trusty sword is hanging at his side 
With a rusty blade 

Up the tower steps he sneaked 
But as he moved 
His rusty armour squeaked 
Such a mournful note 

And all the sentries at their posts 
Thought it must have been the castle ghost 
They jumped for their lives 
In the moat 

So the knight in rusty armour won 
His fair maid 
Had no need to draw his trusty sword 
With a rusty blade 

As he bent to kiss his bride 
He found that he was 
Rusted up inside 
In his battle dress 
And I can't guess 

How they still got married 
And had twins 
They came in tins 
Every suit of armour ever made 
Has a kink

Peter Alexander,"Draußen am alten Brunnen, der alle Pferde tränkt
Sitzt er im Gold des Abends, wenn sich die Sonne senkt
Dort, wo des Gauchos Herde über die Weiden zieht
Singt er der kleinen Niña zärtlich sein schönstes Lied

Der Mond hält seine Wacht
Wenn in der Nacht
Ein goldener Stern dir winkt
Der Mond, der sieht von fern
Wie dieser Stern
Das Glück dir bringt

Ei - ja, tschiba, tschiba
Niña, Niña, ich bin dir nah, so nah
Ei - ja, tschiba, tschiba
Niña, Niña, ich bin dir nah

Über die grünen Weiden zog er so manches Jahr
Als seine Señorita längst seine Niña war
Schön, wie die weiße Rose, war sie für ihn erblüht
Und unter ihrem Fenster sang er sein Liebeslied

Peter Allen,"The late george wallno 
Worked on high street and lived on manners
52 years he sat on his verandah, made his saddles

You just asked the saddler, he lived without sin
They're building a library for him

Time is a traveller

Turn your head
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The son of george wallno went off and got married and had a war baby
But something was wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad
Well george had no answers about why her son ever has need of a gun

Time is a traveller
Tenterfield saddler
Turn your head
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The grandson of george has been all around the world and lives no special place
Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face
He'd almost forgotten them both because of the life that he leads
There's nowhere for george and his library or the son with his gun to belong
Except in this song

Somehow this feeling just grows and grows

More lost without you and so it goes

She may not be the latest rage
But she's singing and she means it
And she deserves a little silence

Quiet please, there's a woman up there
And she's been honest through her songs
Long before your consciousness was raised
Now doesn't that deserve a little praise

So put your hands together and help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song
Stand for the ovation
And give her one last celebration

Quiet please, there's a person up there
Who's singing of the things
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves
Give her your respect if nothing else

Put your hands together and help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song
Rise to the occasion
Give her one last celebration

Quiet please, there's a lady on stage
Conductor, turn the final page
When it's over we can all go home
She lives on, on the stage alone

So put your hands together, help her along
All that's left of the singer's all that's left of the song

Put your hands together and help her along

Won't you rise to the occasion?
And won't you give her one last celebration?

Put your hands together, help her along

Peter Allen,"Comin' home used to feel so good
I'm a stranger now in my neighborhood
I've seen the world at a faster pace
And I'm comin' now from a different place

Though I may look the same way to you
Underneath there is somebody new

I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me

I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door

You've been savin' all souvenirs
Faded photographs from my foolish years
We made plans, but they're wearin' thin
And they won't work out 'cause I don't fit in

And those memories will just weigh me down
'Cause I got no place to keep 'em uptown

I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me

I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door

And I'm sorry for just bein' me
But if you'd look past the past you could see
That

I am not the boy next door

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time

How you gonna do it if you really won't take a chance,
By standing on the wall? Get your back up off the wall.

Get down on it - get down on it - get down on it
Get down on it - when we're dancin' - get down on it

Is there something that I said or done to you?

Feel you running away from my love
Why you running away from my love
It's cold when we're apart
And it's playing in my heart
The moments that we shared will stay
In my heart, i.....feel you

Thinking of the lovin' we made
Baby, I love the way you touch me in that special way
So why do I feel like a man that's being played
Tell me it isn't true (spoken)
I'm begging baby, stay

You got me going crazy
I've been waiting by the phone
I'm thinking about the things that I want to do to you
Soon as you get home
I give you everything
But in my heart i......

Or what it's gonna take to get over you

It's the hardest thing I've ever done
Watchin' you turn and walk away

How I long to hear you say
Let's give it one more try
But I know you're going
Trying to stop my tears from showing
And I, how can I sleep, how can I, live without

The one that I still need right here in my arms

Watchin' you turn and walk away

Out in the cold

Oh baby you're still the one
That I need to hold

Baby please forgive the foolish heart that told you that
When the road got rough I started doubting myself
Still I can''t believe that life''s worth living

When we know we''ll only cry
We''re gonna be lonely
(Gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there''ll be someone else
For me there''s you only
(Gonna be lonely)

All we need to make it right is precious time
But it''s funny such a simple thing''s so hard to find
Don''t know when or where we started
Living separate lives
But I know it''s still worth fighting for
I see it in your eyes

So why do we say goodbye
When we know we''ll only cry
We''re gonna be lonely
(Gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there''ll be someone else
For me there''s you only
(Gonna be lonely)

Now I realise that I''ve been living so selfishly
Someone along the way
I forgot you had your own hopes and dreams
I never meant to make you weak
But I was too blind to see that I''ve been hurting you
How I made you blue
Now guilt is killing me

So why do we say goodbye
When we know we''ll only cry
We''re gonna be lonely
(Gonna be lonely)
And why do we fool ourselves
Saying there''ll be someone else

Peter Andre,"Thinkin back to the time when I was so into you
I thought that I knew it all
My perseption of love
Well it was something to do
But I didn't expect the thought
I understand your fellings of doubt
I know I must have let you down
But I wonder would you be around
If I loved you the right way
Loved you the right way
I would have put that smile upon your face
Loved you the right way
Never thought that id thank you for the hert and the pain
And the changes you put me through
I guess I needed to look at my intensions again
I didn't give enough to you
My mind has never been so clear
And I feel my happiness is near
But I wonder if you'd still be here if I loved you the right way

'Cause you diserve the right way
I should have put that smile upon your face
I should have kept you in my warm embrace
Loved you the right way
Sometimes love is so mistaken
Simple values put aside
Mind love is just a ride
When its over no one seems to care
If I ever find myself with someone new
I'll remember what I learnt from you
Yeah
And I will love her the right way
Love her the right way
I will put that smile on her face
I will keep her warm in my embrace
I will love her baby
Make each day a better day
Never gonna sacrifice a mean
I will love her the right way
I'm gonna love her baby
I'm gonna love her baby",The Right Way [Radio Edit]

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you

That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

To hold you ever so tight

Peter Beets,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Peter Beets,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Peter Bernstein,"The weather is frightening.

That as far as I'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's okay.

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain.
You were going on your way, now you've got to remain.

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea,
The clouds broke, they broke and oh what a break for me.

I can see the sun up high, though we're caught in a storm.

A long time ago,
'cause I heard some song I used to hear back then,
A lone time ago.
I remember when, even further back,
In another town,
'cause I saw something written I used to say back then,
Hard to comprehend

And the question is, was I more alive
Then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree;
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now,
I am more me.

But of cause some days, I just lie around
And hardly exist,
And can't tell apart what I'm eating
From my hand or my wrist.
'cause flesh is flesh, flesh as flesh as flesh,
The difference is thin.
But life has a certain ability or breathing new
Life into me,
So I breathe it in.
It says here we are, and we all are here,
And you still can make sense,
If you just show up and present an honest face,
Instead of that grin.

And the other day, this new friend of mine
Said something to me
""just because something starts differently,
Doesn't mean it's worth less.""
And I soaked it in, how I soaked it in,
How I soaked it in
And just as to prove how right he was,
Then you came.

I'm gonna give you a try,

Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Peter Bocage,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street

At the setting of your skies
As we leave the comfort of your ground
With your angels we will fly

Well you carried us in broken dreams
Like a mother does her sons
We were scattered 'cross your dirty streets
We were dying one by one

And you held us in your city lights
When our eyes had lost the stars
And we made our peace with lonely nights
And you healed our broken hearts

Well they say the big one's gonna come
And you'll fall into the sea
But we will know that then your work is done
And your angels will go free

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Peter Breiner,"I've played the game of love before
Too young to know
How hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought
The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love

Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love

To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'

Peter Breiner,"Look at how she looks at me
I can never look at her that way
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say
In all the words, in all the books
I wish there were a way to say that
What she's taught me
Isn't written anywhere
And I'm supposed to be the one
Who's wise
One thing is certain
I can never be what she 
Expects of me
I've wanted the shadows
I don't anymore
No matter what happens
I won't anymore
I've run from the sunlight
Afraid it saw too much
The moon had the one light
I bathed in
I walked in
I held in my feelings
And closed every door
No matter what happens
I can't anymore
There's someone who must hear
The words I've never spoken
Tonight if he were here
My silence would be broken
I need him to touch me
To know the love that's in my heart
The same heart that tells me
To see myself
To free myself
To be myself at last!
For too many mornings
The curtains were drawn
It's time they were opened
To welcome the dawn
A voice deep inside
Is getting stronger
I can't keep it quiet any longer
No matter what happens
It can't be the same anymore
I promise it won't be the same
Anymore!

Peter Breiner,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life
Peter Breiner,"There's not a morning I begin
Without a thousand questions
Running through my mind
That I don't try to find the reason
And the logic in the world
That God design
The reason why, a bird was given wings
If not to fly, and praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things

And why have eyes that see
And arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know there's
Something more
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for
Why have the wings unless you're meant to fly
And tell me please why have a mind
If not to question why

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to have the chance to
Pick the fruit of every tree
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where

If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to see the meanings
In the mornings that I see
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where
Or if it's written anywhere
",Where Is It Written [From Yentl]
Peter Breiner,"Look at how he looks at her
Will someone ever look at me that way
Full of all the feelings and the soft
Unspoken words that lovers say?
I thought that I knew every single
Look and sweet expression on his face
Yet this is one that I don't recognize
Although I've sat and studied him for hours
But now I see how love completely occupies
A pair of' eyes
See the way' they gaze at her
Like slaves they follow every where she goes
Do my eyes forget themselves
And do I ever look at him
And smile in such a way
That what I'm feeling shows?
Sometimes I have the feeling
Everybody knows
And even though it's crazy
Still I can't help wondering 
If  I'll ever live to see the day
When by some miracle of miracles
He'll turn around
And look at me that way!

Peter Breiner,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Peter Breiner,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

Now let's ride

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride

I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride

Peter Brown,"Well you got to clap your hands, it's a long way to heaven, 
You can't let living way you down.
As far as I'm concerned, it ain't no good for nothing
To worry 'bout where you're bound.

You got to be a friend to your brothers and sisters
You got to help them see the light
As far as they're concerned life is a journey in darkness, 
Their love is shining through the night

And we got love love love in our hearts tonight, 
We got love in our hearts
And we got love love love in our hearts tonight
We got love in our hearts

Well there's got to be a way, we could help one another
Don't have to face the world alone.
We gotta hold the hands up, someone who needs you.
Help him on a journey home

You got to close your eyes, to see tomorrow, 
Imagine what the future could be.
Should you be concerned, bout the way things going, 
Then make it only love that you see

[Chorus]

Oh but that's the way, that the world keeps on turning, 
Round an round we go.
As far as I'm concerned, well it may not be heaven, 
But it's better then what's down below.

So let's all join hands, and head for that rainbow, 
Keep working till our dreams come true.
And we all live together, in the promised land, 
And start the world new.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

The tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe. 
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all 
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way

Well, I started out 'neath the spring
And smoke down a gravel road where the gate was broke
I reached her house, saw the golden glow
The hearthstone fire all lined with coal

I said, I'm gonna change my ways

Couples were dancing by the jukebox light
Cops were out front sipping cokes uptight
She smiled at me, said, “Honey, come on in
Sit right here, won't you hold my hand”

I said, I, I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, said, I'm gonna change my ways
Oh, I think I'm gonna change my ways

Soaring above the penitentiary
In the northern lights but the sky was blind
Confusion sounds for a troubled mind

Said, I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, I, oh, one of these days
Alright, come on now, hey

Yeah, by the rescue mission and the Goodyear blimp
Spied a one arm man walking with a limp
I got another chance then I blew it to bits
I made a new start by calling it quits

I said, I could've changed my ways

Yeah, said I, oh, one of these days

Yeah, I'm gonna change the way I shuffle the cards
Change the angles I play when I'm crossing the yard
Gonna change my ways, I'm losing control
I'm starting over with a brand new soul

Peter Case,"This place has changed since we were the kings
The shops torn down where we pawned our rings
8 by 10's no one sees no more
Like Telly Savalas hangin' by the door, Palookaville

Well, you can't tell your baby how a left jab feels
The first you take rocks you on your heels
Soon you're back in the car up for the long ride home
The canvas is splattered with your blood and bone, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

The crowd was dressed in leathers and lace
They scream for more, why you work this fast?
Then they tore up their programs and they jumped to their feet
Whatd'ya say, we go get somethin' to eat? Over in Palookaville

Palookaville cast off by crooks
A punch drunk fighter with two left hooks
You only blame yourself for the way it went
You threw away your chances now you're sweatin' the rent
All in Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

Now you're one of the crowd walkin' where they walk
There's a new kid hoppin' and talkin' the talk
But you know what's it's like fallin' off'a the map
Your heaven sent treasure got sprung like a trap
Over Palookaville

Now there's a boy in the dark he's got a ways to go
Underneath the covers with a radio
He's tunin' in a fight from Bangor Maine
Once you catch the bug it's never the same, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

",Palookaville
Peter Case,"Another night, another show
Another day so far to go
Couple hours, motel room
I'll be back on my highway soon

Forget tomorrow and the jam you're in
You're alive right now as you've ever been
The line you shoot will never miss
That's the old soul twist

The judge ignored your earnest pleas
Truth was buried, lies were eased
Come on down, try to sleep
Rest your eyes stay off your feet

You can walk the moon or swim the sea
If it's not too late it'll never be
You hold the treasure in your fist
Let it go, that's the old soul twist, that old soul twist

Bang it, dang it, hang it on the wall
Throw it out the window, run and catch it before it falls
Used to go like that, now it goes like this
Time to do that old soul twist

Pressures on, money's tight
Everything will be alright
Stay awake, stay alert
Do the things you know will work

The only strength is the strength to live
The only life is the life we give
Live to give, that's the word
And all the wisdom that I've heard

Used to go, now it goes like this
That's the old soul twist

",That Soul Twist
Peter Case,"It's cold outside, Lord help those
Lost tonight with the freezing toes
In the dark with the rain drenched clothes
She's all the way down

The sky has cleared, stars are bright
Temperature's gonna fall tonight
In the park looking for a light
She's in a hospital gown

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
It's another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'll say

Some drink wine, some are smokin' crack
This lady all alone wants none of that
In the park with a cart and sack
Afraid she's gonna drown

A choice she made not long ago
Has led to this, how could you know?
The door slammed shut, her children go
To whatever life they've found

Underneath the stars, what's it going to be?
In the house of mars, stranded by degrees
Hunger in the night, answered with a prayer
See the passing cars, there's nobody there

Now the clergy have their doubts
Are they helping lazy layabouts?
Late at night the drunken louts
Terrify the town

The cops are young, well, they're just kids
They don't know about the skids
They just do what the gentry bids
From the other end of town

Underneath the stars, who will crack the seal?
Waitin' here to die, numbers on a wheel
Figures in the dark, crouch against the wall
Out here in the park there's no one to call

Asleep in the park rain or shine
A thousand crows on the telephone line
Ask her how and she'll say fine
She's all the way down

Dew drops shot like cannonballs
Crash on paper prison walls
Her heart stops beating and her breathing stalls
She's dyin' all alone

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

So now you ask what can I do?
See and know, they're just like you
You could wind up in the blue
Beneath a pauper's crown

Don't be afraid, you'll be surprised
If when you look into their eyes
You find a soulful feeling rise
You're all the way down

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

",Underneath the Stars

Find a bit of paradise

You can hide if you want, you can change your name

Now's the time to slip away
Oh woman can't you see
I really want you here with me 
Hey Mama, I can make you forget
What you ever saw in him
Don't understand
Why you want to be with that man 

The time is right so take it from me
You'll find out when we're alone

I won't let you get away

All alone

Peter Cetera,"If you see me coming up an open road
With an empty glass and a single rose
Take a turn towards the shifting light
There you'll see my shadow lost in the night

Endless flight has no directions now
To a coward's kiss from a hero's vow
If I could find the words, I'd pick up the phone
If I was half a man, I wouldn't sleep alone

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Oh you shook your head like a wild horse
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Time just crawls here behind my eyes
If the scar heals, can our love survive
Life's only purpose seems so distant now
If there's a chance at all won't you show me how

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings",Dip Your Wings
Peter Cetera,"One big happy family
Together the rest of our lives
As far as our friends were concerned
Everything seemed right

But that's when she told me
She said me it was time to move on
Just something that she kept inside
That told me the thrill was gone

And now I can't believe
I can't believe it's over
Suddenly it's plain to see
She's leaving me and

Even a fool can see
There's nothing left between us
I knew all along something was wrong
But I did my best to deny it
And now I can't go home
She wants to be alone so
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright
Even a fool can see

There were times we had nothing
And somehow we laughed through it all
There are moments I'll never forget
And some I wouldn't care to recall

And still I can't believe
I can't believe it's over

She's doesn't need me

Peter Cetera,"In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
Was it all a dream?
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment, everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever felt
How far a heart can fall
Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out

What it's all about

You were so lovely
So very pretty

And when you turned into four

That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.

Blame it on the weather
Till I get over you.

Feels like rain
Feels like I'll never fall in love again
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way
And it feels like rain today

Hanging on every wall
Broken dreams, painfull memories
Like the times I never listened
And the times I didn't try
It's gotta be the weather
'Cause you're not here with me

Feels like I'll never fall in love again

And it feels like rain today

Regretting every minute
Since I watched you walk away
Cause it's not the same without you
And now the clouds are hiding
Every sunny day
I guess I'll stay inside again
Cause it feels like rain today

Feels like rain
Feels like we'll never fall in love again
There's a cold wind blowing every cloud my way
And the clouds are hiding every sunny day
And the storm is coming so I'm here to stay

Somewhere far away
Drowning over minutes that were yesterday
I wonder what you're doing
Do you feel this way
Are you thinking of me too?

Looking in the mirror all I wanna see
Is your pretty face smiling back at me
There's nowhere in the world that
I would rather be
Than to be back home with you

I'm on my way
I promise you that I won't be long
I just called
Called you to say
I miss every little little moment
Without you

And I can't wait
For us to be alone.
I'm almost in your arms.
I'm coming home.

And back when I'm alone
I really miss your touch
I hold on to your picture
And it means so much
To know that there is someone
Out there just for me
And
You feel the same way too?

Everywhere I go I'd wish
That You were there
Everything I know I'd wish
That we could share

Everywhere I go
Makes me miss you so,

I'm on my way,
I promise you that I won't be long
I just called, called you to say
I Miss every little moment without you

And I can't wait
For us to be alone
I'm Almost in your arms I'm Coming home.

I can touch you
Everytime I close my eyes
Baby you can feel it,
If you just believe I'm Coming
Oooh I'm coming home

Why should I feel the way I do?

But it's so hard loving you.

Ev'ry night?

Oh are you the one?

Peter Cincotti,"No one can buy tomorrow
No one can sell their sorrow
But when you look into my eyes
Darling, you'll always see

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

We'll have our good times
And even in sad times
With love we will find a way
Nothing else matters
But loving each other
The way that we do today

Here in our world together
Love will go on forever
Warm in the shelter of my arms
Darling, you'll always be

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

Here in our world together
Love will go on forever
Warm in the shelter of my arms
Darling, you'll always be

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

",Come Live Your Life With Me (The Godfather Waltz)
Peter Cincotti,"Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don't try hiding, it isn't any use
You'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you've ever been in love
That's all brother, you know just what I'm speakin' of

Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you can get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done",Comes Love
Peter Cincotti,"Don't keep on asking where I've been
I'm not some guy you discipline
Stop that crying
No use justifying
Baby, I changed the rules.
Don't keep me waiting at the door
I'm not some cat that you ignore
Keep on whining, and I'll keep on declining
Baby, I changed the rules.
You can't stop me from shooting the breeze
I always say and do as I please
But don't stop trying
You know I'm gratifying
Keep the pace
You're in the race
You feel the heat right by my side
Stay close, I'll take you for a ride
Stimulating
Really intoxicating

Peter Cincotti,"I raise my glass to our happy ending
I sip my wine to our grand demise
This game we played is finally over
Lovers, secrets, lies...

And now at last the spell is broken
The truth can now be spoken
Heartache is just a token
Lovers, secrets, lies...

No lonely night to wait and wonder, no secret sites for a rendezvous
My empty heart is well protected
Lovers, secrets, lies...

Forget the pain, forget the earning
My life is now returning
My heart's no longer burning
Lovers, secrets, lies...","Lovers, Secrets, Lies"
Peter Cincotti,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell. We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me",Rainbow Connection
Peter Cincotti,"What goes up must come down
Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning Wheel spinning true
Drop all you troubles by the river side",Spinning Wheel
Peter Cincotti,"When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Sway me now
",Sway
