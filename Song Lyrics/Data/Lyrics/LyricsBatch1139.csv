Beegie Adair,"Like you're alive again
Take ten broken limbs
And make it alright for them
And I needed you more,
More than you'll ever notice
But I need to do more
If you're to ever know this

Or you won't care at all
No, you won't care at all
For you won't care at all
No, you won't care at all

Dance puppet boy
If you do a good job
Then they'll want you again,
Give it all that you've got
Show them the joy and the pain and the ending
Then do it again, and we'll all stop pretending
They'll pay more attention to what's before mentioned
As you bob your head
'cause you're not even listening
A very small few of you even give meanings
But laugh, clown boy, laugh
'cause it's always so pleasing

Feel, damn you, feel
Like you're alive again
I needed to know,
Needed a show of hands
For all this couldn't be sure
As we see a lot of them
And I traded it all,
Could I make a difference
At all?

I met a woman,
She was wonderful,
Everything perfect,
We both had the world
But I filled up my senses
With thoughts from the ghost
And I spent her life savings
Left no room for
Both of us
Crying and trying
And screaming aloud,
I barely can see her tumultuous crowds
Are careful to hide her and sing much too loud
See, you don't even know what I'm talking about

Feel, damn you, feel
Like you're alive again
I needed you more,
Than you would ever've noticed
Et Al
Couldn't be sure
That you would ever notice
But I gave it my all
Did I make a difference at all?

Like you're alive again
Take ten broken limbs",As Time Goes By
Beelow,"* a re-issue of the original ""Ballin' 4 Billions""
[Beelow]
I'm tellin' ya, brah,
Them boys ain't got no deals,
I don't even know why they put that on there.

[Chorus] [Thug Addict]:
You got a BIG MOUTH, BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
Mouth ALMIGHTY, Mouth ALMIGHTY
You got a BIG MOUTH, BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
Mouth ALMIGHTY, Mouth ALMIGHTY

First Verse [C-Murder]:
Run your muthafuckin' mouth like you a broad or somethin',
These niggas actin' like they muthafuckin' hard or somethin',
I'm from the cold-hearted streets of the CP3,
The Calliope, where the other niggas just like me,
And bullet proofs on my muthafuckin' ass my nigga,
'cause when I bust I hold 'em up and let'em laugh my nigga,
I got some soldiers on that tank, that would ride for me,
My brother Silkk, even told me he would die for me,
You want beef? Or do you really even know what beef is?
We go to war, it's gonna be kinda hard for you and your kids,
My money too long, and my clique too strong,
And when it's on, it's on,
Put the chrome to your dome,
M-11's in the back of the benz, ya dig?
Just in case you get slack from your friends, ya dig?
Nigga you doin' too much, that's why your ass got touched,
You got a big mouth fool that's why I fucked you up

[Chorus]
Second Verse [Thug Addict]:
You want to stay in my business, tellin' my girl this tellin' my girl that,
Runnin' your trap, speakin' to me tryin' to gimme some dap,
All that yappety-yap, talkin' that bullcrap,
Tell them people bout my business talkin' behind my back,
I don't like that,
And around your mouth'll get you killed right fast,
And I can see straight through you like glass,
All that talkin' and tellin' and snitchin',
Tryin' to knock me out of position,
All that he say, she say, they say just make my day,
Man, you hear what Thug did with ol' girl around the way,
Talkin' loud, but ain't sayin' nothin',
Stuntin' and bluffin' gone get'cha caught up,
Get'cha sowed up,
You tried to get in that water, 
But it was harder that you thought up,
I'm the nigga that tell a daughter,
I says Mama, tell her Mama that I sexed her DAUGHTER,
Shit and ran a train on her,
You just mad, 'cause you couldn't do that,
Now you spreadin' them lies,
Actin' your shoe size,
Can't even look me in my face,
Can't even look in my eyes,
But that's alright, 'cause when I catch'cha I'ma catch'cha,
And I'll bet'cha never ever ever ever ever ever ever
Tell a lie, run your lip,
Talk about this nigga right chea,
Talk and stuff,
When you're nothin' but bluff,
Hey man you talk too much,
Home boy you never shut up,
You got a big mouth, a big mouth, say what?

[Chorus]
Third Verse [Beelow]:
Hanh what? Hanh boy, you all know me,
You say we related how the Hell could it be?
I never seen ya out my house or at my family cookouts,
When you say you my cousin, what the Hell you talkin' bout?
I'm that balla you wants to be, but your paper ain't long enough,
With that broad you want to be with, but your game ain't strong enough,
Come with that yakkety-yak, 'cause you know I'm a star,
You should spot me when I'm flossin' in a big body car,
You always talkin' that noise,
Actin' hard wit'cha boys,
But you won't even look my way, you know I'm packin' them toys,
Boy, ah-ah, but you be runnin' your mouth,
Boy you talk so much, you talk worse than Bell South,
Now I done hooked up with that tank you best respect it,
see-Murder and Beelow straight flossin' Ballin' Records,
All up in a nigga biz,
Who you think you is?
Talkin' to them people bout to get'cha tail killed, wootay,
Everytime I come round,
You sayin' you want to be down,
But see I know you'z a hater plus a big mouth clown,
You got a big mouth, you can't keep your trap shut,
I guess I gotta close your eyes and seal your lips up

[Chorus] (1/2x)",Big Mouth
Beema Monroe,"[Chorus]
Them whips clean we sliding em' thru the city
Wet candy paint dripping on chrome so pretty
The sun shining this a perfect day to ball
Lined up back to back on the strip wit my dawgs
Got a gallon and a fifth
I'ma sip wit my dawgs
Five-O chilling
They just sitting on the car
We the hottest in the city
Got 400 horses with me
Tell a hater stop playing
Ain't nobody fucking with me
Aiiiii-ght

[Verse 1: Beema Monroe]
I tell em' welcome to my city
Pimps, hoes, saints, dope boys fuck wit me
Whitney
Gone get the donk out the storage
Make a long story short
I'll take yo' porridge
We sliding
Ain't gone be too much speeding
Floating thru my hood all the dope boys speaking
A bossy mulfukka
I'm exactly what they seeking
Show that love then I let them sixteens go to leaking
Hit the strip round seven
Stunt a little that'll waste time
Rearview mirror terrified of the bass line
Boooooom
You hear them outside speakers bout a half mile away
Feeling like a holiday
Aiiii-ght

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Beema Monroe]

Whip cleaner den a mulfukka
From the waxed outside to the seat covers
In the head-rest you looking at Chris Tucker
Money talk, bullshit walk
Broke mulfukkas
White folk, ween born with the money we hunt
So when we finally get it, let a nigga stunt
All we tryna do is vibe and have a lil good time
Maybe sip a lil liquor lil wine
Pass the blunt
In that midnight Beemer with the Florida State tag
Hair did, tatted up, wit a whole lotta ass
Headed to the strip club with a whole lotta cash
In the back surrounded by Haitian flags
Yeen fukking with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Beema Monroe]
We need peace in the hood
Remember when we use to walk the streets in the hood
Not enough money too much beef in the hood
Put them K's up, together we can feast in the hood
No, matter the state
I'm always repping my city
77Deuce, Fort Pierce Florida we winning
I'm grabbing they attention and this only the beginning
Am I sinning dear Lord or you approve of how I'm living
Ain't no time for beefing when you busy getting money
I'm fukking wit my haters
They get touchy when you stunting
(haahh) Bitch youn't wanna run it
Keep revving ya lil' engine
Too funny
Yeen fukking with me

First he loved my accent. How his knees could bend.

But I feel this cake just isn't done.

I feel the West in you, but I, I feel it falling apart too.

You told me, that I was your fantasy yeah
You said that we would practice monogamy
So I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep creeped into the kitchen
And got the remedy it's called the lie detector
I slipped it in his drink I brought it to his bedside
And said take a sip of this and don't think
You won't believe what happened
When he sipped the lie detector
Looked into his eyes
Asked him where you been?
He said it's no surprise
Cause I've been with my ex girl
Why'd you tell me the truth?
He said you wanted to hear the truth
Sometimes I wish I never gave him a detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kind of glad he took the lie detector

Beets Brothers,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams
Beets Brothers,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Before Dark,"Chorus:
You got me thinkin everyday
(your always) on my mind
All the time
You got me thinkin everyday
(your always) on my mind
All the time

Last night when you left me
Suga you've been on my mind
....were special
(mmmm) you're one of a kind
Pretty brown eyes
Please be kind
The day you walked in my life
It was right on time you got me thinkin

Chorus:
You got me thinkin everyday

All the time
You got me thinkin everyday
(your always) on my mind
All the time

It's funny how you got me sittin here
All alone now I'm waitin by the phone
Boy you got me doin things
I've never done before
Baby I must admit it
You know you did it to me
Can't you see how you changed me
24 hours

I want to be the one (so much life)

On the low unless we stop

Cause we won't show it while they're there

What you and I decide to do
Keep it on the low, and
Every night you come on through

About the things that we do

And being good friends is all that they know

They don't even know that you really are my boo
As far as they know

You and I we just real tight, aiight

Me and my step partner
Have kept it on the down low so far
So many times I've slipped up
Almost let my girls know what's up
So I gotta make sure no one else around
So we can get down when you come around
Don't want them around our way

You try to go out of your way, oh
To prove a point to me
That everything's okay
And even you were my mistake
And the love I took from you
Has quickly been replaced

Does she know in the midnight hour
You're callin' me
Should we tell her how you send me flowers
Don't want to play me
Cause when it gets down to it
You can't accept I up and left you
You never thought I'd do it
Now you're settling for second best, oh

I see the little things you do, oh, oh
To try to get me looking like a fool
But she's no exception the rule, no
Too blind to realize that she's just being used

She doesn't know about if I blew up your pagerÃ?
(9-1-1)
And said to pack your things and leave her

You can't accept I up and left you

You'll never find a love that's half as good as mine
So why should I waste time to go there?
Cause if you wanna another ? I don't care
What you do, or who you see
Since I set you free

No, no, no, no...

I can't believe that the magic is gone
You say you're still feeling love, but it's not true
I try to tell you it's all said and done

You say you change, but I'm so sorry baby
I've got one question,what took you so long?
I play for keeps now, and there ain't no maybe
It's hard to tell, so I'll sing you a song,

Bye bye baby, I will see you maybe
Bye bye baby, anywhere somehow
Bye bye baby, someday I'll be waiting
Please don't cry, bye bye

It's been for too long the same sad old story
Don't close your eyes, so you will see the truth
I won't regret what I'm doing,I'm sorry

Beginner,"Wo ich chill da, steh'n Schilder, die sagen
Ich will da keine Labernasen, die mich plagen
Kein Hubba-Bubba von deinem Blubber-Blubber
Geh' und verscheuer Heizdecken auf'm Butter-Kutter
Sorry, kein Bock auf deine Story
Geh' zu 'ner Parkuhr, kost' zwei Mark nur
Ich hab dir nix zu sagen, do hast mich nix zu fragen
Tu' lieber so, als ob ich gar nicht da bin
Ich will nur irgendwo da obensitzen, runter gucken
Ab und zu grüßen, ab und zu spucken
Mit den Schultern zucken bei den Puppen aus'm Werbeclip
Und dem grausamen Ich-will-daß-ich-was-werde-Blick
Mit gelacktem Kompakt-Grinsen
Unter gleich Beknackten nach Kontakt linsen
Wie kann man nur so unfunky tanzen, bitte
Ihr netten, Adretten nervt, wie Junkies I'm Schanzenviertel!
Ich bin nie wieder nett, wenn Nat - King Cole
Nenn' mich Unforgeta-Bo, ich brech die NDW
Das ist die Nette Deutsche Welle, stelle nette Rapper in den Schatten
Die biten wie Ratten, ich bin die Quelle für Raps mit Profil und Charakter
Ich bin nicht Aal-glatt, ich schneid' den Aal ab und schließ' den Saal ab/
In dem ihr nett seid, und wenn ihr jetzt immer noch denkt, daß ihr fett seid
Habt ihr euch so heftig geschnitten, wie 'ne Amputation
Und ohne Beine seid ihr nur noch Arm dran'
Und 'n Stumpen. ihr könnt nicht mal humpeln
Na, sind deine Protesen weg, hast do sie noch nicht gefunden?
Ich hab sie versteckt, ist das nicht nett?
""Nat Turner? Wo?"" der heißt Ted Turner,
Ist in der Vagina von Tina und danach I'm Po
""Mensch Bo! Verarsch' mich nicht immer, sei doch mal nett!""
""My memory's bad hon, I just fuckin' forget""
Wir wollen Blumen brennen seh'n, Sandalen rennen seh'n
Grinsende halbe Hemden flennen seh'n
Eure Karrieren enden seh'n
Eure Style-Rechnung ist nicht aufgegangen, wir kommen, pfänden geh'n!
I rock the house, roll a spliff, Gegenmittel gegen mich gibt's nich'
Gib mir 'n Beat, mein Kopf is' voll ""Pures Gift""
Sind die Augen rot, mach ich blau bis ich schwarz seh'
Lifestyle: Kamikaze, bei mir ' ne Dauerphase
Noch 'ne Frage: was ist geil, geiler, am geilsten?
Prollstyle vom Feinsten, frontal, bleib' locker
Sonst wird das Monster beißen, wie Mike Tyson, is' mir egal
Meine Weste keine von den weissen - und do hast keine Wahl
Mongo-Clicke, Mongo-Attack, do wirst schwitzen wie Kurt Russel in Backdraft
Sobald 'n Freak ""eins, zwo"" in's Mic rappt, burnen alle wack-MCs weg
Durch heiße Ware auf Vinyl, CD und Tapedeck
Sie sind viel zu weit weg, von diesem Level mit Scheißdreck
Darum hat battlen hier kein' Zweck
Erstens ist mein Atem länger, zweitens sind meine Taschen leer,
Drittens: Ich bin so derbe fett, aber der größte Hänger!
Ich lebe um zu lieben, Nette für Intrigen
Schneiden geschwollen labernd und lachend Grimassen, wie Skins Frisen
Poppen morgens auf Kocken, ham' mittags 'n paar Kongresse
Und Abends haun' sie auf Feten lächelnd Kollegen auf die Fresse
Doch nur mit Wörtern, versteht sich, geplant ist jede Gestik
Das Gut-drauf-sein muß gekauft sein
Ihre Parties stimmen heiter, wie 'n Aids-Test positiv
Da's dort nur falsche, gute Laune und nichts großes gibt
Nee, nee, sind solche Typen vor der Bühne, riskier' ich 'ne dicke Lippe
Rappe nicht mehr für Geld, nee, für pikierte Blicke
Wie Bo und Ferris, die die Beginner begleiten und beweisen
Daß die meisten, die rappen nicht reif sind, sondern Pfeifen
Ich scheiß' auf nett, streich es aus'm Wörterbuch,
Verzichte darauf, wenn ich aus'm Duden Wörter buch'
Alle Netten seh'n schlecht aus, sie zu dissen nicht heikel, und wenn
Nehm' ich mir das Recht raus und bring den Scheiß erst recht raus!
Wir wollen Blumen brennen seh'n, Sandalen rennen seh'n
Grinsende halbe Hemden flennen seh'n
Eure Karrieren enden seh'n
Eure Style-Rechnung ist nicht aufgegangen, wir kommen, pfänden geh'n!
Für mich ist nett nix, das Bo is' nicht nix
Jetzt kommt die Nummer 13 von den Mongo-Flash-Tips
Zwei Blunts nebeneinander seh'n aus wie 'n Twix
Wenn Bo cool wie Winter rapt, is' er nur I'm Inter Net!

Ich investier' in die Beginner A.G.
So steigt mein Wortwert, mein Style wirkt doller
Die Fans wollen uns, wie die an der Börse Dollar
HipHop Tracks fallen I'm Kurs, wie uns Ideen ein
So tun wir Mr. HipHop ein' Gefallen und füllen Hallen
In denen wir abstylen ""immer weiter""
Die Karriere sucht 'n Job, als Sprosse in der Tonleiter
Mit Hemd und Schlips nach oben ist kein Clou
Denn klettern ist Sport, brauch ein Paar Turnschuh'
Jeden Tag seh' ich sie, doch sie blicken nicht mehr
""was geht"", schauen nur auf die Uhr, doch ticken nicht mehr
Gefesselt am Schreibtischsessel haut sie nichts vom Hocker
Sie wären gern- doch sind bloß ihre Schrauben locker
Ihr Leben ist verplant, denn sie waren planlos
Wir ham' kein Ziel, aber wir fahren los
Die Beginner als Job, tausend Styles I'm Gepäck
Verträge unterschreib' ich mit'm tag
Die Welt geht kacken, doch vorher word' ich Styles kicken
Und mit den Beats bumsen und mit'm Funk ficken ...
Wir sind am Start und die Welt ist groß
Wir ham' kein Ziel, aber wir fahr'n los
Unser Zug ist abgefahr'n doch wir sitzen drin
Niemand kann ihn stoppen, wir werden weiterrocken ...
Ich verbasse die Masse, indem ich ihr neue Beats verpasse
Krieg' dafür Geld, daß ich auf'm Kiez verprasse
Oder I'm Plattenladen, wo sie Rap Platten haben
Denn nur Rap Platten schützen mich an nassen Tagen
Aus meinen Raps daraus, bau ich mir ein Haus
Gegen Hunger hab' ich einen Kühlschrank voll mit Applaus
Ich seh' die Welt, und sie sieht den Eißfeldt
Habe Spaß nicht nur am Dienstag, penn' aus während ihr Dienst habt
Und komm' mir nicht mit BMW und GTI, Lamborghini und Ferrari
Mit New York Hardcore Rap auf'm Ohr, mit'm Bike, bin ich zwanzigmal so schnell wie die
Immer motiviert durch Unsympathen aller Arten
Die Luft für mich sind, aber Luft, die ich atmen
Muß, denn ich will überleben
Nicht ersticken in dem Mist, den sie ständig reden
Immer hinter mir, Masen von Kollegen
Die, wie ich, die Ärsche der Nation bewegen
Wir leben und rocken und niemand kann uns stoppen
Wir werden aller Popper foppen und die Charts toppen ...
Wir sind am Start und die Welt ist groß
Wir ham' kein Ziel, aber wir fahr'n los
Unser Zug ist abgefahr'n doch wir sitzen drin
Niemand kann ihn stoppen, wir werden weiterrocken ...
Eure Welt glänzt 25 mal in der Sekunde, aber meine Augen sind geschlossen
Elfte Runde und ich flash, bis ich umfall
Flash auch unprall!
Wenn ich die Karstadtwelt stumm schalt'
Nicht um- sondern ausschalt'
Wann immer ich Bock hab', den Mund halt, Bassdrum aus'm Auto rausschallt
Bongblast mit Vollgas in's Gehirn knallt
Selber Drogen kaufen, anstatt Miami Vice gucken
In Gedanken noch jedem Bullen ins Gesicht spucken
Tanz' weder euren Walzer, noch Disco Fox
Ich nick' nur mit dem Kopf zum Rap, der aus der Box kommt
Der JBL-Boom, mit dem ich Nachbarn umlege
Den gute Boxen kennen keine Mietverträge
Ich lebe und liebe die Bilder und ihre Macht
Blinzel' nach einer durchgemachten Nacht in die Sonne
Do willst Wein, Lady? do willst Dinner, Lady?
Wie wär's mit China-Imbiß, a la Beginner; Baby?
Mich scheucht keiner irgendeinen Weg lang
Ich bin Beginner man, irgendwas fang ich immer an ...
Wir sind am Start und die Welt ist groß
Wir ham' kein Ziel, aber wir fahr'n los
Unser Zug ist abgefahr'n doch wir sitzen drin
Niemand kann ihn stoppen, wir werden weiterrocken ...
Sei' doch mal ehrlich, do bist zwar überhaupt nicht locker
Doch ich weiß, tief in dir drin, wärst' do doch auch gerne 'n Rocker
Do ziehst dir doch heimlich auch mal 'ne Daunenjacke an
Und schließt dich ein auf'm Klo und hörst Rap Radio, oder guckst Yo! ...

Beginner,"Tja, ich sag', die Geschichte geht „Es war einmal“
Klein Jan, Klein Dennis und ein Basketball
Vierzehn Jahre alt und ein Haar am Sack
Aber die größten Klappen in der ganzen Stadt
Den Edding in der Tasche, war dauerhaft am taggen
Yo! MTV-Raps auf VHS-Kassetten
Deutschland war grau und die Charts waren schrott
Aber N.W.A and P.E. waren Gott
Auf einer Party haben wir Mardin getroffen
Er rappte Eazy-E und hat Campari gesoffen
Die Chemie stimmte, wir gründeten 'ne Band
Mit 'm Tapedeck, 'n Zettel und 'n Stift und Talent
Rough Beats und Texte mit 'ner Aussage
Der Flow mies, doch die Shows waren herausragend
Braucht nur noch 'n Auto und jemanden, der scratcht
Dann kam DJ Mad und alles war perfekt

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

Ja, genau, Digga, damals, als es kein Schwanz kannte
Ergriffen wir die Chance und die Schanze
Die ersten Demos klangen wie die ersten Demos ah
Und das flora-rote Viertel, es brannte
Hip-Hop und Rap, Digga, waren noch nicht Trendwörter
Sondern Fremdwörter, selbst unter Spex-Lesern
Denn damals gab es keine Juice
Nur ein paar Crews mit dicken Samplern auf den Gepäckträgern
Und wir radelten von Proberaum zu Proberaum
Kein großes Studio, doch dafür einen großen Traum
Die Noten wurden schlechter, die Texte besser
Echt hammer, echt, Mama, ich werd' Rapper!
Und so fuhren wir paar Stündchen
Weiter auf die Jams über Braunschweig nach München
Keine Gage, um sie aufn Kopf zu hauen
Stattdessen Maxis verkaufen aus'm Kofferraum

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

Ja, ich sag', vom Plattenmachen kein bisschen Plan haben
Die erste LP war 'n Gemischtwarenladen
Dub, Crossover, P-Funk, Bossanova
Geschrieben, aufgenommen und gemixt in einem Monat
Zu viel Gedudel, wir wollten wieder Rapshit
Schnell zurück zu drei Mics und zwei Technics
Denn im ganzen Land ging so viel zu der Zeit
Die Sprache lernte rollen und die Beats wurden tight
Und wir waren mittendrin mit 'nem Universal-Deal
Nur Mardin, der ging, denn es wurde ihm zu viel
Keine Ausbildung, wir setzten auf Rap
Bauten unserer Generation 'n fetten Soundtrack
Und als er rauskam, Alter, was da los war
MTV, VIVA, Radio, 'n Bravo-Poster
Kein' Bock, Popstars zu sein
Darum gehen wir zu The Dome, ohne da zu sein, ey ja

So war das früher, doch alles hat ein Ende 
Wo soll ich anfangen?
Das Hip-Hop-Fieber fühlte sich auf einmal krank an
Ne, kein Flash '99 hält auf ewig, mit
Goldenen Platten im goldenen Käfig
Denn scheiß ma' auf Talent oder Stil
Jede Profilneurose bekam 'n Deal
Und dazu noch 'n Starproduzenten
Finanziert von Jamba-Sparabonnenten
Eh, ja, und das Klima wurde kälter
Deswegen machte Jan Urlaub auf Jamaica
Doch ein paar Firmengründungen und Pleiten später
Waren wir wieder angefixt wie Doherty Peter
Ja, dank Just Blaze und den Neptunes
Kam auch sie zurück, die derbste aller Rapcrews
Und die Hamburg-City-Blues-Brothers neu vereint
Schrieben Deutschraps erste Nummer ein

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

„25 years and that's quite a group anniversary!“
„In Hamburg, all the very best, auf Wiedersehen.“",Es war Einmal...
Beginner,"„Hello, children
Hello
Are you ready?
Then we'll begin“

Ey
Hier sind die Beginner, woo
Yeah
Das is' für die alten Zeiten
Für den alten Vibe, den alten Flash
Ein Mixtape wie früher
Gemixt, gecutted, gestyled
Für all die sie sagen: „Ey
Wieso klingt der neue Scheiß nicht wie Bambule?
Und was macht dieser Gzuz Typ da im Video?“
Aber alles cool
Wir haben das ja selber mal gehört
Selber mal gemacht
Und es bringt riesen Spaß
Mit alten Strophen und alten Beats
Eimsbush Stylee
Ah, check das ab
Yo

Was los? Wir sind im Haus heut' Nacht
Haben euch alte Styles mitgebracht
Für alle, die noch mit uns down sind
Und immer wiederkommen, wenn wir unseren Sound bringen

Eizi Eiz - „Das E“
Denyo - „Das D“
Dj Mad am Mix - „Das M“
Und Mister Tropf - „Das T
Und Fidjikris - „Das C“
Und Foxy Music - „Foxy“
Soundsystem

„Did you hear that?“
„Hear what? I don't hear anything unusual“
„A sort of strange haunting music
It's been coming in on a interstellar frequency
But at regular intervals
It's like a message of some kind“

Foxy Music

Chill, (chill), chill, (chill), chill, (chill)
Chill, (chill), chill, (chill), chill, (chill)
Chill, (chill), chill, (chill)

Ja, ich sag
Siehst du das Blau und das Gelb, da der
Siehst du das Blau und das Gelb, da der 
Siehst du das Blau und
Siehst du das Blau und
Siehst du das, siehst du das, siehst du das
Siehst du das Blau und das Gelb, da der Punkt
Der Skunkduft, der dir funkt: es ist Zeit
Breit und weit und breit nur Welt
Und alles wird schön und hübsch, wie ein Bild, es gefällt dir
Cool, jetzt sitze ich am Pool in meinem Liegestuhl
Ich denk, ich bin verwirrt, doch dann bin ich wieder cool
Ja, das gehen wir ruhig an, nur keine Hektik
Denn es erstreckt sich auf einmal
Tiefe Tiefe in mehr Richtungen, als es gibt
Jemand hat sich in diesen Moment verliebt
Meditation entspannt geb' ich das Ruder aus der Hand
Und lass mich treiben auf dem Fluss durch das Traumland
Das Wasser plätschert, funkelt wenn du lachst
Und ich mir fast vor Lachen in die Hose mach'
Hey, die Sonne scheint zurück von der Haut dieser Frau
Die ich anbetungsvoll anschau
Und ich gehe langsam durch die Hektik von heute
Schreite gemächlich durch die rennende Meute
Auf meiner Reise werde ich kurz weise - pralles Ding
Für einen Moment wusste ich worum alles ging

Chillen, alle Leute sind am Chillen
Was geht ab? Wir sind am Chillen
Was geht ab? Ihr seid am Chillen (Chill man, chill)
Die Beginner sind am Chillen 
Platin Martin ist am Chillen 
Tropf am Mix ist am Chillen 
Fidjikris ist am Chillen
(Chill man, ch-ch-chill, chill, chill)

Dynamite
Oh, ah, ja
Ich sag:
Samy Deluxe am Mikrofon, ran am Anfang
Es hört sich krank an, ich will an allen Ufern ankern
Ich finde Anklang, kann man das sagen? Ja, das kann man
Denn ich brauch' mich nicht mehr an alten Zielen festklammern
Andere rappen, doch hören sich an als wenn sie jammern
Außerdem stammeln, weil ihre Zungen im Mund vergammeln
Wir sammeln Inspiration und Energie
Brauchen keine Gewinner nie
Weil wir Gewinner sind, für immer im Wahn
Mit Ideen auf dem Plan, erzählen von Dingen, die wir sahen
Orten an den wir waren, wir rulen wie Dschingis Khan
Ihr könnts nicht ahnen, egal wie hype ihr seid
Zeit für Dennis und Dynamite Deluxe, a'ight
Samy Deluxe ist Dichter und Verfasser
Dj Dynamite sorgt für den Ghettoblaster
Vinyl bis Meister, aber kein Scheibenkleister
Und Dennis Lisk ist zweiter, nicht dritter sondern dreister
Hamburgs neues Tempo, nichts für Popel
Wir fahren Ford und nicht Opel
Und zwar mit Rap-Mucke, weiß ich nicht weiter
Ist die Glotze Therapeut, wenn ich Rap gucke
Neue Styles müssen so dringend her wie andere auf Toilette
Wenn sie mich sehen und sich ins Hemd pissen, jede Wette
Weil, 'ne gute Freestyle-Kür gehört zu mir
Wie dein Name an die Tür oder an die Wand
Spieglein, wer ist der schönste Rapper im Land? Du
Wie ist mein Name? Dennis von der AB-Crew
Ich hör nicht auf, und besonders nicht auf andere
Flieg' mit den Beats von Dynamite, meilenweit
Und weiß nicht ob ich lande
Und ob, und wenn nur damit ich tanke
Erober alle Herzen im Sturm und Samy schießt die Flanke
Die Tore fallen und wir steigen, die Beats sind fetter
Die Underground-Chart-Trendsetter

Wir gehen weiter und poppern auf den Zeiger
Die Underground-Chart-Trend-Setter
Der Beat ist fetter
Chartleader der Styleliga
Der Underground setzt den Trend der Trend-Setter bis ihn jeder kennt

Wir gehen weiter und poppern auf den Zeiger

Ich komm in der Tür, du fragst wofür
Nun ja, weil ich das Verlangen nach Befriedigung verspür
Rühr die Chemie an, die euch zum zuhören verführt
Ehre wem Ehre gebührt, also mir
Hier, nimm dies und zeig es allen MCs
Damit sie wissen wo dieser neue Einfluss herfließt
Hamburg City
Spuhl das Tape zurück bis es zu Ende ist
Und wende es, bis es heiß ist
Du hörst, dass dies kein Scheiß ist
Und wenn der Sound allein noch kein Beweis ist
Dann lass die Texte sacken, bis auf den Grund deines Geistes
Und verdau sie, spür wie weit wir den anderen voraus sind
Ohne Pausen, stylen bis ins nächste Jahrtausend
Wir gehen weiter
So ist es, also friss es, miss es mit anderen Raps
Und dann küss es, lieb es und nimm es, find es
Cool ich könnte wetten, dass du nicht denkst, dass es dünn ist
Weil es fett ist, keck is', deswegen tagg es an die Wand und vergiss
Niemals wer der Mac ist, Dennis hilft wie Cannabis
Rap ist mein Leben, weil er viel wert ist
Cooler Rap mit Eis serviert wird
Und heiß begehrt ist, ha

Wir gehen weiter und poppern auf den Zeiger
Die Underground-Chart-Trend-Setter

Boba Ffett
Boba Ffett
Boba Ffett
Boba Ffett
King of this B-Boy thing

Ja, ich sag:
Wie geht das da? Liga-mäßig an den Start
Es ist Boba Ffett, der Hanseat, mit der Hanse-Art
Ich koche Lachs, während in deinen Töpfen Pansen gart
Und komme so cool, da frieren Truck Stops die Fransen hart
Alle wollen wissen warum gegen mich keiner 'ne Chance hat
Ich hab die Mongos, wo sich um andere 'n Haufen Transen schart
Fette Beats und Daunenjacken bevor es Helly Hansen gab
Und ihr Teenies in deutschen Serien zu Hip-Hop tanzen saht
Bevor ich Styles kicke, such ich den Raum nach Wanzen ab
Wann ist Schluss mit den Pirates, den Bitern und dem ganzen Pack?
Ich gebe mich ungern mit Behörden und Bilanzen ab
Weil ich ihre Regeln so wie Dieter Bohlen Emanzen mag
Mache mich lieber mit Blüten von illegalen Pflanzen platt
Mache Beats, hoffe, dass das mit den Finanzen klappt
Warte von meinen Mongos die Resonanzen ab
Bis das Presswerk einen neuen Burner in Vinyl zu stanzen hat

Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, mach Rock 'n' Roll

Was los?
Hör auf mit Algebra, weil ich auf Plus und Minus scheiß
Und komm zu mir, wenn deine Doktorarbeit Sinus heißt
Bist du Analphabet, so wird Bass buchstabiert
Indem man Sub addiert und Höhen subtrahiert
Mks sind nicht geerdet, wenn Mad geschickt scratcht
Und Matze macht mit dem Gekratze dann den Mix fett
Und Boba hat 'n Kuchen und tausend fitte Tracks
Ich will mehr Bass, die Höhen leise und die Mitten weg
Hör in jeder Stadt Bass, von hier bis Kapstadt
Und in Bagdad les' ich halt 'n Bass-Fachblatt
Mein Style hat Karma, weil ausgepfeilte Wertarbeit
Nicht eng, wie 'n Bahnabteil, immer sechzig Hz dabei
Früher war vieles Spaß heute nehmen's viele ernst
Doch auch du willst was, egal für welchen Stil du schwärmst
Solang ihr Bass wollt werd' ich Bass haben
Und meiner der wird brummen, wie 'n Fernkraftwagen

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? (Yes, yes Foxy Music)
Lass das As, mach Rock 'n' Roll

Yo, heute ist mir kalt, heute klagen Nachbarn
Denn mein Zimmer hält nix anderes, als 'n Bass warm
Ich will im Bass baden, der muss brummen, wie Lastwagen
Dünne Sounds nerven wie Bullen die nach 'm Pass fragen
Ich kick statt Battle Rhymes Schlagzeilen in die Welt
Sechzig Hz zerbrechen nicht und wenn die Teeniewelt
Die meinen, der Garten Eden sei 'n großer Blumentopf
Ich brauch im doppelsiebten Himmel bloß 'ne Boombox
Das analoge Paradies ist heute ganz nah
Und stehst du nicht so auf Peace, ist Bass 'n Panzer
Wenn ich nach Sounds wühl, chill ich im Fuchsbau
Bis man es im Bauch fühlt und der Sound im Club taugt
Weil Bass ist golden, wie das M wenn du in Burger beißt
Doch magst du Metal, geh bellen, kack auf 'n Bürgersteig
Es soll nicht quietschen, wie Enten oder Walgesang
Ich will Basswellen im Wellenbad oder am Badestrand

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag krass das, hier kommt Platin Martin
Verlorene Strophe von „Da geht was“

Anschaffung vom Chemiekasten hat sich gelohnt
Bei mir im Keller könnt ihr sehen, ich hab mich zehn mal geklont
Jetzt kick' ich Rhymes wie 'n Fußballteam jetzt
Werden Rapjunkies auf keinen Fall clean, denn jetzt kommen Raps
Die kitzeln wie erste Küsse in Küstennähe
Kühl flüstern wie der Wind, wenn ich an Küsten gehe
Knisternde Kopfhaut zehntausend Volt Kurzschluss
Wie 'n Colt kurz nach dem Schuss, atme ich Rauch aus
Bin auch raus, wenn das Gas aus ist
Im Haus ist Martin, der langsamer als der Tunnel Staus ist
Reim für uns, die wirken wie die Siebziger
Alles wird freier und spritziger und Bob Marley gib's wieder
Ey gib's das? (Ja, man) Das heißt, da geht was
Ihr hört Bass und seht was die Wände zum vibrieren bringt
So krass wie wir klingen, kann es nicht gut gehen
Wir sehen uns dann den Südjemen beim Training

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass

This is fantastic
(Foxy Music)
Oh, this is terrific

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Ja
Ich spreche von früher in höheren Tönen, als wie mit Helium
Denn Hip-Hop, wie ich es kannte, starb mit dem neuen Millennium
Ursache war die Masse und an der war ich mit schuld
Sie gab Hip-Hop 'ne Leine und 'n Maulkorb wie 'n Pitbull
Machte Rap in Deutschland zu Deutschland im Rappen
Und an der Stelle bin ich draußen, denn ich find' Deutschland nicht fett, ne!
Soll doch der ganze uninteressante Sauhaufen allein weiter im Kreis
Und irgendwann dann in's Aus laufen
Wir machen uns selber kaputt, ich kann's nicht länger hören
Fordert man den Verlust der Freiheit mit enger Stirn
Anstatt immer was zu meckern sollte man Liebe finden
Und Paläste bekriegen und Dritten Frieden wünschen
Das Land ist fade und macht durstig nach Leben
Und heutzutage ist Vorsicht geboten für jeden
Denn Konkurrenz ist gut, aber der Flash geht vor
Statt Allüren hab' ich Stahltüren für mein Rhymebook im Tresor
Auch wenn der Beat mich hart begleitet, bleib' ich zart beseidet
So wird er vom Gespür für Flows smart verkleidet
Ich mach' meinen Kram und meide den Heiligenschein
All der Scharlatane in den eigenen Reihen

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Das ganze Feinde-Gelaber ist nicht bloß eine Macke
Und nicht der Spaß an der Sache der Maßstab einer Platte
Was denn? Sich Beulen für Fame und heulende Sirenen
Und bloß kleine Kinder als Zeugen dieser Themen?
Ich find' das unangenehm
Wird nur noch runtergesehen und muss für Frieden in unseren Szenen Wunder geschehen?
Was muss passieren, bis die meisten begreifen
Dass wir uns alle nur noch peinlich verhalten?
Zu dumm, dass mit der Masse nicht auch die Klasse zunahm
Doch die wenigen guten Acts waren schon da, als der Boom kam
Dafür nerven Tausende aus der Newcomer-Rubrik 
Mit 'ner SP-12, aber kein Plan von der Musik, nee
Wenn real bedeutet immer den gleichen Scheiß zu labern
Und um den Beat zu machen nur zwei Minuten Zeit zu haben
Muss ich sagen: Okay, dann bin ich's eben nicht
Denn für mich ist Qualität und der Flash wesentlich
Und an euch Pisser mit weniger Weitsicht, als 'n Blinder hat
Euer Kinderkack macht mich wahnsinnig wie Rinderhack
Jeder Scheiß wird gesigned, Majors kriegen Torschlusspanik
Doch ohne Sellout aus Hamburg bekämen ihr diesen Vorschuss gar nicht

„Eich ein Mikro
Eich ein Mikro
Eich ein Mikro und es verliert seine Seele
Das ist der Grund, warum ich meinen Weg wähle“

Ich steh plus fünf auf der Gästeliste, doch mein Gott
Ich komm allein, meine Freunde haben keinen Bock
Doch ich hab Hunger und auf dem Facebook-Flyer war die Rede
Davon, dass es Fingerfood auf deiner Releaseparty gäbe
Und nun lass ich mich tatsächlich, wenn auch widerwillig
Für paar Spieße Saku-Chicken auf ner Party blicken
Und lass es über mich ergehen, das Gedresche all der Phrasen
Und diese „Wann kommt 'n endlich das neue Album?“-Fragen
Und du fragst mich, wie es Jan geht?
Ich frage mich, was dich das angeht
Ich will hier weg, ich muss pissen und dein Telefon klingelt
Doch ich warte vergebens, dass du Spacken endlich rangehst
Ne, ich war noch nie in Kaiserlautern
Und bagger' mit dir jetzt auch keine heißen Frauen an
Und nein, es gibt keine zweite Staffel bei Vox
Und ich war auch noch nie auf deinem supergeilen Blog
Und ja die Hose, ist ganz cool
Ne, die ist von Cowes, sorry Digga, ich muss los
Ne, ich bin heute einfach nur nicht so gut drauf
Ja, cool - Ja genau, du mich auch

Ich hab kein' Bock, so sieht es aus
Ich bleib stumm, doch leider nicht taub, Typ
Ich hab kein' Bock, auf all das Gelaber
Ohne Punkt, ohne Komma, kein wenn, kein aber, kein Bock

Kein wenn, kein aber
Kein wenn, kein aber, kein Bock
Kein wenn, kein aber
Kein wenn, kein aber, kein

Ich sage, ich stopfe hundert Kilo Knoblauch in mich rein
Einfach nur damit ich stinke wie ein Schwein
So halt ich mir die Labernasen auf Distanz
Und habe meine wohlverdiente Ruhe, wenn ich tanz'
Und will ich mal shoppen gehen, ungestört
Schmier ich mir 'n bisschen Kacke meiner Tochter auf mein Shirt
Dann denken sie vielleicht: „Ey, Alter, der hat 'nen Schaden“
Doch wenigstens traut sich keiner mich nach 'nem Foto zu fragen

Ich hab kein' Bock, so sieht es aus
Ich bleib stumm, doch leider nicht taub, Typ
Ich hab kein' Bock, auf all das Gelaber

Ne, kein wenn, kein aber, kein Bock
Kein wenn, kein aber, ne, man
Kein wenn, kein aber, kein' Bock
Kein wenn, kein aber
Sorry, kein Bock auf deine Story
Geh zu 'ner Parkuhr, kostet zwei Mark nur
Sorry, kein Bock auf deine Story
Geh zu 'ner Parkuhr, kostet zwei Mark nur
Yeah

Ye-ye-yeow
Hokuspokus Abrakadabra und dann dreimal schwarzer Kater
So zaubern wir neue Schlager
Und burnen alles was da war
Doch nicht a lá Tütata
Mehr wie 'n Jaguar im Lada
Was eh wie Kloßbrühe klar war
Weil für Hits haben wir 'ne Ader
Das ist das Mongo-Geschwader
Zusammen sind wir unschlagbar
So rough wie Meinhoff und Baader
Hart wie Keule von Nana
Für Sauberdeutschland das Drama
Dreizehner mit 'ner Sparvar
Respekt an alle Train-Maler
Auf Bullen mach ich das Lama

Booyaka! Ich komm mit mehr Auswahl als 'n Supermarkt
Mich burnen ist 'ne haarige Angelegenheit wie 'n Kampf mit Chewbacca
Ooolala, cooler Loop, jetzt geht's rund wie Hulahoop
Ich kick Battle-Raps wie Hacky Sacks, wenn ich MCs untersuch'
Diagnose: Größenwahn im fortgeschrittenen Stadium
Ich komm bei eurer Party rum, mit Ideen krank wie Parkinson
Ihr werdet bloßgestellt, so dass auch trotz Gürtel die Hose fällt
Bei eurer Show hat Flow gefehlt, heute geht ihr mal ohne Geld

Hamburg City macht den Markt klar
Mit Buback, Eimsbush, Yo Mama
So fleißig wie die Japaner
Und täglich werden wir larger
Wenn da 'n Jam letztes Jahr war
Wo nix aus Hamburg am Start war
War's wie Jimi ohne Wah-Wah
Oder Schimi ohne Parka

Ahn das mal! Wir bringen frischen Flavor wie Zahnpasta
Team Eimsbush mit Styles einer andern Art in den nächsten Jahren am Start
Tropf und ich schon mehr Gras verbrannt, als jeder Rastamann
Ihr Typen rappt just for fun? Es hört sich unfassbar an!

Ey, das ist das Derbste

Was soll der Scheiß, eure Songs sind Psychoterror wie 'n Poltergeist
Und erst seitdem ich sie kenn', weiß ich wirklich was Folter heißt
Niveaulos, doch wir bringen Rap höher als ein Pilot muss
Dreihundertsechzig Grad rund wie 'n Globus, wieso bloß

Ey, Alder
Die meisten rappen so lala
Die Beats sind süchtig nach mager
Mann und um solche Versager
Macht man dann so 'n großes Trara
Scheiß auf das ganze Theater
Wie hoch der Promoetat war
Style ist unbezahlbar
Und ohne bist du nur AA
Ich bin ein Vinylliebhaber
Und du ein CD-Jasager
Ich sample gern Jamaikaner
Du samplest Hannoveraner
Mein Rap ist derbe, der Knaller
Du rappst schlechter als dein Vadder
Ich hab Fans im Promilager
Deine haben noch nicht mal Schamhaar

Was ist los? Ihr Typen meint ihr kickt krasse Flows?
Ihr macht euch größer als ihr seid, wie Leute mit Buffalos
Und sowas geht auf keinen Fall klar, frag mal MC B
Hier kommt Samy D. Mit mehr Boo-Yah als die Family!

Ey, das ist das Derbste

Foxy Music

Ja, yeah
Wir können alle einpacken und nach Hause gehen
Denn für Rap gibt's 'ne App auch auf PC
Jetzt kriegt jeder 'n paar Mausklicks und umsonst
Ein komplettes Heimstudio mit Ausblick auf die Bronx
Ausgerüstet mit 'nem digitalen Beatknopf
Der alle Sytles liefert, von Lil' John bis Pete Rock
Und dank dem Spitterlyzer kann der Enkel mit der Oma
In Sekunde schnell rappen, sowie Redman und J Hova
Ja, ihr lacht, doch ihr wisst, dass ich recht hab
Da jeder Hans oder Franz heute Rap macht
Und ich warte, wo sind die Unikate
Die Suche bleibt vergebens, wie die, nach der Bundeslage
Denn alle klingen irgendwie gleich
Haben keine Ideen und schielen nur über den Teich
Kochen nach fremden Rezepten, wie 'n Hobbykoch
Machen Mucke nich' im Studio, sonder im Copyshop

Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt rappen wie ich?
Deluxemäßig flowen, Styles kicken wie ich?
Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt schreiben wie ich?
Die Leute live rocken, nur oft bleiben sie nicht
Ich sag: Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt rappen wie ich?
Deluxemäßig flowen, Styles kicken wie ich?
Wie jetzt? Heutzutage will jeder mitspielen
Mcen und DJen, nur leider geht da nich' viel (ja, ja)

Hör' mir zu Digga, ahnma
Ich spitte seit ich rauskam aus meiner Mama
Damals konntest du uns noch zu siebt sehen
Dann kam die erste LP, ich war siebzehn
Rap noch in Kinderschuhen, Größe höchstens zwanzig
Danach der Beginner-Boom, ich war höchstens zwanzig
Eins, Zwo Mikrofon-Check
Und vor der Bühne plötzlich mehr als höchstens zwanzig
Jetzt gibt es Gangsterrap, Hipsterrap und die OGs
Dicker Rentner in der Trotzphase
Erzähl mir nicht es herrschen kalte dunkle Zeiten
Jammer mich nicht voll, Digga, Daunjacke Rotznase
Alles ist gut, wie es ist
Alter Fuchs, neues Fell, dicke Trommeln in mei'm Ohr
Hier hinter'm point of no return
Auf halber Strecke zwischen weißt du noch und stell dir vor

Ich sag: Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt rappen wie ich?

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht tust du's wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht kommt es wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr

Ja, ja, ich werde nie mehr glauben, alles hält für immer
Ausgenommen sind die Rolling Stones und die Beginner
Ansonsten geht alles zu Ende - wie uns die Geschichte zeigt
Checkt Eimsbush, Harald Schmidt und Lipton Ice
Und immer nur das Gute, das Böse stirbt nicht
Checkt BMG, Beckmann und Eistee-Pfirsich
Am Ende bleiben nur die Sachen, die ich öde finde
Weil alle schönen Dinge, irgendwann flöten gingen
Aber warum, ich kriegs echt nich gerafft?
Gibt es da 'ne Freimaurerloge für schlechten Geschmack?
Entertainmenttripplesixer, die alles töten was Spaß macht
Gesponsert von Sat1 und McDonalds und Karstadt
Darf ich wegen denen nie mehr Aaliyah sehen
Doch auf allen Kanälen läuft Shania Twain
Spielen sie mit dem Showbiz wie mit Playmobil
Schickt 'n Jigga in Rente, macht 'n Jacko pädophil
Ich sag, jemand muss sie stoppen, aber ich kann es nicht
Denn sie kennen meine Stimme und sie kennen mein Gesicht, ja

Ah, yo, ah, yo, Digga
Ich hab noch nie wirklich gewusst, weshalb ich eigentlich lebe
Und wie es wär', wenn es das Leben und all die Scheiße nich' gäbe
Doch über solche Dinge, wie: „Wieso sind wir hier?“
Werd ich nie mehr in grellen Klassenzimmern philosophiern
Nie mehr morgens zwischen übereifrigen Kindern sitzen
Die beim sich zu Wort melden, dumm mit dem Finger schnippen
Das Gefühl haben, dass ich vor Mathe-Tests hatte
Das Gefühl der Kopf is 'ne kaputte Festplatte
Ja, es gibt Zeiten, denen muss ich die rote Karte zeigen:
Zeiten mit wenig Spaß und ohne Schokoladenseiten
Wie jene als schicke Anti-Fa mit Läuse und Krätze
Als ich im Alles-ist-scheiße-Style Häuser besetzte
Nach dem Motto „Hauptsache Anti“, doch gar nichts checken
Gingen wir gegen das System vegetarisch essen
Was war ich nich damals für 'nen derber Spinner
Dennoch sind es Zeiten, an die ich mich gern erinner'

Ja, der eine kommt von da, wo sie Hosen aus Leder tragen
Der andere aus der Stadt, aus der die Attentäter kamen
Der dritte von kommt da, wo hm, naja aus Bremerhaven
Und zusammen machen sie Alarm wie 'n Peterwagen
Moment mal, was erzählst du da den Leuten bloß Lederhosen?
Die sind viel zu eng für mich wegen meinen mega Hoden
Man verarscht mich deshalb auch, ich würd' in einer Gegend wohnen
Wo Militärs Versuche machen und Radioaktivität erproben
Ey yo, du meinst, dein Leben mit großen Hoden wär schwer
Mein Pimmel ist zwei Zentimeter vom Boden entfernt
Ja man, ich werde schreien: „Lobet den Herrn“
Wenn sie dreibeinige Hosen zur Mode erklären
Ja ja, mach du nur Witze, doch für mich ist es ein Grundproblem
Meine Bowlingkugeln machen mir des Leben unbequem
Schwimmen, Dicker, ist nicht, denn sonst würd' ich untergehen
Wie viele Kilo wiegen die denn so? So circa hundertzehn!
Mein Lieber, du bist nicht allein mit den Problemen
Mich nennen sie doch auch das Superdildophänomen
Muss immer Großraumtaxi fahren und kann nie die Metro nehmen
Und brauche riesige Kondome aus Neopren

Kauft euch alle mal Boote, denn ich muss piseln, Leute
Mit meiner Riesenkeule, größer als die Siegessäule
Scheiße man, damit kriegst du sicher viele Bräute
Ne, die sind alle geplatzt wie Friedensträume
Dicker, ich dachte fette Eier wären bei Frauen 'e geile Taktik
Der Abstand zwischen meinen Knien neun Meter dreiundachtzig
Deshalb wundert's mich auch, dass ich niemals eine abkrieg
Wenn ich charmant am Lächeln vor ihnen auf meinem Sack sitz'
Seit dem elften September leb' ich in Angst
Vielleicht stürzen die auch Flugzeuge auf meinen Schwanz
Darum, seh ich was Verdächtiges in meiner Reichweite
Dann gibt 's 'ne Breitseite mit meiner Fleischpeitsche

Ey, woher hast du diese Nikes, Eizi?
Ich wusste gar nicht, dass es die auch in weiß gibt
Du sammelst schon seit vielen Jahren so fleißig
Wie viel Paare hast du? Neunhundertdreißig?

Ich komme raus aus dem Haus, schrei': „Yeah“
An meinen Füßen, da sind neue Nike Air
Alle wollen wissen: „Digga, wo hast du die her?“
Ich krieg nie genug, Digga, ich will immer mehr
Air Max und Dunks in meinem Schrank
Denn ich bring meine Kohle lieber nicht zur Bank
Ich krieg nie genug, Digga, ich will immer mehr
Alle wollen wissen: „Digga, wo hast du die her?“

Ich sag: „Falls es noch nicht jeder weiß
Ich rocke Air Max, denn die sind der Scheiß“
90er, 1er oder auch Lites
Aus Hongkong und London und nicht von Snipes
Mein Ebay-Account, der läuft heiß
Ich kauf sie mir doppelt, weil ein Paar nicht reicht
Hemden und Hosen, die sitzen jetzt tight
Doch an den Füßen, der Air Max, der bleibt

Voll erwischt, du Fisch zappelst am Haken
Heute Nacht wirst du im Zelt vor'm Plattenladen warten
Dabei ein Radio, falls es nochmal wiederkommt
Spontanes Desinteresse an all den anderen Liedern prompt
Die alle gleich aussehen und zu viel Schminke nehmen
Aus fünfzig Wörtern wählen, um das gleiche zu erzählen
Mit Schönheitsoperationen an digitalen Konsolen
Stylemäßig immer wieder gut beraten von Polen
Für dich gibt's nur noch eins und sonst keins
Und hält jemand nicht deins für Nummer eins
Siehst du rot, wie Heinz und sperrst ihn ein
Quälst ihn mit Simple Minds, bis er weint

Das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe
Das ist Liebe auf den ersten Kick
Nichtmal Drum 'n' Bass hält jetzt mit deinem Herzen mit
Unser Beat hat „Boom“ gemacht (Unser Beat hat „Boom“ gemacht)
Und es hat „Zoom“ gemacht

Hast du im Leben nix in Petto, ist alles Ghetto
Das heißt Glück brutto und Frust netto
Und im Gesicht' 'n Tränentattoo, ey, dann wird's Zeit für Musik
Weil dann tanzt du, und fliegst durch die Plattenboutique
Und ist deine Freundin weg, dass heißt deine Ex
Ist der Griff zum lieben Lied der Beginner dein Reflex
Nicht mehr Seiten - sondern Sprünge auf der Platte
Komm vor, bleib' entspannt, kauf 'ne Neue, is' doch Latte
Und sieht dein Leben manchmal doof aus
Mach's wie ich, hol' mein' Philosoph 'raus
Schreib 'n Text, komm dann groß raus
Du bist in mich verschossen, mein Pfeil hat dich getroffen
Nun bist du im Beginner-Rausch, früher warst du besoffen
Von zu vielen Produzenten, denn egal, wie sie's schrauben
Nur dünne Tracks und Rap und Pipi in den Augen
Deswegen drück ich selten auf die Tränendrüse
Während ich in den Charts Stehen übe

Der Mond ist unsre Sonne
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ah, yo
Neben mir den Sohn im Bett, über mir den Mond in Sicht
Hinter mir ein harter Tag, aufzubleiben, heut' lohnt es sich
Nachts vermiss' ich Sonne, doch Tags vermiss' Fairplay
Denn leb' ich nachts, heb ich ab wie Britisch Airways, Mensch
Dann hab ich mehr Ideen als 'n ganzes Patentamt
Mit Raps vom Derbsten und brennenden Kerzen am Adventskranz
Und hab statt Bock auf 'n Bett, Bock auf Rap, während ich wachliege
Wieder aufsteh', den Sound aufdreh' und den Krach liebe
Wir sind keine Machtmenschen, wir sind Nachtmenschen
Wir wollen uns und euch für den nächsten Tag Kraft spenden
Das hat wenig zu tun mit Saufen gehen und Party machen
Morgenstund' hat Gold im Mund, doch Abendstund' macht Platinplatten
Und während der Mond scheint wie die Sonne
Schmeiß ich den Müll von tagsüber einfach rein in die Tonne
Ich schmied 'nen Plan, während ich mir von morgen 'n Bild mache
Leo in den Arm wie früher mit 'ner Milchflasche
Die Große zur Schule bringen, den Kleinen in den Kindergarten
Und danach 'n paar Stunden für meine Beginner haben
Ich freu mich drauf, während meine Frau schläft und ich Texte schreib'
Dennoch bleib' ich wach bis die Sonne aufgeht wie Blätterteig

Der Mond ist unsre Sonne
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ich sag: „Wenn die Sonne unter und der Mond aufgeht
Das ist der Moment, wo Eizi Eiz auflebt“
Und rausgeht mit dem Fahrrad durch sein Viertel cruist
Denn Eimsbüttel ist es am schönsten, wenn Eimsbüttel ruht
Wenn alle schlafen ,die Penner und die Millionäre
Die Straßen leer wie bei Küblböck die Kinosäle
Oh ja man, ich mag es genau so
Alles lautlos und keine Autos
Freie Fahrt für den Typ aufm Rad
Mit dem iPod am Start, Volume auf Anschlag
Bergab, vierspurig, ich fahr' Schlangenlinien
So kann es weitergehen, von mir aus bis nach Argentinien
Frische Luft um die Ohren, die den Kopf reinigt
Darum ist mir jede Nacht wie ein Gott heilig
Denn nur zu so unchristlichen Zeiten
Kann ich stylen und feilen an Meilensteinen, ja

Der Mond ist unsere Sonne (ja, mann)
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ne man, mehr nicht
Und auch wenn er sich versteckt hält
Wer denn?
Hinter Wolken und Beton
Ach ja, der Mond, ich bin stoned
Dann wird er immer für uns dasein
Oh ja, bis die Morgensonne kommt

Beginner,"Ah wie ich in den Seilen häng
Letzte Nacht war ich ziemlich peinlich denn
Aus meinem Mund kam nix außer Müll
Und ich hab mehr Kohle verbrannt als'n Grill

Ich würd mich gern wegzaubern Abrakadabra
Fuck, wieder so 'n rabenschwarzer Kater
Gestern noch Superman, heute Drach-man
Der wie 'n Scheintoter in sei'm Bett abhängt
Und ich hasse diesen Tag später
Wenn man 'nen Helm hat wie Darth Vader
Game Over, Schach-Matt, Durchfall, Kopfschmerz
Mann, ich fühl mich Asbach Uralt
Doch wen wundert's nach 50 Kurzen
Ich geh auf Klo nochmal gründlich furzen
Und würd' mein Elend gern vertuschen
Doch es dampft aus meinen Poren selbst nach einer Stunde duschen
Und jedermann riecht es, jedermann sieht's
Ich seh aus wie'n Obdachloser mit Elefantitis
Der Herr der Augenringe, müde und allein
Bis es nächste Woche wieder heißt einer geht noch rein!

Gestern war ich blau, heute seh' ich schwarz
Versteck mich im Bett
Denn so voll wie ich war
So leer bin ich jetzt
Bewege mich träge durch eigenen Nebel
Kein Wind für die Segel und immernoch Pegel
Denn so voll wie ich war
So leer bin ich jetzt

Ich wach auf, oder so ähnlich
Seh' nix, die Augen krustig und klebrig
Fühl mich eklig, hab Angst ich übergeb' mich
Dreh' mich um und schlaf' noch ein wenig
Aber geht nicht, denn in meinem Schädel 
Spielt Lars Ulrich Schlagzeug und ich hab noch Pegel
Und ist das Vogelzwitschern oder Lungenpfeifen
Rihanna kann sich in dem Pelz auf meiner Zunge kleiden
Nie mehr Alkohol, wirklich, das schwör' ich
Mein Körper fühlt sich an wie Dresden '45
Und wenn du dich im Club bis 7 vergnügst
Hast du Karl Dall auf Crack, der dich im Spiegel begrüßt
Mir egal ich werd' heut eh nicht mehr rausgehen
Nur noch vom Bett zum Kühlschrank zur Couch gehen
Und dann hock ich da und kau auf meinem Zwieback
Roll mich in die Decke und denke, dass mich keiner lieb hat?

Zurück aus der Main-Steinzeit
Ah, ihr Einzeller
Hol den alten Jahrgang aus dem Weinkeller
Atzen pfeiffen es von den Dächern
Hamburg kommt wieder mit dicken Brettern
Ja ich hab hier ein bisschen Funk Mukke
Und feier gehr mit jeder Randgruppe
Komm wir machen Montag zu Freitag
Auch wenn ich eigentlich keine Zeit hab'
Ne, weil ich noch 'n Termin habe
Mit 'nem Streichholz und 'ner Benzinlache

Check wie ich und mein Companion
Hier mal eben ganz nonchalant
Mit einer dicken fetten Bombe kommen
Schwachsinn erzählen wie der Postillon
Wir machen Kunst so wie Joseph Beuys
Den kennt ihr nicht, denn ihr seit doofe Toys
Hier kommen die Typen mit dem dopen Zeug
Also was ist den bitteschön los bei euch
Und ich sag
Ah, gib mir noch mehr von dem funky Sound
Denn ich lieb ihn so sehr und ich will mit dem Arsch wackeln und das nicht allein'
Also häng doch bitte all die coolen Chicks da rein
Und ich sag
Ah, gib mir noch mehr von dem funky Scheiß denn ich lieb ihn so sehr
Ja man es juckt mich nicht wenns nicht funky ist

Weil ich wie üblich nicht übrig hab
Und es mir über dem Durchschnitt gemütlich mach'
Ribéry deutscher Meisterflow
Und 'ne Familenpackung Eigenlob
Was will den dieser selbstverliebte Arsch
Doch Nummer Eins ist grad' gesteigen wegen diesem Part, und dich sag
Ah, gib mir noch mehr von dem funky Sound
Denn ich lieb ihn so sehr und eure Deutschrapbeats sind wie Marschmusik
Aber ich, ich will schüttel-deinen-Arsch-Musik und ich sag
Ah, gib mir noch mehr von dem funky Scheiß denn ich lieb ihn so sehr
Und wenn ich durch die Straßen geh' seh ich rechts und links

Die Jacke ist aus Leder, die Hose sind aus Cord
Hamburg ist der Ort, nicht irgend so ein Dorf
Und wenn ich auf Deutsch rappe, dann tu' ich das wegen Torch
Yacka yacka yau, ich rocke hier die Show
Und deine Triple-Reime interessieren keine Sau
Sogar deine Frau sie tanzt und sagt: „Wow!“

Ich und meine Gang, wir kommen von den Jams
Freestylen, Hasch rauchen, auf dem Boden pennen

Ah, ich komm' in Neoprenanzug und Krawatte
Sinuswellen reiten, Urlaub im Club
Maximaler Pegel, die Band mit dem Fuchsschwanz
Verteilt 'ne Schelle und bekommt dafür 'ne Kusshand (yeah)
Ja, die Frauen freuen sich tierisch unser Sound klingt karibisch
Dein Sound klingt nach Russland

(Yo) Ey, die Beginner sind im Haus, Handschlag, Faust
Die Klamotten fresh - Sonnenbrille auf
Den Sound in uns'rer Cloud, den pumpen alle laut
Und die Drums sind so trocken wie die Gags und die Haut
Yippie yippie yeah, ich habe einen im Tee
Und schmiere meine Popel an einen BMW
Bei Schnee sag' ich „Ne!“, und rolle OCB
Ja, und wenn mir nichts mehr einfällt, zitier' ich Thomas D
Ich bring 'ne Menge Schellen und alle sind am schreien
Weil wenn der Bass kommt, die Sonne immer scheint
Du scheißt auf Politik, aber merk dir bitte eins
Monsanto ist böse, Monsanto ist der Feind

Und ich heb' ab und fliege
Dein Sound sät Hass, mein Sound erntet Liebe
Ah, brennende Leidenschaft, jede meiner Rap-Strophen

All of the ladies in the house tonight

Wenn eure Mundwinkel hoch geht
Dann ist die Welt wieder so schön
Und dann ist alles, was ist und was war
Auf einmal so vollkommen egal

Ja!
Für alle Töchter, alle Mütter, alle Omas
Von der Elbe bis runter zum Amazonas
Egal, ob fromme Zeuginnen Jehovas
Kassiererin des Jahres oder Playmate des Monats
In Bagdad mit Highheels auf'm Klapprad
Oder in Cottbus im Porsche mit Kopftuch
Für all meine Diven mit 'nem Drama
Engel in Kik oder Teufel in Prada
Kernphysik- oder Straßenabitur
Die Welt verändern wollen oder nur die Frisur
Das ist für all die zauberhaften vier Milliarden
Denn euer Lächeln, das ist alles, was wir haben

Für die Mami mit dem Schreihals in der Babykarre
Und für die Mami mit der dreihalsigen E-Gitarre
Die mit dem Lachen, dreckig schön wie Schlammschlachten
Und den großen Funkplatten in den kleinen Handtaschen
Für all die Füchsinnen und Dende-Frauen
Aus „Diese Party ist noch lange nicht zu Ende!“-Town
Erster Mai - Molotov Cocktail klein
Westberlin, feminin, ock auf Streit
Schwarzer Gürtel, roter Lippenstift
Und im Lächeln im Gesicht hängt 'n dicker Spliff
Irgendwo ist sie und du findest sie bestimmt
Und die hat's dann in sich, und zwar doppelt mit'm Kind

Für all die ganzen besseren Hälften
Lieblingsmenschen, Hexen und Elfen
Babys und Schatzis, Musen und Nymphen
Für Ladies, die Nazis als „Husos“ beschimpfen
Die ihre Frau stehen, no matter der Aussehen
Mit Battlerap gegen „Hätte, hätt'“-Ausreden
Ja, das ist für alle Doppel-,X‘en
Die dicken Obelixen und die schicken Model-Chicksen
Alle, die blind vor Liebe sind und deshalb mit dem Herzen sehen
Die lächeln, auch wenn's besser ist, sie ernst zu nehmen
Das ist für Prinzessinnen, die Erbsen zählen
Und alle meine Schwestern, die grad deswegen die derbsten sind

Beginner,"Ich muss mir mal eben
Was von der Seele reden
Hab da so Probleme mit dem digitalisierten Leben
Schreib mein Dynamit immer noch auf DIN A4
Mach auf Curse für die Dramatik und rappe auf Klavier und sag
Der Baron von Münchhausen fickte Robocop
Raus kam eine Welt aus Autotune und Photoshop
Da sind wir nun, alles falsch, kalt und lieblos  
I-Phone sechs plus, Mensch sechs minus
Wo man Gefühle nur als Emoticons wahrnimmt
Hundert virtuelle Freunde, keinen der einen in Arm nimmt
Wir pumpen mit Fotos unsre großen Egos auf
Doch sind innerlich so leer wie 'n Schokonikolaus
Tinder statt Kinder, die Geigen sind verstummt
Das Alleinsein macht uns krank doch wir googlen uns gesund
Und dass die Welt im Dreck versinkt interessiert uns einen Scheiß

Mich gibt's als Software
Ich sitz' im Arbeitsamt neben Plattenläden und Faxgeräten
Auf der Suche nach 'ner freien Stelle
Als Randnotiz der Geschichte, die vergessen hat sich upzudaten
Und während ich mit der virtuellen Welt Arm drücke
Schmeißt sich meine Zukunft von der Datenautobahnbrücke
Und pfeift die Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod-Melodie
In MP3-Qualität durch die Zahnlücke
Denn ich bin ein Neanderdigitaler
Ich bin ein Opfer der Generation Klicks
Immer auf der Suche nach Substanz und gutem Karma
Doch Google und Konsorten finden dazu nichts
Und ich steh' vor einem Datenmüllberg aus Eitelkeiten
Jeder hat 'ne Onlinepetition, keiner geht Steine schmeißen
Und heimlich überwacht von meiner Webcam
Fühl ich mich wie Pacman denn ich will nur noch wegrennen

Beginner,"Und ich sag, sorry Baby, dass ich anders bin
Noch viel anderer als all die ganzen anderen

Alle so angepasst, ich so angepisst
Ist gar nicht so einfach wenn mann anders ist
Alle so Klassenbester mit teur'm Taschenrechner
Ich so Plattentester mit vollem Aschenbecher
Warst du kein Doppelgänger, warst du Einzelgänger
Und ich hab immer gehofft, das sich die Scheiße ändert
Doch es war und ist wie es ist
Auffälliger Mensch, abfälliger Blick
Alles wie immer, alles so wie sonst
Keine Paradiesvögel am engen Horizont
Nur die Bundesadler sind noch unterwegs
Während sogar die Sonne in der Masse untergeht

Ich denke Einflüsse, ich denke klappt schon
Sie sagen abschotten, wir sagen abholen

Von Anfang an ahnten die anderen das ich anders bin
Anders als all die anderen die anders sind
Kann da nicht sicher hinter stehen, sogar nicht mal mit Armeen
Aber wenn ich paar Dinger dreh' weht ein anderer Wind
Als Baby schon viel es mir leicht mit der Wahl
Schwimm' nicht mit dem Strom, kein Zitteraal
Von klein auf auch daheim ein Fremder
Ich war immer schon schräg so wie ein Bein länger
Ein Mann kann sich unter Druck grade machen
Ein Schrank kann nicht in 'ne Schublade passen
Lauter alte rostige Denkweisen
Ich bleibe außerhalb der Box wie Geschenkschleifen
Sie reden Fließband, ich rede Unikat
Eizi, Denyo, Mega das Triumvirat
Andere Wege gehen, Wege für die anderen ebnend
Zu sagen ich bin anders ist der understatement

We transgress the context of commonplaceness
We deny normality, trample morality
We destroy angels with sound
We destroy angels with silence

Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
Into the cosmic dance of four scythes
The curtains of Absurd Theatre are raised
Synchronicity - Mother Chaos on the stage

Thrilling words are spreading down the spine
Vibrating ""be strong!""

Which is absorbed by shadows of madness

",Intro
Behemoth,"Delightful night
When the full moon lights cemetery's valley
Winds of frost strike my tomb
When I am in eternal sleep
When wild storms dwell
Wind blows through the Baltic
Instincts unleash the war inside
And strike the sky with Holocaust thunder
Mountains sleep, the forest
Covers freezing land where I was born
Now I walk among the castles
Watch the streams of frozen tears
Spilled with blood of forefathers
Night breeze feed my spiritual form
And spirits gather, floating in the mist
My eastern empires spread wings of winter
Visions of destruction's ruin and tragedies
Tasting pure sin, fade into the pit
And walk through my beloved, endless woods
I summon all the beauty Evil
To rape the bodies of your disciples
Too long I hide in shades of woods
And now I build my beauty Hall
Wallachian tyrant, I bring a winter
I come with frost and burning hate!
Follow the gods of eastern lands
Being the battle which blows the earth",Wolves Guard My Coffin
Behemoth,"From beyond all paths of man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men

Of chaos I am, the disobedient one
Depraved son who hath dwelt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life of sin, to give birth to the ""I""

I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths of mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king of nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn

Hear
Feel
Pray
Kneel

No holiness rules over my freedom
No commands from above I obey
I seek the ruin, I shake the worlds
Behold! I am blackest of the black
Of chaos I am, the disobedient one
Depraved son who hath dwelt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life of sin, to give birth to the ""I""",Blackest Ov the Black
Behemoth,"Rise thy horns
For I'm at one with the dark
Divine presence ascends
Touching the forehead ov god

Hark! I was not, I have become
In rapture, in vengeance, in blood
From word into flesh
From man into god

""Strive ever to more""
So spake the wisdom ov snake
""Hold up thyself""
Sayeth the law ov the brave

Beyond all I am
Let it be known
Within my blood fire stirs
Thee I invoke, The Unspoken One

As the wolf among sheep yet cower I do not
Victorious, glorious, constantly thirsting
And as the anger fuels my heart and will
No longer fear that which feeble men fear

The centre and secret ov the Sun

Behemoth,"The centuries of woe have passed away

Our wrath shalt now shower o'er the earth
Praise to thee, whose tongue doth speak fire

This is the law of scourge, the EYE ov true revenge
Placing trust upon our blade against ignorance

Slain now resurrected, shackled now released
Hear is crippled souls, behold is ye blind fools
Awake in fear and feel the touch ov bitter bliss
Its no time for repenting, its time to kiss our swords
We are the new beginning, we light our torch ov war

We are the kaos warriors
Modern iconoclast
Cleansers, lurking, waiting
To conquer the universe
We are all and without equal

split my skin, fuck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels ov light

pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped is disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered

I nevermourn, I never look back
As long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace...

pain is timeless
When I question the laws ov god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...

At sunrise thou shouldst come.
Desired for so fucking long.
Ascend at my command,
Surmount the sea,
Throw open portals of life;
And scale this endless mountain.
Of grace and of tears,
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard,
Abandoned heart so desolate!

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond.

When heavenly chants mute;
Thy apparition I behold. 
Oh Venus, the sweetest of them all,
Let me bathe in thy divinity.
Descend! And Thou hast descended,
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth of blissful rays,
And fateless eyes encourage me.

Disobedience has such a victorious taste!

When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!

Wie schön wäre ne Pause jetzt

Und jeder einfach mal die Schnauze hält

Was soll all der Schmerz und all der Hass
Die unser Leben beeinträchtigen?

Wie kann das gehen?
Der Tag heut wäre richtig schön
Macht der Wunsch mich schon zum Verdächtigen?

Und während ich so singe, merk ich: He, das ist geklaut

Ich hör sofort zu singen auf, das ist die einzige Chance
Ich verzweifle an mir selbst und werde sentimental
Ich starre vor mich hin und seh mit einem Mal:

Meine Traumfrau - sie steht hier vor mir
Hallo Traumfrau - du gehörst zu mir
Traumfrau - du bist so wunderschön
Hallo Traumfrau - wie konnt ich dich nur übersehn?

Da vergess ich doch den ganzen Urheberrechtsscheiß
Jetzt mach ich einzig und allein das Engelsgesicht heiß
Ich wage nicht mehr wegzuschaun aus Angst, du bist fort
Ich wünsch mich einfach nur mit dir weit weg von diesem Ort
Und dann passierts: Dein Blick trifft meinen und die Funken sprühn

Unendlich weit und doch so nah

Das was du suchst, ist heut nicht hier

Bevor ihr jetzt mit Eiern werft
Hört euch doch erst mal an was mich so nervt

All die tolle ""Du bist Deutschland""-Euphorie
Wir können es schaffen und bald wissen wir auch wie
Ein neuer Anfang der wird schwer
Doch Nase hoch denn schließlich sind wir wieder wer

Wir sind super, wir sind einfach toll

Wir sind pünktlich, wir sind fleißig, wir sind fromm (from Germany)
Wir sind sicher dass wir in den Himmel kommen (best Quality)
Wir sind eindeutig die Geilen

Bela B.,"Der Wecker geht, ich habe keine Lust
Jetzt aufzustehen, doch ich weiß ich muss
Zur Arbeit geh‘n, die Miete zahlt sich nicht allein
Und unsere Kinder wollen auch gefüttert sein

Voller Grauen denk ich an den Berufsverkehr
Ach, wenn das Leben doch nur wie im Western wär
Kaffee und Whiskey, manchmal Bohnen mit Speck,
Mein Körper riecht nach grundehrlichem Dreck

Mein Colt geladen schussbereit,
Ist wirklich der tödlichste Revolver weit und breit
Doch auch den kann irgendwer besiegen,
Dann wird ein Mann noch steh‘n und einer bleibt liegen

Die tollsten Frauen sind die, die auf Kuhmist stehen,
Doch für mein Pferd, da lass ich jede Schönheit gehen
Vom Pokern pleite, von den Huren ausgenommen,
Wo kann ich einen letzten Whiskey herbekommen?

Mein Colt, mehr blieb mir nicht auf der Welt
Hey Freud, ich kenn dich, für dich gibt es Lösegeld
Willst hier raus, musst Du mich erst besiegen
Ein Mann wird noch steh‘n und einer bleibt liegen

Du weckst mich, reißt mich aus meinem Traum
Ich wünsch mir einen Galgen und dazu noch einen Baum
Ach, mach schon mal das Frühstück, Schatz, Du weißt ja was die Kinder kriegen
Und ich steh auf, ich steh verdammt noch mal auf und sie bleibt liegen
Immer bleibt sie liegen

Béla Fleck & the Flecktones,"One day I'd like to be rich and famous
Maybe be funny like Andy and Ames
Be on TV and sing like Stevie
And have a girl who'd never leave me

But I'd really like a place
Where there could be no war
A bright and shiny world where there ain't no poor
Where there's opportunity, peace and unity
Where people can be what they want to be

And where Apartheid could never happen again
Where people don't judge you by the color of your skin
Where I hold your hand and you hold mine
Where a helpful hand is never hard to find
A place where people care
Where no one could bear
When someone's hungry, with nothin' there
Where the heart is never cold
The young are never needy,
The old are never poor,
And the rich are never greedy

So bring the power to the people
The people to the power
Cuz now is the time, this is the hour
To stop thinkin' about war start thinkin' about peace
So on this life, we can get another lease
With a lesson to learn
A new direction to turn
So we can take it to the sky where we belong
Cuz 'fore to long, we been to wrong
We've got the right notes
But we play the wrong song
Stop thinkin' with your wallet
Think with your mind
So we can move ahead
Instead of behind
We got the people selling drugs
People are dying
Politicians talking and we know they're lyin'
Taxes for the poor, none for the rich
People starvin' here in American
Now ain't that a bummer

And now my heats been turned off
From my job, I've been laid off
What am I gonna do?
Well, is the shape I'm in
Because of my dark skin?
Now I know that can't be true
But since we're all down here
Let's work to make it better
Do our best for what it's worth
But you know the rules are bent
When you have to pay rent
Just to live on earth
Talk about justice

We're gonna do something now
That's gonna be really slick
We're gonna listen to Mr. Fleck and Chick

I'm gonna say one more thing
Then I'll get outta your face
How 'bout a sound
With a little bass

And we got missles on the ground
Lasers in space
Underground shelters, just in case
That something goes boom
Certain doom
Cuz in our hearts we didn't make enough room
For the love
It comes from up above
Let's stop talking war
And let's offer the dove

Cuz when it's done it's over
When it's over, it's done
We look back at the wars
And see nobobdy won
It's time to make a better place
For out daughters and our sons
Or life will be a blast

In a little while you can almost feel your fear

Every now and then there's a moment so close
I can see the future, telescope in front of me
Isn't it the way for a moment so near
To be further from the past and how we want to be

Way up high
The little folks zooming by
Ask them why
Or if they know the way we're goin'

Underneath the skin, in a moment so close
A little particles running 'round inside of me
Smaller than it goes, is a moment so near
More than I comprehendin' is a part of me

Started withe the light shinin' down from the sun
In a moment it would travel accross the universe
Couldn't you believe in a moment so real
More than words could say
And more than eyes could see you there

The ancient ways we turn
Descendents from the sky
De-act them where the spilled
To late to wonder why

Way up high
We're looking for a northern light
Hopin' that the evenin' star
Could point the way to where we're goin'

So close
So near
Where is
The faith

A moment close at hand
Whose hand will shake the ground
The answers all to clear
The questions to be found

Way up high
The little folks zooming by
Don't ask why
As if they know the way we're goin'

The dark, to fly
To take, the sky
To clear, so high
To late, don't try
So close, so near
It is, the fear

Funny how it goes with a moment so near
In a little while you can almost feel your fear
Meet me before time in a moment so close
Find another way to open your heart to me",A Moment So Close

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.

Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings

Por ti, sin ti, por ti, aha, sin ti

Hoy pensé que podría ser actriz
Y en los cines ver mi espectacular
Y ser algo genial seria sirena
Y a los peces hablaría en francés
Reina de una isla echa de ajedrez

Y en la escena final
Todo seria muy feliz
Tu podrías volar yo no tendría que llorar
Por ti, sin ti, por ti, aha, sin ti

Miedo, te dije bien que no quería estar aquí
No tengo tiempo, yo solo quiero regresar
Piensa, que me  molesta que no quieras escuchar
Que no lo entiendes yo solo quiero regresar

Pero al caminar encontré tu boca
Me invito a bailar, esa boca rosa
Y al anochecer, mis labios bailaron
Dentro de un cocktail la luna y tus labios

Oh, oh, oh

La madre de tus hijos
Y juntos caminar hacia el altar
Directo hacia la muerte

Y al final, ni hablar
Los dos nos destruimos
Y al final que tal
Tú y yo ya no existimos

No, no quiero ser esa mujer
Ella se fue a un abismo
Y tú no eres aquél que prometió

Sería mi súper héroe y que
Todo acabó, no queda más
Seremos dos extraños
Yo te olvidaré, me olvidarás
Hasta nunca.

Y dónde quedó ese botón
Que lleva a la felicidad
Luna de miel, rosa pastel
Clichés y tonterías

Y al final, ni hablar
Los dos nos destruimos
Y al final qué tal
Tu y yo ya no existimos

No, no quiero ser esa mujer
Ella se fue a un abismo

Yo ya no me acordaría de ti
Pensar que un día fui la respuesta
De la pregunta que hoy quiero olvidar

¿Donde esta el corazón de quién tu amas?
Tal vez en un rincón del mar de tus besos
Del mar que quiero secar
Del mar

Tal vez si yo fuera un poco más sensata
Habría inventado una poción
Para borrar el sabor de tu boca
Y la pregunta que hoy quiero olvidar

¿Donde esta el corazón de quién tu amas?
Tal vez en un rincón del mar de tus besos
Del mar que quiero secar
Del mar que un día fue para mi
Y, ¿hoy de quién?

Sólo yo giraré
Es la música que me acelera
Sólo yo volaré

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying

Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

Enough, I walk but never
Reach the other side
Here this building's never tall
Enough for me to touch the sky
I've heard about a place where
Everyone knows how to fly
Shangri-La

Here statues on a palace
Lawn are all the friends I had
That turned to stone
Tears rolling down their ivory
Cheeks they didn't make it home

Hearts beat at one time

Believe, it's lipstick and a comb
And it's Judas on a throne
Weird how silver lies and golden
rules they teach their
Kids in school to never say
Forever so they severed all
Their ties with Shangri-La

They say it never rains in
Shangri-La a multi-colored
Rainbow fades into a neon sky
Taste candied coated halos
While pakadotted ponies teach
The children how to fly

Here our seasons have all
Learned to share the summer
Sun can warm the winter air
Here leaves only fall to kiss
The ground and it makes
The sweetest sound
We'll start another language
Using all the words that
Rhyme with Shangri-La

The silver snow in Shangri-La
Turns to silver sand so it will
Never melt away come along
With me to Shangri-La we'll
Build a silver snowman on the
Warmest summers day
No one ever cries in Shangri-La
We take a kiss and mix it
With a glass of ocean wine
And if you close your eyes in
Shangri-La a million falling stars
Will gently whisper you to sleep
And when whisper you to sleep
And when you wake you'll find
It's not a dream",Shangri-La

A time of birth, a time of death, perishing mortals

Houses of clay, doomed to decay, foundations of earth
Men come from dust, and to the dust, in death all return

The Lord did mold, man's flesh and soul, a creation of soil
But just as man, from dust began, in death will face judgment
But Christ was slain, bearing our pain, taking our sentence
The Christ was dead, the blood He shed, absolves the guilty

Prophecy fulfilled, His perfect will, providing eternal life

Yo lo fui una vez
Al estar junto a ti
Era la ley

Ahora ya no estas
Y fue un dolor
Perder tu amor
Y no ver tu valor

La brisa del mar
Me hacía amarte más
Sentir, soñar
Aprender a vivir

La brisa se fue
Y yo te perdí
Por que, no sé
No te olvides

Al final, será
Como ayer
Más que un recuerdo
Al final, será
Lo que no fue
Y nunca pudo ser
Hey hey
Tu nombre está en mi piel

Eres mi obsesión
Una dulce pasión
Que al final se llevó
Mi corazón

Las lunas de abril
Me hacen recordar
Tu amor
Tan lentamente

Y amarte nunca fue un error
Ni fue una falsa tentación
Tampoco lo decidí yo
Me distes un amor intenso que perdí

Recordar cada instante
Y será como antes
Recordar cada instante
Y será como antes",¿Quién Es Feliz?

Que me dejo con el alma rota
Algo en ti cambio
Que no lo ves
Solo escuchame esta vez
Porque por ti puedo existir
Porque por ti puedo morir
Ahora...

Me tiembla el corazón
Solo de ver
Que ya no me abrazas mas
Que de tu vida me aleje
Sin apenas comprender
Porque tu amor es cruel quiza
No eres feliz estando junto a mi
CORO
Why vine a decirte adiós
No puedo engañarte más
Tus besos no saben igual
En tu vida hay alguien más
Nunca te podré olvidar
Porque por ti aprendi a amar
Aunque a ti te de igual
Se muy bien que hay alguién más
VERSO
Me he vuelto el fantasma de tu voz
La que no recibe amor
Why aun asi no me importo
Reincarnaste en mi otro yo
Why es irrepetible why es irreversible
Como termino...

Porque sin ti no hay camino ni destino
Estoy perdida
Porque sin ti no me importan
Los minutos ni los días

Porque sin ti no hay presente ni futuro
Sálvame
De esta bella traición que mató mi razón

Perdona si me olvido de ti
Lo siento si agoté la ilusión
No me importa el juramento que te dí

Me dicen que tu amor terminó
Que sólo eres una canción de ayer
Un suspiro que en el aire se quedó

Dónde estarás
Cuando mis labios te busquen
y dónde estará

El sueño tan dulce que
Era de los dos
Fuiste mi bella traición

Porque sin ti no me importan

Belinda,"No creo en recetas de felicidad
Lejos de ti gané libertad
Why recuperé mi fé otra vez
Porque mi corazón hoy pasa de ti

Mis huesos van sólo detrás de mí
Why hoy me dá igual
Si me quieres tendrás que esperar
No soy tan facil de recuperar

Yo no juego
Mi alma es de hielo
Si me tocas te congelo

Puedo ser feliz contigo o sin ti
Ya no necesito nada
Mi vida es sincera why de pocas palabras
Ya no necesito nada

Camino sola por la ciudad
Sin importar subir o bajar
No tengo miedo de lo que dirán
El aire sabe a flores

why el humo a desamores
Why entre miradas me pierdo why te vuelvo a ver
Si tu piensas que voy a volver
No te lo creas, no va a suceder

Yo no juego
Mi alma es de hielo
Si me tocas te congelo

Puedo ser feliz contigo o sin ti

Mientras los segundos van pasando
No sé como te podré olvidar
Cae la lluvia en la ventana
Dibujando tu mirada
Un instante es una eternidad

Estoy cansada de soñar sin ti
Confundir la realidad
Y no sé si volverás
Para amarme y esperar
Sin pedirme nada más
Si pudiera ser verdad
Ya no habría oscuridad

En cada historia hay un final
En cada amor hay desamor
En cada encuentro hay una ilusión
Somos tanta gente sola y diferente
Amanecer contigo hasta morir

Y no sé si volverás
Para amarme y esperar
Sin pedirme nada más
Si pudiera ser verdad
Ya no habría oscuridad

Y no sé si volverás
Para amarme y esperar
Sin pedirme nada más
Si pudiera ser verdad
Ya no habría oscuridad
Solo luz sin gravedad
Si pudiera ser verdad
Ya no habría oscuridad
Ya no habría oscuridad

Dejar que la ilusión nos atrape a los dos

Todos juntos sin miedo a amanecer
Dejando todo sin nada que perder

No lo pude evitar

Todo en silencio
Why no entiendo ,cómo, alguien, puede
Amar sufriendo
Yeaa, amar sufriendo
Sólo por ti

Mi voz no te alcanza
Siento que te perdí
Se escucha el eco
De un silencio que habla de tí

why puedo escribir
La más triste canción
Para decirte amor
Que no te puedo olvidar

I can find a piece of mine, 
I don't know where you are, maybe
Near or maybe far, I just need a little light

If I could find the love like in your eyes
See a million people, everyone's so lonely
But we don't have to be alone tonight

Con la noche en la cintura, tu recuerdo a flor de piel 
Voy perdiendo la cordura con la luna hasta los pies, 
Voy tratando de acordarme, pero todo esta al revés 
La vida es un instante, que no nunca vuelve otra vez 
Why entonces te das cuenta, de lo que puedes perder 
La suerte da la vuelta, como un amante infiel 
Mañana no será, lo que pudo ser ayer 
Ya no hay sueños de verdad, si no se tiene fe 
Why quien hay? 
Why quien hay?

Solo un rumor, solo una voz, que me viene a hablar de amor 
No hay nadie más, en mi rincón 
Solo Dios sabe quien soy 
Solo un rumor, solo una voz, que me viene a hablar de amor 
No hay nadie más, en mi rincón 
Solo Dios sabe quien soy 

verso 2

Tu silencio es un reflejo de los sueños del ali 
Why tu nombre es un recuerdo que se olvido de mí 
Mi alma esta en la mente quien me la podrá comprar 
Para que hoy no me mientas, ya no quiero verte más

Es tanto mi deseo y no puedo controlarlo no no no

Quiero mas... mas mas mas 
dame mas mas mas mas, quiero mas.

Mas oh mas oh mas oh mas oh mas oh

¿Como no enamorarme?
A todo podría arriesgarme
Solo tu me haces perder la razón oh oh oh
Ven el que no arriesga no gana
Por eso sigo aquí, por la música,

Y siempre 
Quiero mas mas mas mas 
dame mas mas mas mas, quiero mas.
Mas oh mas oh mas oh mas oh mas oh",Dame Mas
Belinda,"Sé que fallé y te perdí, ¿cómo olvidar?
Y ahora grito tan fuerte cómo deseo tenerte otra vez

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Espero que no sea tarde
Y puedas volver a amarme
Verás en mí un cambio radical
Me siento con frío y pánico
Descalza en el suelo ártico
Ten compasión, no me castigues más

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Quiero saber de mi pecado
Eso que no me has contado
Y tal vez no sea verdad
El amor es arte y ensayo
Y hoy de tus errores yo callo
Cuando se ama hay que perdonar

Entre la sombra que ilumina el sol
Veo el reflejo de nuestro esplendor

Sé que no es el final
Por ti siempre voy a esperar
Sé que algún día tú volverás

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor
volverás
tú volverás
tú volverás",En El Amor Hay Que Perdonar [Balada] [Version]
Belinda,"Dame un poco mas

De lo que tu me das

Solo quiero verte una vez mas
No sé si mañana el sol saldrá
Quiero acariciarte
Ven a desnudarme
Regálame otra piel

Y sé, que si no es hoy
La vida se nos pasara
Ya lo veras
Solo hay una oportunidad
Que no volverá

Amor en otra vida
Si no estás
No puedo soltarte
A ti quiero atarme
Me niego a olvidarte

Y sé, que si no es hoy
No hay futuro que esperar
Porque sin ti
No existe la felicidad
Muero de ansiedad
Maldita levedad
Mil valiums que tomar

Coser mis labios a tu boca
Por una eternidad
Que si no estás me vuelvo loca

And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

That night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

Just someone with soul
It was on the day I met you
I vowed to never let you go

I never knew much about romance
Always used my lucky charms
I learned it all in just one lesson
When you first held me in your arms

Open up your heart
Let me inside
If you listen to your intuition
We'll have a chance tonight

Keep me in your heart
And hold on tight
If you read into my intuition
We'll find a way tonight

I put away all my heroes
And all the lovers I have known
Even though I've had my share
I've spent too many nights alone

I have found my paradise

And a fortune in your eyes

Why do you sit in silence
When there's a whole world waiting
Between these islands

I lay my love down to make you this bridge
But when the tide runs out
I'm still at the water's edge

There's a deep deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that
Deep deep ocean
What's it take for you to be satisfied

You walk alone at night
So secretive and quiet
I hear the roar of your heartbeat
So why do you deny it

Hold me and show me my love can't be wrong
And I'll be swept away
By the storm beneath your calm

There's a deep deep ocean
I want to find out what you hide inside of that

What's it take for you to be satisfied

A view from my window
Touched by innocence

Now fading away
Into a quiet storm
Of the tears of the angels

Falling around me
As I'm watching the days 
I frame colors of passion

Against a fading sky 
With a stroke of love
On the canvas of my soul

I'm painting a perfect world
With shades of Michael Angelo
With each promise made

In every heart that knows
We can live in a perfect world

Grows in my garden
I feel the earth
Beneath my feet

Are dreams of a future
Where all of this world

Belinda Carlisle,"I remember when I met you
All the stars were hanging in mid-air
In these moments nothing mattered
But the way you caught me in your stare
We were walking we were talking
We were laughing about the state of our lives
How our fates brought us together
As the moon was rising in your eyes

On and on the night was falling
Deep down inside us
On and on a light was shining right through

Ah La Luna La Luna
The night that we fell under the spell of the moon
Ah La Luna La Luna
The light that will being me back to you
The light of La Luna

In the hotels, in the cafes
All the world was made with romance
In the harbor moonlit water
All the ships were swaying in a dance
Then you held me and you kissed me
And I knew I had to be with you
You didn't ask me you just took me
To the tiny bed in your tiny room

On and on the band was playing
A song of surrender
On and on the sun would soon break through

Now I walk along the streets of Marseilles
The winter sky is cold and gray
And I don't know why I left you that day
And I don't know where you are",La Luna

And his kisses hotter than the

And we poured our hearts out
As the train pulled out
I can see my baby
Waving from the train

Every time I hear the thunder

Take away the borders inside your head
And you'll see other things instead
Realize the life we've led is all over now

[Chorus]

I said love, love revolution
I said love, love revolution

If we're gonna turn the world around
It's time that we get down to it
If we're gonna turn the world around
It's time that we get down to it
Now I know that there's another way
And I'm not waiting one more day
To make love revolution
For you, baby
For me, baby
And I want to be around
When your walls come tumbling down
In a love revolution
A love revolution
Love revolution",Love Revolution
Belinda Carlisle,"Under me
The endless sky
I have my peace of mind
I can see
For miles and miles
I hear my heartbeat echo
I feel the colors flowing over me
World of love
It only happens in a world of love
Can you feel it, so divine, I'll make my own
World of love
Everything changes in a world of love
So surreal I believe the way I feel
Do you believe
In destiny
Ooh it will set you free
Everything starts with a kiss
No thought of tomorrow
Right now is just a place for you and me

It only happens in a world of love
Can you feel it, so divine

Belinda Carlisle,"I thought I heard a sound
Somebody calling out to me
So I turned around

Strangers as far as I could see
Drifting through this crowd
Barely awake form last night's dream

I call your name out loud
I never thought you'd answer
You came out of nowhere, baby

Just when I felt like giving up
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality

This side of eternity
Why'd you take so long?
Man, I thought you'd never get here

I waited for the dawn
Never finding you was my one fear
It's dark before it's light

And just when you can't believe your eyes
Morning breaks bright, and the storm is over
You came out of nowhere, baby

Just when I felt like giving up
Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality

This side of eternity
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I thought it was all too much

Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity

It might have rained for the rest of my life
But you came along
It could have been pain for all of these nights

But you came to stay
You came out of nowhere, baby
Just when I felt like giving up

Do you know where I've been searching?
Everywhere this side of reality
This side of eternity",You Came Out of Nowhere
Belinda Carlisle,"I guess I didn't hear you right
Did you say that you were leaving me?
You really must be feeling bad
To say those kinds of things to me
I'm sorry that you feel that way
Because I

Thought that we really had it made
That you and I were gonna last
I guess it's fair to let you know
You're nothing without me
I wouldn't walk out that door
Or you may find out the hard way
Just what love is for
You're nothing without me
You'll never fall in love again
Because there's only one me and you
Why pretend?

So you want to be someone new
You want to go and have a ball
The party's been missing you
Baby, can't you hear them call?
Well, I won't stand in your way
I just want to

Give you a little free advice
I'd like to help you help yourself
Save you some trouble on the way
You're nothing without me
I wouldn't walk out that door
Or you may find out the hard way
Just what love is for

You're nothing without me
But the person that you used to be
Do you remember what a drag it was
Being so lonely?
You're nothing without me
I wouldn't walk out that door
Or you may find out the hard way
Just what love is for

You're nothing without me
But a ship without a sail
Alone in the middle of a dead, calm sea
Standing still
You're nothing without me
But a person in a sad cafe
May I suggest dinner for one
Before you go on your way?",You're Nothing Without Me
Belinda Carlisle,"I don't know how you do what you do to me
I'm so shaken by you baby
I can barely breath
Every time I see you
I just want to break down and cry
No one's ever moved me
Just the way you move me inside

Do you feel like I feel
Or am I all alone
Is this love really real

Baby I've got to know

When you held me last night
Were your words really real
Are you just using me
Or do you feel like I feel
Do you feel like I feel

From that moment that I met you baby
I just knew
It was so easy for me just to be with you
When the sun comes shining
Will you still be lying by my side
Tell me if I'm dreaming
Is there deeper meaning
For me in your life

Do you feel like I feel
Or am I all alone
Is this love really real

Baby I've got to know

When you held me last night
Were your words really real
Are you just using me
Or do you feel like I feel
Do you feel like I feel

I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one who needs you
I'm the one who won't let go
You've got all the power
I'm dying by the hour

When you held me last night were your words really real
God I'm so much in love
Do you feel like I feel, like I feel, like I feel",Do You Feel Like I Feel?
Belinda Carlisle,"Only one shadow on the wall
Just one candle burning bright
I hold your picture to my heart
I'm alone inside the night
The sun comes up in China the lights go on in Rome

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
Every time you leave me a part of me goes too
And half your world is waiting here for you

I reach across an empty bed
I hear your whisper in my ear
But like the sun without the moon
It's half a dream without you here
The train that takes you from me
Brings somebody home

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
Every time you leave me a part of me goes too
And half your world is waiting here for you

Baby the earth stands still
When I'm lying next to you
No matter where you go
Our whole world's inside this room
The sun comes up in China
The lights go on in Rome oh

Half the world is waiting for someone they can hold
Half the world is praying they'll never be alone
And every time you leave me my heart breaks in two
And half the world is waiting here for you

I'm waiting here for you",Half the World
Belinda Carlisle,"Take my hand
Tell me what you are feeling
Understand
This is just the beginning 

Although I have to go
It makes me feel like crying
I don't know when I'll see you again 

Darling leave a light on for me
I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling leave a light on for me
'Cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe 

I can't explain I just don't know
Just how far I have to go
But darling I'll keep the key
Just leave a light on for me 

Yes I know
What I'm asking is crazy
You could go
Just get tired of waiting
But if I lose your love
Torn out by my desire
That would be the one regret of my life 

Just like a spark lights up the dark
Baby that's your heart",Leave a Light On

I see you all around
But you don't seem very happy now
You seem very down

And you should be having a good time

And if you want me I'll be there
To run my fingers through your hair
If you need me it's alright

I must tell you that I really
Love you dearly
But you are so obsessed with yourself
There's no room for me
You can't give me all the things I need

We've said all we can say
Except our last goodnight
To end this day
Don't try changing my mind
You won't find a way
Just say hello
To our goodbye day.

What you see without detection
I see clearly
All your perfect imperfections

To go away

The one who told you no
I don't care if you don't like it
But I had to let you know
That love is at the door
And it's pounding to be let in
There's angels on the ceiling
My heart is on the floor
And I can't just be your friend

Here comes my baby, walking back to me
Here comes my baby, for all the world to see
Why don't you stay 'til tomorrow
I don't wanna let you go
Here comes my baby

How long did I
Refuse to see the light
How could I deny
It must have been my pride
You say you're on your way
Before you go I'll be there
I've felt a resurrection
All my senses have returned
Oh, this I swear
It won't be long
(I tell, I tell myself)
Just be strong
(I tell, I tell myself)
Here comes my baby, walking back to me
Here comes my baby, for all the world to see
Why don't you stay 'til tomorrow
I don't wanna let you go
Here comes my baby

Belinda Carlisle,"Your words how they cut so deep
I can hear you in my sleep
Lying here, wishing here
Wishing here, waiting

You forget I know your tender spots
But I'll be careful with your heart
But I'm the one loving you
So come on and love me

Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Why'd you want to go
And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down down
Lay with me

Sometimes I can be so cold
I let you in but I don't let go
Pulling you, pushing you
Pushing you, pulling

Don't want to tear our love apart
Can we find each other in the dark?
Can we start living here?
Can we start giving?

So, we are in love
So, we are at war
But we can be on the same side
",Lay Down Your Arms
Belinda Carlisle,"Dreams in the night
Dreams overflow
Building bridges to each other
Hearts make the waters flow

Sunlight and diamonds
Reflecting hope
Making journeys to each other
Going where lovers go

You were sleeping, I was walking
To the rhythm of hate falling rain
Too much water, to cross over
All the bridges falling down

You sing me songs
With overtures
From strange exotic places
Words I've never known

Wait 'til the morning
Don't send me back
Don't send me back across the rainbow
No return to where I've been

You were reaching, I was taken
To the river in the light of dawn
Too much water, to cross over
All the bridges falling down

Falling down
Come lie beside me
Lie beside me now
Beneath the waves
Beauty surrounds us",Too Much Water
Belinda Carlisle,"You try to be a mystery
With all your eccentricities
Every move is so surreal
You can't touch what you really feel

I see a deeper side
More than you know
Don't even try to hide
I've been everywhere you go

All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
Break away the chains
Set you free
With everything that I can give to you
Wrap my arms around your world

You try to push the truth away
With all your witty repartee
A psychedelic romeo
Who thinks and does it all for show

I see myself in you
I know we're both afraid
There is an emptiness
Behind our masquerade

All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world

Wash away my sins
And all the ways we hurt each other
Oh how we hurt ourselves

Come out of isolation
I wanna show myself
Of God, I wanna cry out loud

I wanna be one with you
Get down to the real emotion
I wanna let love break through
We can kiss the truth
One with you
I wanna hold you deep inside my heart
Feel what love can do
To know that I am one with you

Come lie down in my garden
Leave your mark on me
I know I can't be scared forever
Come on and humble me, humble me

I'm so tired of living in my head
The precious comfort of my own bed
I've glorified my spiritual side
Now take me down to the ground where I can't hide
I know I can love myself
I wanna give to someone else
I wanna know you

There doesn't seem to be much more
My mind is shut, the door is closed
Am I alone?

We're sitting here, we're eye to eye
We've crashed into a wall so high
Fear's taken us two prisoners
Can we let go?

Tell me your darkest secret, tell me
Show me what you don't want me to see
Let me in, I want to know you, hold me
Tell me your darkest secret

I'll tell you mine

We used to live for honesty
Trust was our security
We're walking down two different paths
We've lost our way

What's wrong with wanting everything
Dark and light and in between
What will be our saving grace?
What can we say?

Unlock the door, come inside
There's no reason to be afraid
Just talk to me

We can hear the cry of love
It echoes deep and far above
What will be our saving grace?
What will we say?
",Tell Me
Belinda Carlisle,"I open the door
You stand there in the rain
Your eyes say it all
I know 'cause I feel the same

Why do we do the things we do?
How can both of us be so cruel?
Why are we so afraid?

Take my hand, and step into the light
As we touch, our hearts will open wide
Kiss my lips, and hold me now
And lie here by my side
Help me find a place where love hides
We will find the place where love hides

I follow you home
You smile there in the dark
I hear your words
How they twist me and tear me apart

Why do we hurt the ones we trust?
Is that all that's become of us?
Why are we so afraid?

Take my hand, and step into the light
As we touch, our hearts will open wide
Kiss my lips, and hold me now
And lie here by my side
Help me find the place where love hides
We will find the place where love hides",Where Love Hides

Defenses fade, we've come undone
Desire, the answer for harmony

Deep into the night
We're looking through the windows of the world
Underneath the sky
We're opening the windows of the world

We stay afloat on this sea of storms
The tides of time carry us along
Beginning and ending with what we know

Belinda Carlisle,"The mornin' sun touched lightly
On the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In her white suburban bedroom
In her white suburban town
As she lay there, neath the covers
Dreamin' of a thousand lovers'
'Til the world turned orange
And the room went spinnin' round

At the age of thirty-seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her daddy's easy chair

Her husband he was off to work
And the kids were off to school
And there were on so many ways
For her to spend the day
She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street
Screamin' all the way

The evenin' sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car
That waited past the crowd",The Ballad of Lucy Jordan

To where the ocean meets the sky

And as you walked on by
I pulled my scarf across my face
And I began to cry
For all the love I'd thrown away

When you held me last night
Were your words really real
Are you just using me
Or do you feel like I feel
Do you feel like I feel

I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one who needs you
I'm the one who won't let go
You've got all the power
I'm dying by the hour
Come on baby let me know

When you held me last night were your words really real
God I'm so much in love
Do you feel like I feel, like I feel, like I feel",Do You Feel Like I Feel

We've got no time to waste
'Cause we want the same thing

We're fighting a war
But we don't know what for
'Cause we want the same thing

I know we're different now
Different as night and day
But still want you near
I just want you to stay
I want to take this chance
I want to be with you
'Cause what you're looking for
I am looking for too

We dream the same thing
We want the same thing, ooh
And all that we need is to
See it together
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing, ooh
For now, for love, forever, amen

I look in your eyes and
I know deep inside that
We want the same thing

Breaking the chains that
Just keep us in shame
'Cause we want the same thing

No matter what we say
No matter what we do
Beyond the battlelines

You know you've got me where I want to be 'cause lover

Belinda Carlisle,"Last night
The April breeze was whispering
A hearts confession
That could
Mean so much
Starts to touch my wild suspicion
So close, not far away
A bluer world another way

[Chorus:]
Lavender, tangerine
Hmm baby anything
Life is not what it seems.
Make a wish on a star
Oh you'll go far
Life is only a dream

I find a solitude
In my imagination
Past is past, bring it back
Memories are made too fast
I'm giving in no hesitation

So close to mystery
I close my eyes so I can see

[Chorus:]

And if you think there is an answer
I tell you what I find
A million miles behind the vista.

Belinda Carlisle,"Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every man deserves a chance 
To bring home a decent pay 
Every race is equal
Beloved in God's eyes 
When I see discrimination my soul cries 
Say a prayer for the lonely 
A prayer for the confused 
Say a prayer if you'd only 
For the secretly abused 
Say a prayer for the newborn 
With all the battles to be won 
Say a prayer for the tired and worn 
Say a prayer for everyone 

Walk a mile with a stranger 
Put yourself in his shoes 
Lend a hand to an old one 
Good will come to you 
In our heads were happy 
We go our merry way 
In our hearts were all afraid of our dying day 

Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every woman deserves a chance

Et les coupeurs d'osier moissonnent mes vingt ans

Qu'on chantait en rêvant au garçon de la fête

Mais je ne les sais pas, mais je ne les sais pas

Elle sort de moi-même en silence à pas lent
Ma jeunesse fout le camp elle a rompu l'amarre
Elle a dans ses cheveux les fleurs de mes vingt ans

Naked as a baby on his birthing hour
With his butt on the vinyl and all that horsepower

And old number 6, big money or bust

The day crazy bobby ran the dirt track in the nude

All the old men and all the old women said he ruined the trip
If they'd wanted burned rubber and rubber burning they'd have gone to the drag strip
An old boy said he's taking quite a chance
Going hard into the corner and wearing no pants

But he laughed all the way to the checkered flag and the money instead

With a super dope body that I had to get
So I stepped to her

?Whatever?s clever,? was what she said
Then the next thing you know she was in my bed
She was doin? me, baby, and I was doin? my duty
She was a helluva cutie
(Why)
Because she had a ghetto booty

Me, Rick and Ron was coolin? at the party
Pushed up on a sexy young hottie

Let's go chill so I can get to know you better
Her first name was Loretta, she drove up a Baretta

We got to my room, she said, ?What are you gonna do?
?Well, let me slip into something more comfortable like you?

And then I slapped her with a taste of the bowzack

Yeah, yo?, Sick what's up with the honey that named Melinda
She got a ghetto booty, I wanna hit it from the center

It?s a booty that's firm, luscious and juicy
Kinda tender like a Roni but sensitive enough to do me
The kinda booty that'll make your day
But you gotta, gotta rub it the right way

Crisp and clean wrapped in tight jeans
Makin? all the fellas up at the club scream
But yo?, it?s dope, so I?mma step to the cutie
And do what I gotta do to get that ghetto booty

Yo, yo who's dat?

Ladies all around
Me and the crew doin' what we do

Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine

Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak in you and lose control

My temperature's warm
So let me freak you through the floor
While the bass is bumpin'
All night if your body can handle

Chillin' at the house on the hill
You gotta say my my my like Johnny Gill
Hey, rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect

At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire

But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ah-yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Baby it's all good so dance tonight

Yeah, beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
(It's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing)
Let your body give into your soul

A reason to celebrate

Paradise for two
I lost my lover
There on the blue

We went sailing
On a coral sea
Starlit waters
My darling and me

Time was endless
Love sang its song
We dreamed of tomorrow
Now he is gone

I see his lips
In the coral
I see his eyes
In the water blue
I see his hair
In the glowing sunlight
A vision clear
Calling me near

In Bermudan waters
Oh, so clear and cold

As I grow old

Where toro and toreador reign
Of a boy not so old, who was feeling quite bold
With the fire of bullfighting in his veins

He's just a muchacho who came there to watch, oh
The thrill of the crowd in his heart
The colors are flashing, the matador's dashing
Of this life, he wishes he could be a part

He goes to his mama, I'll begin mañana,
A toreador - olé, I must be
My cape will be brighter - ay mamacita, I'll be zee best fighter
From here, toro, TORO, he does not look so big to me!

When out storms the bull, he's a torrent of fur
His bravery shows by the dust that he stirs
Around the arena he snorts his protest
'Til niño's heart's thumping within his small chest

And, so this muchacho who's just there to watch, oh
Thinks that he'd better go home to play
For now he feels small; this bull, he look so tall
He would rather come back and fight some other day

There is a song
I'm in the crow's nest with binoculars

It has me tied up at a rate of knots

Just me and this midnight oil

And the tears she knows
Shall not fade

To a place where dreams
Find their deaths amongst the stars

Time will never fade

Will I never see your face
In the light of years
Free from evening's sorrow
Let this pendant hold your gaze
Comfort lies within
Memories of our times gone

Careless words were spent
Careless arms once held you near
Have I always known
This would be our end?
Snow obscures the earth
Just as time obscures the past
Details fade away
Visions fill the sky with ash

Fall away

Her faded fears fall through the night
To find me where I lay
Through the years we wandered
Through the darkest days
Her faded sight
In her eyes I'll never follow
Fall into my arms again and say
Never go away
Never fade away
Her crystal tears, I never needed more
So fall into my arms again my friend

Falling fast into the dark November sky
Over voices she shall cry
Soundless screams are felt before the sun can rise

Hear her voice is strong as steel
Speaking long dead nams to keep the evening still
In her heart teast all time
Trapped for now in faith that death is still alive

To the fields and seas again
Without sign we wander through the haze of this dark land

In a dream she gently cries
In a tear her story moves to find the floor
And she speaks before she goes away
""Carry on my friend, but leave me not alone""

'Til the riegn of sleep again
Without sight we wander through the haze of this dark land
To the fields and seas again
Without sight she wanders trough the haze of this lost land

Until the end
To wake beneath the rain

I know nothing lasts so long
My patience waits
I feel no remorse

There once was warmth
Just one word, just one prayer is all I need
To save me from myself

Bellafea,"Do you remember that day last winter? 
You were wearing that sweater, the one I always talked about. 
I asked you to dinner and you never answered. 
I spent all summer wondering what I did wrong. 

Red wine and T-Rex and photographs of your friends, 
Snapshots of you smiling, standing next to Spanish cliffs. 
I had on my black dress, the one I never wear enough. 
Cold air and no blankets so you turned on the furnace. 

And if you showed up I'd surely jump, surprised at the sight of you. 
You who promised never to return to anything that you once knew. 
Has it really been so long? 

I'm still waiting for you to say...

that you remember that day last winter. 
You were wearing that sweater, the one I always talked about and 
I asked you to dinner and you never answered.

Belle & Sebastian,"She called me up today
Meet me down at the old cafe
I jumped into the shower
I was getting my marching orders

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

She'd never stand for any lies
She's got an Out Tray full of guys
I could sense a breath, a whole new feeling
Now she says she wants to call a meeting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

I'm a slave to work
I'm only living when I walk amongst the office staff
And catch up with the office wag
I'll be in bed by nine
My curtains drawn
My thoughts composed
I get to work on time

She gave me some dictation
But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I'm want to give you the job
I'm pushing for a raise
I've been pushing now for days

My output is in decline
I was burned out after Thatcher
My banner I laid down with a sigh
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her

I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A sharp suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly

Have you shaved for work yet baby
Don't go out the boss is waiting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime

Are you ok now?

On Saturday I was an angel shining fair
You shone louder, longer
You put my shine to shame
Put me to shame now
Put me to shame

What is it I must do to pay for all my crimes?
What is it I must do?
I would do it all the time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now

The woodland spring will put the darkness from your thinking
If this town's your sinking ship
Then you know where to jump

Talking dirty, for a hobby it's fine
So pour another glass of wine
I'll think of England this time

All I wanted was to sing the saddest songs
If somebody sings along I will be happy now",The Boy Done Wrong Again
Belle & Sebastian,"Fox in the snow, where do you go
To find something you could eat?
Cause the word out on the street is you are starving
Don't let yourself grow hungry now
Don't let yourself grow cold
Fox in the snow

Girl in the snow, where do you go
To find someone that will do?
To tell someone all the truth before it kills you
They listen to your crazy laugh
Before you hang a right
And disappear from sight
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book tonight

Boy on the bike, what are you like
As you cycle round the town?
You're going up, you're going down
You're going nowhere
It's not as if they're paying you
It's not as if it's fun
At least not anymore
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a break
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a holiday

Kid in the snow, way to go
It only happens once a year
It only happens once a lifetime
Make the most of it
Second just to being born
Second to dying too
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
What else would you do?

Belle & Sebastian,"Ooh! Get me away from here I'm dying
Play me a song to set me free
Nobody writes them like they used to
So it may as well be me
Here on my own now after hours
Here on my own now on a bus
Think of it this way
You could either be successful or be us
With our winning smiles, and us
With our catchy tunes, and us
Now we're photogenic
You know, we don't stand a chance
Oh, I'll settle down with some old story
About a boy who's just like me
Thought there was love in everything and everyone
You're so naive!
After a while they always get it
They always reach a sorry end
Still it was worth it as I turned the pages solemnly, and then
With a winning smile, the boy
With naivety succeeds
At the final moment, I cried
I always cry at endings

Oh, that wasn't what I meant to say at all
From where I'm sitting, rain
Washing against the lonely tenement
Has set my mind to wander
Into the windows of my lovers
They never know unless I write
""This is no declaration, I just thought I'd let you know goodbye""
Said the hero in the story
""It is mightier than swords
I could kill you sure
But I could only make you cry with these words""

Oh, get me away, I'm dying...","Get Me Away from Here, I'm Dying"
Belle & Sebastian,"Anthony walked to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again
If he goes back to the house then things would go from bad to worse, what could he do?
He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that funny day
And if there is something else beyond, he isn't scared because
It's bound to be less boring than today
It's bound to be less boring than tomorrow

Hilary walked to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say
Everybody thought that she was boring, so they never listened anyway
Nobody was really saying anything of interest, she fell asleep
She was into S&M and bible studies
Not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me
Her cup of tea, she would admit to no one
Her cup of tea, she would admit to me
Oh but her cup of tea, she would admit to no one

Hilary went to the Catholic Church because she wanted information
The vicar, or whatever, took her to one side and gave her confirmation
Saint Theresa's calling her, the church up on the hill is looking lovely
But it doesn't interest, the only things she wants to know is
How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow
How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever

When she got back, her spirituality was thrown into confusion
So she got a special deal on renting
From the man at Rediffusion
""Look at me! I'm on TV
It makes up for the shortcomings of being poor
Now I'm in a million pieces"", picked up for deliberation
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever
But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
Chances are you'll probably feel better
If you stayed and played with yourself",If You're Feeling Sinister

Judy, let's go for a walk
We can kiss and do whatever you want
But you will be disappointed

You dream of horses

The best looking girls are staying inside
So Judy, where does that leave you?

With a star upon your shoulder lighting up the path that you walk
With a parrot on your shoulder, saying everything when you talk
If you're ever feeling blue

I am the one who's privy too

So how are you feeling?
I don't think you can be dealing
With the situation very well
You take a lover for a dirty weekend, that's ok
But when it's over
You are looking at the working week through the eyes of a gigolo

You're kissing your elbow
You're kissing your reflection
And you can't understand why all the other boys are going for the
New, tall, elegant rich kids
You can bet it is a bitch, kid

Belle & Sebastian,"Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
Tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue
Do you went to work in Debenham's, because that's what they expect
Start in Lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor

And the head said that you always were a queer one from the start
For careers you say you went to be remembered for your art
Your obsessions get you known throughout the school for being strange
Making life-size models of the Velvet Underground in clay

In the queue for lunch they take the piss, you've got no appetite
And the rumour is you never go with boys and you are tight
So they jab you with a fork, you drop the tray and go berserk
While your cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt

You've been used, you're confused
Write a song, I'll sing along
Are you calm? Settle down
Soon you will know that you are sane

You're on top of the world again
Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school
Mum said she had little choice when she was young, so why should you?
Do you went to work in C&A, 'cause that's what they expect

Move to Ladieswear and take a feel off Joe the Storeman
Tell Veronica the secrets of the boy you never kissed 
She's got everything to gain 'cause she's a fat girl with a lisp
She sticks up for you when you get aggravation from the snobs

'Cause you can't afford a blazer and you're always wearing clogs
At the interval you lock yourself away inside a room 
Heed of English gets you, asks you, ""What the Hell do you think you're doing?""
""Do you think you're better then the other kids? Well get outside.""

You've got permission, but you've got to make the bastard think he's right",Expectations

The space between your bed and wardrobe with the louvre doors

The odor of old prison food takes a long time to pass you by
When you've been inside
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down
Nobody gives you a chance or a dollar in this old town

Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
Squalor and smoke's not your style

Then i compare notes with your older sister
I am a lazy get, she is as pure as the cold driven snow
She accepts my confession

Cell of your mind?

With his racist clientele

Belle & Sebastian,"I've been feeling down
I've been looking round the town
For somebody just like me
But the only ones I see
Are the dummies in the window
They spend their money on clothes
It saddens me to think
That the only ones I see are mannequins
Looking stupid, being used and being thin
And I don't know why I hang around with them

The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
The way they act, I'd rather be fat than be confused
Than be me in a cage
With a bottle of rage
And a family like the mafia

I've been feeling blue
And I don't know what to do
And I never get a thrill
And they threw me out of school
'Cause I swore at all the teachers
Because they never teach us
A thing I want to know
We do chemistry, biology and maths
I want poetry and music and some laughs
And I don't think it's an awful lot to ask

So won't you please get up off your knees, and let me go
So won't you please get up off your knees, and let me go
'Cause I'm here in a cage
With a bottle of rage
And a family like the mafia

Then I will change my name to Jones

Because you made me think about the times
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
The vision was a masterpiece of comic timing

But you wouldn't laugh at all
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
The picture was an old collage of something classical
The model with a tragic air

Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
The ghost of somebody at his side
I will confess to you
Because I didn't think about the message

As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
As the fraud I really was
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad

But I was so embarrassed when I missed your party
It was me that paid for it eventually

Because you know how much I wanted
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
The dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
And I'm no different from the rest

I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
The girl next door who's famous for showing her breasts
You're not impressed by me
But it's a funny way for you to tell me

A whisper in a choir stall
The man was talking about you simultaneously
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Because I have been sleeping badly lately

I'm telling you I caught the sun
Creeping up behind my shoulder
Another day's begun
I was following a trail
I'd never been along before
Chasing darkened skies above me
Looking like the spring
Like the winter
And the morning

If there's a place I want to go
Then I'll be there with you
Cause in my dreams the things
I'm wishing for
Keep coming true
Now a new day comes
Clears the darkness out of sight
And the shadows that were sleeping
Come and dance beneath the light
And I'm trying hard to hide
Keep the sun out of my eyes
Close them tight
And now I'm waiting for the moon to rise

Don't try to say to me
That this was never meant to be
Cause the days are long where I come from
The next few days I'm free
There's a train I want to catch
But it won't leave here for a while
Till darkness fills the eastern sky
And streetlights stretch for miles
Through the spring
And the winter and the morning",Waiting for the Moon to Rise
Belle & Sebastian,"I don't care whether you hear this
I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself
There's nobody else around, around
Meet you up at the Indian part of the town

The town's shut down, the people left with their bags
Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
But I must get from there to here
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here

It's too late to phone her now
What went wrong, your grades were good
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Your dad's a boozer and you keep him alive

Just a minute close your eyes
If we settle for this compromise I'll stay with you
The river looks so good tonight
I don't know what's with your friend

She met a boy and at the summer's end
She said she'd had enough of playing games
I don't care cause I'm by myself
All the dancers left but I can't dance

So I will stay and clean the mess they left behind
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl a rendezvous
Are you coming or are you not?

There is nothing that would sort you out
There's nothing I could say or do
You're going to crash, I'll set the bails in front of you
Are you coming or are you not?

There is nothing that would sort you out

Belle & Sebastian,"We were sitting in the living room on the sofa
The wrong way round, looking out the window.
It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road we saw Elvis  
""Look, there, beside the postman's van""
And he was walking round the postman's van,

Looking in the open door.
He looked as if he was thinking about getting in,
But then the postman came back,
And he swaggered off, walked past the window
And down the stairs,
And then at the bottom of the stairs right by the caretaker's office,
He started licking the pavement.

Every night now since we moved into that new house
There's this noise outside the door
At just about half seven or eight o'clock every night.
And if we go and look outside the door,

Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in.
And then he wanders into the living room
Maybe sits down on one of the chairs or even lies down on the floor.
He doesn't say much, he just stays there for an hour or two,

Watching the TV.
We talk to him a bit, and then around ten o'clock he'll go away again,
And not come back until the next night.
There's a lot of lanes and stuff around here, around the house.

Although it's right in the middle of the city it seems quite like the country,
It's dead hidden, safe I suppose,
Made for night living.
There's a lot of squirrels and birds,

And Stuart says he's seen about nine foxes there
When he's jumping over the fence on his way to Prior's road.
Sometimes you can go out walking,
And when you've been out for a wee while

Even you don't know where you are anymore,
So it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you.
I suppose that's why he spends so much here,
That's why he's come to live here,

Or maybe it's just the squirrels.
I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot.

There's these two videos that we got for wedding presents
Called the E-files, the E-files one and E-files two,
About how Elvis is supposed to be still alive.
And one time when he came round we were watching one of those,

But he didn't say anything, he just sat on the armchair.
He was playing with his collar a bit,
And we watched it all through,
And then when it finished he just got up
And walked off into the mist and didn't say anything.

The first few times he came round I didn't speak to him at all.
I wasn't really sure what to say. 
And Karen spoke to him quite a lot -
She seemed to know what to do more than I do.

He had quite a strange manner,
He'd just go into your stuff and look through it,
Then he'd maybe pick something up and play with it for a wee while,
But he'd never make any comment about any of it.

Seemed pretty rude to me.
I just watched whatever Karen did,
And listened to how she talked to him,
And then after a while I started to copy that

And tell him a few things,
Not really bothered about whether he responded or said anything back or not.

I think the first time I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine
And I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen,
And how it was that we'd come to be living here.
I thought he probably liked the fact that we were living here

Because he came round so much,
So I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about.

We did it all over backwards, I told him.
First of all we got to know each other,
And then a while after that we met,
And when we'd known each other for about seven years

We decided to have an anniversary, and that went quite well,
So after the anniversary we had a honeymoon, and that went well too.
So after that we decided that we would get married,
And that's why we're living here now.

I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream
It stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day.

Got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed
Cause I cured her on the Sabbath
I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whiskey and gin
To whiskey and gin.

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel
Called The State That I'm In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said okay
Now I spend my days turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again
The state that I am in.

I gave myself to sin, I gave
Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again

Cause I am stupid and blind

Oh and now I'm feeling dangerous

Why don't you lead me to a living end

You made me forget my dreams
I was building a space rocket
With the boy who played bass guitar
With the boy who's wearing flares
He didn't care
He lit the fuse and ran for a mile
The space rocket went up in style
The space rocket went up in style

I'll lend you two hundred quid
For a flight across the ocean
Maybe things will look better there
Because they couldn't be much worse
Than tears and a curse
For men with guns, maturing in age
Will always pay a shitty wage
They'll always pay a shitty wage

You made me forget my dreams
When i woke up to you sleeping
There was blood on the sheets again
And the view outside the window
Of gardens in bloom
Obscured by all the trouble we had
I think i better make a move
I think i better make a move",You Made Me Forget My Dreams

She must be nearly freezing
Who's that girl out there
All that snow makes it hard so see her
Did she wave to me 

And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough
That stuff, that stuff

Made a film
I made it through the window
Who's that star I cast?
All wrapped up in her winter wardrobe
She hurries by so fast

And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough

I'll admit today I've gone too far
To enamor myself of my little motor car

I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes but
I won't see you

I've got a tongue like a little slug

Belle & Sebastian,"I need someone to take some joy in something I do
You need a man who's either rich or losing a screw
You know I love you here's the irony
You're going to walk away intact

You like yourself and you like
Men to kiss your arse
Expensive clothes
Please stop me there
I think I'm waking up to us
We're a disaster
You don't want to know me
'cause you move in circles of the brave
Where art defines their lives

She was the one love of my life, and I let her go
And if I look like death today
Then please let her know
I never wanted to do harm to her
I only wanted her to see
The beauty of the world surrounding her
But when she opened up her eyes
It's much too late
Our chance has gone
She's with a guy
Who takes the price for everything I ever showed her
Digging all the fun
Because she's older
I fed her with a spoon
I made her mother smile
I helped the kid survive

She was the one love of my life
She showed me the road
I loved her dog, her steady gaze, the chapter is closed
I always wanted all the best for her
The best thing was to stay away
She grew up and she left the rest of us
And now the understanding's gone
I haven't changed, how could I
I'm pretty much the same person
I cannot keep the anger hidden anymore
But lucky for you, you are not around
My anger turns to pity and to love

Takes a second to think what to do
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak

For years and years he's done nothing but bow down
And put up with all their demands
She sits like a viper and offers the clock
Without giving a damn

Honor forbids me, but honor be damned
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the working when things were going badly
You left us to rot

He locked the door of the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he's lost
He is drunk with it all

You only came back to us when we'd turned it around
When we'd rescued your arse from the fire
Your contribution to all that we did
Was to say it was dire

Night after day after night I've been working
Despite of you fucking us all
Now I'm gonna die, I don't care if you cry
Just please leave me alone

And spare your tears for yourself

I'm sitting on a jet plane
I'll see my baby soon enough
I won't take her to the movie

But all their words and actions come entirely from you

If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility
And you can lead your characters anywhere you want
You have immunity

People might react to all the things that your characters say?
And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray?
Are you sick?
Are you crippled? Insane?

Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name?

Lost to the world he had known as a boy
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Passing along and as sleepy as night
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
He is accustomed to hiding from people

Taking his time as he crosses the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in shadows to his senorita

Safe in the dawn he gets under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
That was put there to save and protect him

He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be set by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it

Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and God listens to him

How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase

San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may
I love you

I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
""You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job""
Maybe, but not what she deserves

Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like ""Walk Away, Renee""
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour","Piazza, New York Catcher"

A breeze whips through the trees
The rustling leaves and branches bend together they're cued to sway
Forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography

Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars they saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years

Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And ""Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart""
He might be nursing a broken heart
But feeling this way he's just playing a part

You said ""Walk before you crawl""

Like a miner trapped inside

She will in me doubts confide
And she's on me like a blanket
Like a stalk of wilting grass
I'm not sure about her motives
I'm not sure about her past

But my faith is like a bullet
My belief is like a bolt
The only thing that lets me sleep at night
A little carriage of the soul
If it starts a little bleaker
Then the year may yet be gold
Happiness is not for keeping
Happiness is not my goal

But what about me
I don't really see
How things will improve

To a gaggle of gangling youth
All you want is to stay loose

Television is hysterical laughter of people

I keep running around in circles
I keep looking for a doorway
I'm going to need two lives
To follow the paths I've been taking",Stay Loose
Belle & Sebastian,"She called me up today
Meet me down at the old cafe
I jumped into the shower
I was getting my marching orders

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

She'd never stand for any lies
She's got an Out Tray full of guys
I could sense a breath, a whole new feeling
Now she says she wants to call a meeting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

I'm a slave to work
I'm only living when I walk amongst the office staff
And catch up with the office wag
I'll be in bed by nine
My curtains drawn
My thoughts composed
I get to work on time

She gave me some dictation
But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I'm want to give you the job
I'm pushing for a raise
I've been pushing now for days

My output is in decline
I was burned out after Thatcher
My banner I laid down with a sigh
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her

I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A sharp suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly

Have you shaved for work yet baby
Don't go out the boss is waiting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime

Belle & Sebastian,"It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you're far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We've never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths that I could follow
I'd write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
I know it will be fine
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer's hastening on
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city
But I've been unfaithful
I've been travelling abroad

We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks",Wrapped Up in Books
Belle & Sebastian,"Since you went away, everything is looking great
I'm a little bored
When I see you out, maybe walking in the street
You always cross the road

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore
You don't send me anymore

Our little scene is getting smaller by the day
It's a human zoo
But the key is change, getting over all your problems
You're not a fool

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to surprise me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me
You don't send me 

Every sound is tame, every group the bleedin' same
It would make you mad
What happened to the sounds that left you lying on the floor
Laughing, crying, jumping, singing

Listen honey, there is nothing you can say to astound me
Listen honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me anymore
You don't send me anymore",You Don't Send Me
Belle & Sebastian,"I'm sick, and I've felt this way for some time now
I'm so fed up with the daily grind
I'm trying to find relief
If you feel this way then clap your hands
Ever thought this was a backward land?
What is making people mean?
A bad scene

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I'm tired, on my shoulders weighing heavily
Is the full responsibility for your troubles and your charms
Your betrayal goes around with me
Like the sword in some old tragedy
It is sticking in my back
People laugh

Now that I've got my motives straight and I am thinking clearly
I'll sneak up to your window with my senses open wide

I never really thought it would be like this
I know it's kind of hard but I'm glad that it is

Belle & Sebastian,"Animals come, banging their drums
Street clears in summer
Kids run around, having their fun
Men are already drunk

A religious holiday's begun
Maybe it's because we have no sun

Marching begins, animals sing
Words that are twisted to
Meanings of hate, look at the face
Bitter and ready to fight

A religious holiday's begun
Maybe it's because we have no sun

Lost in the crowd
Shouting loud
Drinking my fill of a bottle of gin
I'll do anything to help me forget about you

You're full of it
You hopelessly flirt
With that girl who works in the pub for a night
But at closing time
You will be at my door
Tell me what it is I have to do?
I'd sacrifice everything for you

I was feeling so good and the sun was shining
All I wanted was to get across the street
I made my biggest mistake when I left her
With a yelling match and a broken kettle
I'm sick of this, you're a little kid
I always have to bail you out
When you take off with your drinking friends
And their idiot games
If you sing the songs you half deserve to take a beat

They beat me up because I crossed the march
They said I need to learn a bit of respect
But I am on their side and I follow the team
When I get out of here
Somebody's going to get it",Love on the March
Belle & Sebastian,"""So how do we know each other?
And how do you have my number?
Well why don't you guide me
You be the driver""

Say what you want and leave your shyness home
And you should do what you want and write a little poem
Leave it for her and live another day
And you should leave it for her, the girl around the way

Write down a list of things you wanna do
And then you leave it in work because you wanna live a little
Pick up the girl in someone's borrowed Mini
Take her to dinner, use her boyfriend's money

Hey lady, put the phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I wanna see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown

Planning a freak is such a tricky thing
Because you move through the country, she comes back again
And then you move through the city, but she goes abroad
Is she telling you something, is she getting bored?

I make a rough plan to sleep around a minaret
I need a change, I'm a lazy rat if I am honest
But my bold change of tact will fade out with the summer
I've got no appetite and all the girls are bummers

My baby doesn't look at me the way I want her to look
She doesn't comprehend
My baby's got it going on
She's got a friend in every street in this town

I want to go out but there's nobody home-
I'll go on my own

Thus starts the lonely walking
There's always too much talking
I, I, I should have stayed home
She starts her cold caressing
The kid she starts undressing
I, I, I should have stayed home
The DJ's picking up speed
That's something I just don't need
I, I, I should have stayed home
The gossip's bearing down on me
The kids are pairing up in front of me
I should have stayed home
I should have stayed home
I think I'll go home

Listen lady, put your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Listen lady, leave your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Hey lady, meet my mom and dad
You're a strange operation in this land of potted plants
And funslide houses where the girls like mouses
Breathe a long sigh of resignation
You resign yourself to keep on growing
Like the seeds you're sowing
For a strange operation in this land of grammar schools
And galloped days, the lady's set in her way
Behind a long conversation from a kid named Stole
He's a little slow but in your favour it shows
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to move out to the sticks

Listen lady, leave the boy home
Cancel all operations, tell your friends there's more to you than this",Your Cover's Blown
Belle & Sebastian,"To step out of your cradle is like coming down
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
I'll be a dozer if I can
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret

You could tell me all your secrets
All you ever do is run and hide
You can keep it inside
If you tell me all your secrets
All I have to do is let it ride
I can keep it inside
But if it's as it seems, and I keep having dreams
About the two of us, then it's obvious
You should stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start treating me like I was just the same as you

To step out of your cradle is like coming down
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
I'll be a dozer if I can
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret

We could be a little closer
The mystery you're trying to preserve
You don't need in reserve
We should be a little closer
Intimacy has the greater charm
And it would do no harm
To give a little way, oh, please stop holding away
You could even read me your poetry
If you would stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start realising that I'm just as wild as you
Stop treating me like I was just a child",Your Secrets

Belle & Sebastian,"I'm glad to see you
I had a funny dream
You were wearing funny shoes
You were going to a dance
You were dressed like a punk but you are too young to remember

Glad to see you
I'm outside the house
I'm not thinking well today
I've got no energy
I'm glad that you are waiting with me
Tell me all about your day

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'm happy for you
You've made it hard for me
I counted on your company
You are staying with your friends tonight
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I keep taking everything to be a sign

I'm happy for you
Now I know this hurt is poison
Too sharp to be bled
I'm sitting on my empty bed
On my empty bed
At night the fever grows it's pounding pounding

I'd rather be in Tokyo
I'd rather listen to Thin Lizzy-oh
Watch the Sunday gang in Harajuku
There's something wrong with me, I'm a cuckoo

Scary moment, lovin' every moment
I was high from playing shows
We lost a singer to her clothes
My trouble raised its ugly head
I was revealed
And I was home in bed
I was a kid again

Jesus told me, go after every coin like it was the last in the world
And protect the wayward child
But I'm a little lost sheep
I need my Bo Peep
I know I need My Shepherd here tonight

Breaking off is misery
I see a wilderness for you and me
Punctuated by philosophy
And a wondering how things could've been

I'd like to see you
But really I should stay away
And let you settle down
I've got no claims to your crown
I was the boss of you
And I loved you
You know I loved you
It's all over now

I was there for you
When you were lonely
I was there when you were sad
I was there when you were bad
Now it's my time of need
I'm thinking, do I have to plead to get you by my side?

I live alone the silence it can take you
I live alone the silence it can break you after a while
Not long ago I made a deal, the ghosts around the house all seem to like me

My life is falling down I am confounded
My life is falling down I am dumbfounded, what a mess

At the heroes of my youth.
And their antics on the page there on
Can no longer sustain me
Ever since I was a boy
They brought me joy
But the shackles of the way I was
Can no longer contain me

It was exciting
And enlightening
Reverberating through my dreams
Goodbye to reality
And set a course for wayward schemes.

I can't feel

I lived the book
I got the haircut
That's all it took
But now I know it's going to take

Now I'm waiting for the phone to ring

When you laid me
Could we try to spice it up?'

I looked across the table
First to see if she was joking
No joke
There was no flicker
Just a girl who wanted more

Than meat and potatoes
She may stop at whips and chains
She needs carousal
More arousal
A bit of pain

So we started by using handcuffs
We tried a can of cold whipped cream
I was allergic to so much dairy
She had to finish it all by herself

Then I slapped her
She wasn't expecting
So she hit me back
She friggin' cracked me
I got a nose bleed
She was angry
She wanted more

Than mean and potatoes
She may stop at pumps and drains!
She needs carousal
More arousal
A bit of pain

Invite the neighbours
Or total strangers
Give yourself a leg up, honey
Wear 'The Queen' mask
Put on the French basque
It's full of handy holes
If we're going to use them all
We're going to need more than

Belle & Sebastian,"I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood

Like a fresh manifestation of an old phenomenon
A breeze whips through the trees
The rustling leaves and branches bend together
They're cued to sway
Forever by the forces of the Lord's choreography
I wandered all night, I wondered all night about you
I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood

Just for a second the combination of sights, sounds around him
Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all of his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars
They saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years

I wondered
I wondered
I wondered all night about you

Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And 'Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart'
He might be nursing a broken heart
But feeling this way he's just playing a part
That's been around for centuries

I've been here for years just wandering around the neighbourhood",Roy Walker [DVD][Live]
Belle & Sebastian,"What do you do when hope is all but gone?
You need a brother to lean on
But your brother's gone
Your sister's in the wrong part of town
I took a walk to remember ecstasy
It's not today, not even yesterday

Songs of praise all very well 
Their voices swell
They tug at sadness
Like love tugging at your sleeve
Is it worth the pain
To walk into the void again?
In your darkest hour he is the tiniest light

Light that's found beyond your present situation
And it's wide and it's broad, beyond all estimation

Is your belly fat, is your man a twat? 
Do in-growing hairs provide you with strange fascination?
The highlight of your day is plucking all the roots away
You took a walk to remember ecstasy
It's not today, not even yesterday

In your darkest hour he is the tiniest light
The smallest of sparks
He's a tinderbox, he's a flaming torch
Pinch your self quite hard, in a place that hurts
If it doesn't work, ask your friend to comply
And if they hit the spot
You can let yourself cry
And when the teardrops stop, I will take you for a drive
I'll explain all I know about the spiritual side

Life that's found beyond your present situation
And it's wide and it's broad, beyond all estimation",The Life Pursuit
Belle & Sebastian,"Saw a suit in Daddy’s wardrobe, I took a swipe
Lapels, size of islands, gangster white line pinstripe
Laughed off the street in the name of my rock ‘n’ roll
Still a caterwauling groove will start off vacation 
Eighties plastic Soul don’t give palpitation
Richie, he no like, he call out the firing squad

Ba ba ba

Richie look for suede, me I look for leather
Sartorially we groove, occasional disaster
For tight black canvas no make for a straight legged sixties scenester
Then we hit the street with poise of commando
Clothes, guitar but arsenal missing one thing
Exotic Glasgow chick, they call her the ‘Carmen Veranda’

Ba ba ba

Me and Richie dream to be like Mr Richard
Strung out secure yes we make like junkie
Hooked up on that stuff they call it the rock ‘n’ roll
I need to consecrate, I need consecration
Clipped and soulful guitar riffing out the nation
The nation in my head the national sixties sensation

Ba ba ba",Mr Richard
Belle & Sebastian,"Morning prayers took the girl unawares
She was late for class and she knew it
The broadcaster had a voice that was soothing
She couldn't tell if it was a man or woman
A patch of sun fell onto her neck
She put her head on her arms on her desk

The lesson today was Acts of Apostles
The crazy hippies, they're running scared
She shut her eyes and imagined the desert
No cars, no mobiles, just sun and bread
What would she look like standing by the well?
More like a women and less like a girl

Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?

Later on she plays Morning Has Broken
She knows she's bad
She is slowing everybody down
The choirmaster, usually a bastard, knows her mother's sick
He'll be nice to her
She thinks that she shouldn't be there at all
Her worries make everything else seem trivial

Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?",Act of the Apostle
Belle & Sebastian,"I'm bored out my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in senior year
It gives you a little free time
I'll just use it all at once!

Took the fence and the lane
The bus then the train
Bought an 'Independent' to make me look like I got brains
I made a story up in my head if anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar!

I'm a genius
A prodigy
A demon at Maths and Science
I'm up for a prize
If you gotta grow up sometime
You've to do it on your own
I don't think I could stand to be stuck
That's the way that things were going

The bible's my tool
There's no mention of school!
My Damascan Road's my transistor radio
I tune in at night when my mum and my dad start to fight
I put on my headphones
And I tune out
I am devout
The girls are singing about my life
But they're not here, they've got the wild life

If you want to find out, find out
You got to look them in the eye
That's why my only choice
Is find the face behind the voice?.

She asked the man if the service was open
Not today, just the choir from the radio
Couldn't I sit in? I've come all this way
Will you bugger off, I've got work to do.

The city was losing its appeal
God was asleep
He was back in her village, in the fields

Oh, if I could make sense of it all!
I wish that I could sing
I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song
What would I do to believe?",Act of the Apostle II
Belle & Sebastian,"Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees

Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 

Another day in June, we'll pick eleven for football
We're playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds

Everybody's gone you picked me up for a long drive
We take the tourist route the nights are light until midnight
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still

There's something in my eye a little midge so beguiling
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again

'The lovin is a mess what happened to all of the feeling'
I thought it was for real; babies, rings and fools kneeling
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart",Another Sunny Day
Belle & Sebastian,"Look at the kid from school
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The tracksuits are old, and the hoody's way too moody
For a kid with the will to funk
He dances in secret; he's a part-time punk

She's getting off the plane
She wants to write a thesis on the population underprivileged
The kids fighting up the lane
Shop lifting, just drifting
Like The Switchblade And The Cross
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
She's taking an elementary class in Kung fu

I left my washing in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my washing
The black will be grey and the white will be grey
But the blues are still blue

I'm crying out for my mum
If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
With the boss of the company
I'm a singer, a swinger I'm a layabout but laying on
The dock in the lazy sun
Will never quite relegate me to a bum

I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my lady
The black will be white and the white will be black
But The Blues Are Still Blue

Baby, I love your face
I've been creeping round this town because?
Well, creeping's just my way
But with a little wink I'll be there
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
I know your young, but you're out of touch
You're French, your vocabulary's not quite formed

I left my homework in the launderette
I got a letter from my mamma which my stupid dog has ate
I hid behind the fence
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
He's not making much sense

I left my lady in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet

Every morning I see your picture from the train
Now you're an actress!
So says your resume

You couldn't act your way out of a paper bag

You always had a lot of style
I'd hate to see you on the pile
Of ?nearly-made-it' s

If I could have a second skin
I'd probably dress up in you

For the price of a night with me
You'd be the village joke
For the price of a pint of milk
I'll tell you all I know
About the state of the world today
Sit down, enjoy the show

She had several hours to find a place to stay
Try the coffee shop, but somewhere on the way
She heard about a place, somewhere she could go
Walked a couple of blocks to her destination

For the price of a cup of tea
You'd get a seven inches
Soul black vinyl to stop your tears
You can use my stereo
You might be the village joke but
Don't listen to the gossip of the other folk

She just wants to be accepted in this place
There's something in her face
She will always seem exotic and aloof
If you want to know the truth
Her friend the stars dripping from the jewelled sky
When she was passing by
Would keep her calm
There was people that she knew, at least she thought she did
Be easy on the kid!

Pushed back her fringe, see her birthmark
She can finally be the person she wanted to be",For the Price of a Cup of Tea

You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall

I am the jester in the ancient court
You're the funny little frog in my throat

My eye sight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself I've been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
She gets the all highlights wrapped in pearls.

I had a conversation with you at night
It's a little one sided but that's alright
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You've come to save my life again

I don't dare to touch your hand
I don't dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don't know how you smell

I'll maybe tell you all about it someday",Funny Little Frog
Belle & Sebastian,"Mornington Crescent
I think of you
Rain in the southeast
Men feeling blue
Men with their bowlers
Kids with their spats
Ladies with chauffeurs
Dogs wearing hats and jackets
Rich apartments
Old punk posters
Tartan garments
I love the exquisite array
I love the camp as camp parade
The possibilities suggest themselves to me
I'm feeling free

The sun in the east
I've got a job on 
For a Senegalese rich arbitrator
In African law
To paint his apartment, strip down the walls
Came down between us lately
Lust and want and need just caved in
'Is it wise?'
The answer's no
It never is but since you ask
We pause thoughtfully, for twenty seconds reprieve
Then it's off with the briefs

Sin is my game
We'll all be lined up
Irrelevant fame
Next to the broker, the nurse and the drunk

Millions of people never start in the race
There's stuff on out plates that has not been alive
Someone pays full price for my cheap flight life

Sunshine, we all see the same sky

I am a man filled with longing desire
The gifts of creation are ready for hire
A look and a label are all I require
Enough's not enough, I never ask why

Sunshine, we all see the same sky
Looking, learning, asking the same 'why?'?

Belle & Sebastian,"Sukie was the kid, she liked to hangout in the graveyard
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
When she finished hanging out she was all alone
She decided that she better check in at home
There was an awful row between her mum and dad
They said she hadn't done this, she hadn't done that
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
It didn't suit Sukie
So she took her things and left

Sukie was the kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
She took a bijou flat with the fraternity cat
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
She said 'Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich'
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
He got her meals and he got her a bed
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
He never got far
Just lookin' and playing guitar

Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Sukie saw the beauty but she wasn't wet behind the ears
She had an A1 body and a face to match
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
They served steamed puddings she went without
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
Peeling away everything she had
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark

Looking for the pleasure that he knew was so far gone
So far gone
I took a turn to myself
And I was surprised, cause I saw everyone who ever I had loved
I felt a whole lot better after that

People look at us and they think were doing fine
People look at us cause they see us all the time
All the time
But they never take to us
We've been in this town so long we may as well be dead
So long as people turn their heads
And cross the street whenever we walk on by

The beauty of the moment is the beauty sadly lost

Valentino's own, passed down from the throne
With powers to use with discretion
Through hallowed hall
Through streetlight stroll
Through winter snow, the scarf's a-flying
He can feel salvation coming around
This time he knows it exists

Of a handsome romantic that no girl could resist

The noose of innocence, it was tightening

And now there's ice in your heart
You kissed the girls, you notched them up

Maybe we'll get some bowling and drinking in
And looking at the sky

Why does your lazy eye rest on his skin
His arm, and his wallet too?

Take a look around you
The spring has sent the sound of rain upon your windowsill
So grab your coat and play a song for me

Don't think that I've forgotten
We've grown up, but I know the reason
I want to curl up in your room

That's why we're on the late shift
JP at Maida Vale
I've got my clothes dry-cleaned
To commemorate the day

Take a look around you
The spring has sent the sound of rain upon your windowsill
So grab your coat and play a song for me

And now my legs are weak,
But if I hear my baby speak then I'll start running
She's got miraculous technique

If I could be a song
I would be something that would snake into your room
And be with you the whole night long",(My Girl's Got) Miraculous Technique

Dreaming of the time when you're free
From all the trouble you're in

Being a rebel is fine
But you go all the way to being brutal

Kiss arses and pay tribute
But I'm inclined today to do those things anyway
And I don't care who hears it

'Cause I'm a fan of the Go-Betweens
A fan of Robert, and I always have been
But I like Grant, now that I've met him

I'd take him home, to my mum and dad
Yeah, he's charming, but he's a trouble-maker too
He amuses me greatly

Pete stole the set list, and the itinerary
He wrote my name down as 'Tour Rent Boy'
It was hard, but so is life


I was making button badges
And I had too much time on my hands
I coloured them by hand

Kids came in to watch me
But Pete & Sean just scorned
Just like they scorned Robert
But I secretly loved the big guy

Belle & Sebastian,"I will confess to you
Because you made me think about the times
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
The vision was a masterpiece of comic timing

But you wouldn't laugh at all
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
The picture was an old collage of something classical
The model with a tragic air

Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
The ghost of somebody at his side
I will confess to you
Because I didn't think about the message

As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
As the fraud I really was
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad

'Cause Lisa learned a lot from putting on a blindfold
When she knew she had been bad
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
It was the best sex she ever had

I'll send a dress to you
Because it's needing badly taken in
But I was so embarressed when I missed your party
It was me that paid for it eventually

Because you know how much I wanted
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
The dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
And I'm no different from the rest

I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
The girl next door who's famous for showing her breasts
You're not impressed by me
But it's a funny way for you to tell me

A whisper in a choir stall
The man was talking about you simultaneously
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Because I have been sleeping badly lately

I know you were historical from all the books I've read
But I thought you could be bluffing
And with this chance I've missed I feel remiss
It's days and months before I see you again",The Model [Live]
Belle & Sebastian,"I could hang about and burn my fingers
I've been hanging out here waiting for something to start
You think I'm faultless to a 't'

But underneath I am the same as you 
I could dance all night like I'm a soul boy
But I know I'd rather drag myself across the dance floor
I feel like dancing on my own

Where no one knows me, and where I
Can cause offence just by the way I look
And when I come to blows
When I am numbering my foes

Just hope that you are on my side my dear
But it's best to finish as it started
With my face head down just staring at the brown formica
It's safer not to look around

I can't hide my feelings from you now

You say I've got another face

Lost to the world he had known as a boy
He knows his lover lies south in the city
Passing along and as sleepy as night
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
He is accustomed to hiding from people

Taking his time as he crosse the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in shadows to his senorita

Safe in the dawn he gest under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
That was put there to save and protect him

He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be set by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it

Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and God listens to him

Sir all I want is a chance to amend
Past infidelities please do not send
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise
Me far away from my wise Senorita",Wandering Alone [Live]

It's best to be enslaved

It's better still to love first
It's harder still to love first

You're my winter queen that disappeared
Your hands grew cold
You ran a mile from my ways
I still heard you had a fourth floor view
With lots of time
A notebook full of the finest, creamy, rich girl parchment pages
Slowly fill with all your passing days
Every sacred word paints a picture

Bigger were his muscles
Than father ? 
But when you are in trouble
And when you are uptight

I get the midnight phone call
I'm your captain for the long haul

Was it just your fate?

Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

And she's beautiful, sure

Belle & Sebastian,"Born on a Sunday, everyday is Monday
That is what I've heard about the real world
Up on the morning,
Heading for the schoolyard
Big boys being bullies make it so hard

It's a lesson for the real world
Seems so far away the real world

Up to the bigger school
Trying not to be fool
Hear I am new shoes and cagoule
Look I'm getting closer to the real world
(""Tell me where the girls are?"")

Thinking about happiness
Thinking about Tara
Thinking about sorrow
Thinking about Sara
Sorrow and Sara are the very same word

In my young life I get so hurt
Will I make it in the real world?

Gluing up my Airfix kit
Cigarettes after gym
Had a pint of Special Brew
Won't do that again

Train for examination, got me traction.
Mickey mouse college course,
Looking for action
Play guitar, stacking shelves
Holding back in the real world

Now it's Monday morning,
I'm still yawning
Scuffing down the city street
Heading for the clock on
Bought a Daily Record like a real man

Well I made it to the real world
But I'm not living in the real world",I'm Not Living in the Real World
Belle & Sebastian,"Love and pain and sorrow
Keep the band together

She was like my soulmate
Whispered in my ear

Love was playing music
It was all we wanted

Making plastic records
Of our history

How I knew it mattered
To a certain person
Heard the boy in London
Called out from the crowd

Said something that I could tell me 10 years later
Wishing that he still called like he called that night

Pulling songs from thin air?
Pulling songs from bridges
Smell the air in small town
Where the train line stops?

Ever will I love you?
Now your chapter's over
Ever will I love you
You were good to me

Now I'm in memory?
Is a cherished story
Moan about the present
And arrayed the past

Love is like a novel
Read the blessed pages

Did I do my best dear?
That is all you ask",Read the Blessed Pages
Belle & Sebastian,"There is no hole in which to hide
There is no plane to catch
No hotel room that's warm enough
No rent to a room that's quiet

A friend I've known through six degrees
Cools down to where I hide
A friend I've known through dreams and prayers
She comes back to my side

You're so far from wanting to talk
You're so far from wanting to say something good
Feel something good

The secret lives and loves of girls
The secret lives of boys
The storm, we are the both of us
Too close to ever love

Whisky from the Island of Sund
Whisky from the year you were born
Tastes like kidnap and ransom and exile

Somebody asked me what hell was like
Somebody asked me for help
Somebody asked me what hell was like
Lunging and happening, panting of souls

Every boy you ever desired
Every love you ever forgot

Belle & Sebastian,"I know a spell
That would you make help
Write about love, it could be in any tense, but it must make sense

I know a trick
Forget that you are sick
Write about love, it could be in any form, hand it to me in the morning

I hate my job, I'm working way too much (every day I'm stuck in an office)
At one o'clock, I take my lunch up on the roof
The city's spread below, I'll write about a man
He's intellectual and he's hot, but he understands

The seconds move on (if you watch the clock)
And the sky grows dark (if you're looking up)
But the girls move from thrill to thrill on the tightrope walk (on the tightrope walk)

Belle & Sebastian,"Shyness hanging like a wendy
Bad clothes keep you in the village hall
Sunday nothing for the rest of us
Sunday listen to your spirits soar
Thank you thank you for the holiday
We talk sometimes in a quiet world
Three years diggin' all the scenery
Black walls cloudy as a sea of gulls

Let the summer go
Let tomorrow take care of itself
If you believe like you tell me so
Hand in hand your lover will be every sweet and hungry soul

Stage school falling like a summer end
Trees strip wrap yourself in color brown
Some ?? ?? the capricorn
Bell rings summer need to feeling warm
Mornings must have thought about you
All night reach out with a single call
Not my place to be your confidante
I just thought I'd catch you as you fall

Let tomorrow take care of itself

Belle & Sebastian,"I'm sitting around at the checkpoint
Keeping myself to myself
My heart's going out to the girl with the gun
She is young, she is fun, she is deadly

She clocks off, goes back to the city
Goes to a club with her friends

I just took a walk through the checkpoint
Past columns of poor Arab sons
They queue through the day for a chance to make pay
For something to put in their mouths

He can't sleep at night without gunfire
The lullaby puts him to sleep

We stand there accused of the British collusion
Israel into Palestine
A victory for some an astonishing hope
But for him it has brought devastation
He lives like a prisoner in exile
He lives like a prisoner in hell

Dates black and white in the blue vault of space
Swoop around like a symbol of peace
Can they see the hawk?
They're too busy in talk of love
Why should they contemplate fear?

Everyone meets in the cramped city streets
Hipsters of zion collide
To talk music and dross
At the sign of The Cross
We eat our falafel in peace
The girl lets her uniform slip
The boy cracks a joke he is sweet
He listens to Hip Hop in Gaza
She listens to Coldplay in Lod",The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House
Belle & Sebastian,"Make me dance, I want to surrender
Your familiar arms, I remember
We've been going transcontinental
Got no car, we just take a rental

But we don't have the money

Forget about it, honey

Make me dance, I want to surrender

I didn't see it coming

Belle & Sebastian,"Here I stand, my angel
With a three quartz broken heart
You said the grass was greener
You knew that from the start
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Got my bread from the baker
Two-bit crusty roll
Sang my song to the savior
And down the road I go
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Any day now, see me walking
Hear me knocking on your front door
Catch a bus, catch a train
Catch a plane, it's all the same
It's the last trip to my baby's arms tonight

Dreaming of her ways
Her caressing, my obsessing
She made me cry
As I walk along, find myself smiling
I'm about to lose my broken heart
On the last trip to my baby's arms tonight",Last Trip
Belle & Sebastian,"My friend,
She wants,
To be a suicide girl.
I'll take her picture,
For the whole wide world.
I've known her for a long time,
You could say that I'm a fan,
But I always thought that I would be her man.

My friend,
She wants,
To be the girl of suicide.
She wants a number,
For her radical side.
I know that she is special,
I can see what she has got,
But without her gloves and garnered clothes (?)
She will take them to the world,
Exposed, she gives it all away.

My friend,
She sometimes gets anxiety and stress.
She got a man,
From the NHS.
She proclaims a week of sadness!
She's abstained from telling jokes!
The world will see her poor image, (?)
A butterfly to empathy.
I know that I can do it,
I'm in to light, I'm in to shade.
But let's face the facts,
We ain't goin' back,
When she takes off her clothes we'll never be the same again!",Suicide Girl
Belle & Sebastian,"Say what you want and leave your shyness home
Do what you want and write a little poem
Leave it for her and live another day
Leave it for her the girl around the way

Planning a break is such a tricky thing
Because you move to the country, she comes back again
And then you move to the city but she goes abroad
Is she telling you something, is she getting bored?

I'll make a rough plan to sleep around, I'm in a rut
I need a change, I'm a lazy rat if I am honest
My bold change of tack will fade out with the summer
I've got no appetite and all the girls are bummers

My baby doesn't look at me
The way I want her to
She doesn't comprend

I want to go out but there's nobody home
I'll go on my own

There's always too much talking
I should have stayed home
She starts her cool caressing
The kid, she starts undressing in front of me
I should've stayed home

That's something I just don't need

You're a strange aberration
In this land of potted plants and boxlike houses
Where the girls like mouses
Breathe a long sigh of resignation
You resign yourself to keep on growing
All the seeds you're sowing
You're a strange apparition
In this land of grammar schools and gala days
The ladies set in their ways
You had a long conversation
With the kid next door

But in your favour, it shows

Belle & Sebastian,"Sitting at the old kitchen table
Peace and health and dreams
Stretching out in the darkness
Mother's up the stairs with her ageing new boyfriend
Cathy's staying in to make sure nothing happens
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray
I'm praying for the light

Down amongst the old city chambers
Men in frocks debate all the policy changes
Everybody bet on the boom and got busted
Everybody bet and in the government trusted
Grubby little red MP
Yellow flapping hopelessly

Tory like the cat with the cream
Tory like the cat with the cream
I studied you in history
I studied in the library
In days of old when knights were bold
They'd settle it with swords and shields
In days of old when knights were bold
It's settled by the king

Praying for a friend is contagious
'Specially when it comes at the old kitchen table
Listening for the swoosh of his quickening paces
Watching for the smile on the bravest of faces
How I wish you'd read to me
Verses rich in swallows and trees
To get me though the night

Waiting at the old kitchen table
Listening for my code, listening for my instructions
Surely now I'm here, I am destined for greatness
I want to be the Queen pulling kids out of rivers
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray

I'm praying for the cat with the cream

Belle Stars,"On her way to work one morning
Down the path along side the lake
A tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew

""poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in and I'll take care of you""
""Take me in oh tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk
And then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk 
Now she hurried home from work that night as soon as she arrived 
She found that pretty snake she'd taking in had been revived
""Take me in, oh tender woman 
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

Now she clutched him to her bosom, ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried
""But if I hadn't brought you in by now you might have died""
Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight 
But instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite
""Take me in, oh tender woman 
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

""I saved you,"" cried that woman
""And you've bit me even, why?
You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die""
""Oh shut up, silly woman,"" said the reptile with a grin 
""You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in 
""Take me in, oh tender woman 
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out

I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days
Every now and again
I pretend I'm ok but that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
Not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see your old friends and I'm alone

Still harder
Getting up, getting dressed
Dealing with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade
Give away
All the words that I say
Through my heart that I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
Not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do

Is what I was trying to do

And having so much to say
And watching you walk away

",What Hurts the Most
Bellefire,"I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you

I break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door

I never put wet towels on the floor anymore
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me

And soon you'll see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk
So I pick up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain

I saw a movie, it just was wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad
Dreams last for so long

Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you'll see
You were meant for me

And I was meant for you
I go about my business
I'm doin' fine
Besides what would I say

If I had you on the line
Same old stort, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on

I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick up a book, turn the sheets down
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my p.j's and hop into bed

I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try to tell myself it'll be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon I know you'll see

You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah...
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you",You Were Meant for Me
Belleruche,"Lessons to be learnt but who's going to teach
Who's writing the rules, well I decree
A day of tragedy when love is lost
When a friend, when a friend is pissed off

Misunderstandings are so unfair
Psychoanalyse me please oh my friend
Let's begin, let confusion unravel around me

And, and if I give the pieces together
The way they make sense to me I'll do my best
But I can use only what I've seen from where I've been
And the lives that have lived before me
Who's going to look, who's going to cheek
No one can really say 'cause they're all dead
But we can try and only try to live with integrity

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here and

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek

Oh no there's will and there's fate
Or random explosions everyday
Or is the world an orchestrated play
Or a clock, tick-tock, a clock work game
Us being the cogs and the product is time
Questions to evolve with the answers to find
Like what the hell, what the hell are we doing here anyhow

Yeah a gift it is to have everything
To fill our lines with happiness and what we desire
But only if you want it, only if you need it
Only if you brave it, only if you seek it
So be kind 'cause there's a piece of me in you
I'll be kind 'cause there's a piece of you in me
A piece of everyone somewhere elsewhere lesser and greater

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here

So come and see if from
Come and see if from
Come and see it from here and

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Oh let's begin tonight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek
Script you write and forces you fight

Whatever you seek
Which book you may read
Which planet you seek

Oh no there's will and there's fate

Bellowhead,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam",Amsterdam
Bellowhead,"The Earl of Rosslyn's daughter walked through the woods alone
When by came Captain Wedderburn, a servant of the king
He said unto his servant-man, ""Were it not against the law
""I'd take her into my own bed, and lie her next to the wall""

So he jumped off his milk-white steed, and he set the lady on
And all the way he walked on foot, and he held her by the hand
He held her by the middle of the waist, for fear that she could fall
Before they'd lie in one bed, and she'd lie next to the wall

""But,"" said the pretty lady, ""before you me perplex
""It's you must answer questions yet, and that is questions six
""It's questions six you must tell me, and that is three times twa
""Before I'll lie in your bed at either stock or wall""

""Oh what is greener than the grass? What is higher than the trees?
""Oh what is worse than woman's voice? What is deeper than the seas?
""What was the first bird that did crow? And what did first down fall?
""Before I'll lie in your bed at either stock or wall""

""Oh envy's greener than the grass, and is higher than the trees
""The devil is worse than woman's voice, hell is deeper than the seas.
""The cock is the first bird that did crow, and the dew did first down fall
""So we'll both lie in one bed, and you'll lie next to the wall""

Oh little did that lady think that morning when she rose
That this would be the very last of all her maiden days
And in the cottage where they lived, they're the happiest pair of all
And they both lie in one bed, and she lies next to the wall",Captain Wedderburn
Bellowhead,"Cold blows the wind of my true love
Cold blow the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Greenwood he lies slain

I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve months and a day

But when twelve months they were up and gone
This young man, he arose
What makes you sit by my grave and weep?
I can't take my repose

One kiss, one kiss from your lily-white lips
One kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss from your lily-white lips
Then return back to your grave

These lips, they are as cold as clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If you were to kiss these lily-white lips
Your life would not be long

Oh don't you remember the garden grove
Where once we used to walk
Go pick the finest flower of the morn
It will wither to a stalk

Go fetch me a flower from the dungeon deep
Bring water from a stone
Bring white milk from a virgin's breast
That baby never bore none

Go dig me a grave both wide and deep
Do it as quick as you may
That I may lay down and take a long sleep
For twelve months and a day",Cold Blows the Wind
Bellowhead,"As I walked down to New York town, a fair maid I did meet
She asked me back to see her place; she lived on Barrack Street

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And when we got to Barrack Street, we stopped at forty-four
Her mother and her sister were waiting at the door

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And when I got inside the house, the drinks were passed around
The liquor was so awful strong, my head went round and round
And then we had another drink before we sat to eat
The liquor was so awful strong, I quickly fell asleep

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

When I awoke next morning, I had an aching head
And there was I Jack all alone, stark naked in me bed
My gold watch and my money and my lady friend were gone
And there was I Jack all alone, stark naked in the room

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

Oh looking round that little room, there's nothing I could see
But a woman's shift and apron that were no use to me
With a barrel for a suit of clothes, down Cherry Street forlorn
Where Martin Churchill took me in and he sent me round Cape Horn

So sailor lads, take warning when you land on New York shore
You'll have to get up early to be smarter than a whore

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?",New York Girls

Bells Of,"Remember when there was nothing else to do, 
But lie and bed and, 
Wonder how it was always up to you, 
And no one else and,
Early mornings, made by warnings, 
What's the point of the alarm 
That I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, 
I'm not complaining, 
But waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head 
Its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone 
Ten times a day, 
Why get up 
When my morning doesn't even start till two
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

Remember when we would hang out every day, 
And we would rather,
Not be told what to do or what to say, 
Cause nothing mattered.
Never boring with slept in mornings, 
Not ashamed of bad habits that I'm forming.
Its not important if days are shortened, 
I can't make time when nothings new,
Cause waking up is hard to do so

Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up my morning doesn't even start till two?
Forget reality waking up is hard to do.

What's a day when it all ends up the same, 
And lasts forever?
Can't complain 
When there's nothing there to blame, 
And things can't be better.
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, 
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading.
No concentration on hesitation, 
I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone.
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone,
But when I see you hanging around with anyone,
It's not unusual to see me cry.
Oh, I wanna die.
It's not unusual to go out at anytime,
But when I see you out and about,
It's such a crime.
If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual.
It happens everyday,
No matter what you say,
You find it happens all the time.
Love will never do what you want it to.
Why can't this crazy love be mine?
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone.
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone,
But if I ever found that you'd change at anytime,
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you.

In my heart, I'm as hungry as ever

This is the room where we met
Where I live
There's a lady who walks everywhere on her hands
Doesn't trust where her feet want to take her
(Not in here)
This is the room where we met
(Not in here)
This is the dress I had on
This is not the moment you fear
When you wake up and no one is there

Low hangs the moon inside this room
So that I'm a witness when you Judas my heart
Judas my heart

Where I live
There's a blanket of sighs and it covers the stars
In my heart, I'm as hungry as ever

This is not the moment I fear
I say ""I"" 'stead of ""she"" now you're here

Low hangs the moon inside my room
So that I'm a witness when you Judas my heart
Judas my heart

Can I get a witness when you do this to my heart again?
Can I get a witness when you Judas my heart again?
Where I live there's a lady who walks everywhere on her hands just like me
Doesn't trust where her feet want to take her again
And her feet want to take her again
She loves me

We were golden
Then you walked away
In my garden
You were something, there

You walked to me
Buried in my garden
I see you there
Buried in my garden
I will catch you there

That once, in my garden
Broken my shell
That once in my garden
Be there in my garden
Be there in my garden

In my garden
We were golden
Then you walked away

You walked away

Bad bitches she got a team around her
I was the plug when she needed power
I show up and her leaning like the Pisa tower
Life's a bitch and you can't play in fate
Then she broke my heart and left a band-aid
I wish we fell in love with our eyes closed
Say the word and I'ma show up with the blindfolds
Flexin', you always flexin' fuck all your exes
You in the baller section tryna teach us all a lesson
So I don't bother calling you don't bother textin'
Ironically I think I get the message

Hey
I haven't heard from you in a while
I just want to say
I just pray that you stay safe

Come pull up and get your back blown
Close the door and put the latch on
Won't save her but she hit me on the bat phone

I see that look on your face
Come on

I think they feel the pressure {4X}
I know they feel the pressure {4X}
Nowww! 

[Verse 1: Belly]
Swear to gud I?m about to blow
I?m coming in y?all going out the door
You can hate you can doubt the flow
But tell the whole globe it?s about to snow
Broads, cars, record deals and cheddar
I ain?t involved if it ain?t a mil or better
You feel the pressure? I know you do
Roadsters, Rovers, I overdue
I do it how you suppose to do
Get rich before rap no loans recouped,
I?m what a cold a flow little promo do
Stones looking like a million little photo shoots
Maybe that?s why all the models stop
Same time the jaws and the pradas drop, 
They feel the pressure like bottle tops
Right before the bottle pop
Owww! 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2: Belly]
It?s Belly boy get the name right
I paint life you can ask what my game like
Get introduced in the daylight
Seduce and knock boots in the same night
Girls kill for a him, 
That?s me the new day filmore slim, 
I have you sweating till you feel more slim
You wanna feel less them and feel more him (I knowww)
I have to win that?s right whole life full of acronyms
DD on her chest, CP on my chest
AC on the seats, TV in the deck
SLR couple GTs and a S
DBD(death before dishonor) when I speak, 200 Gs on my neck
It?s be do you feel the pressure yet?
I?m MJ with three seconds left
Yesss! 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Ginuwine]
It?s pressure and I know you feel it
Got you freaking got you bouncing
Said we like it like that
Belly and Ginuwine and we just won?t stop
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)
Say ohho woaho ohh (ohho woaho ohh)
We got bottles popping
Females doing what they wanna do and they can?t stop screaming

Everybody 'round me saying I should relax
'Cause I been going hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I want to do is forget about my past
And smoke a little weed, really nothing too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smiling
Probably 'cause I'm faded, or I'm chilling with the fans
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back
But I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shooting movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfucking soundtrack
Then I play it back on the eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super-fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone when the shit's too strong

Came up out the north, we was playing with a different snow
Took my niggas from the four-one to Pacifico
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen, hoe, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her you don't gotta make it difficult
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippie bitches sending me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God, but her shoe's Christian
I heard she serving everybody like the soup kitchen
Getting hoes higher, getting hoes higher
She got work in the morning, I'm getting hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purple when you mix it pink
You know I fucking mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

Piped up

Too sick for an antitode
I'm a lion you an antelope
Big big ounces, cantelope
Married to the game and you can't elope
Too legend in my city with a few legends
New weapon, got me looking like I'm two stepping
Taking pictures with bottles you never paid for
Posing in front of cars but they ain't yours
But I still eat the pussy like a main course
Weed louder than a chainsaw
Exotic product, chronic, gin and tonic
Profit is the only topic
Popping out the cockpit bitch I'm popping
You stay on the rebound Dennis Rodman

I can't fuck if she ain't exotic
I can't smoke if it ain't exotic
If it ain't foreign I can't drive it

Talking birds, boy I had ‘em by the dinner plate
Got ‘em out of state, used to put ‘em on the interstate
Born to lose, made to win, even angels sin
And when it come to money, loyalty is paper thin

I hope you know Jesus if you cross me
My shit’s cerebral, no palsy, the soul haunts me
You can smell poor seeping out my pores
Sleeping on the floor with my feet against the door
Back was more than kind of sore
Cracked my spinal cord
Might’ve been from the pills, I guess that’s an either or
Dumb, I think numb ‘cause I know pain
I think love killed us like Cobain

So right around Christmas Eve she told me pack my shit and leave
Her name was Eve, kissed me gently on the adam’s apple
I cried for weeks on my knees at the tabernacle
Streets cold, monday, feet cold
Designer shoes, never said you got a cheap sole
Running through the darkness, fell into a deep hole
Come and see the freak show, not a single seat sold
If you only knew the hell that we was going through
Not to overdo it but I swear this shit is overdue
A voice told me the gods favor a chosen few
I hope your word like this pistol ‘cause I’ma hold you to it

And you're the only one who hears my voice
Apologies were spoken underneath the harvest trees
While our dreams fell down like autumn leaves

Its getting hard to pick myself up off the ground this time
And your willingness never seems to change my mind
And I'm falling into your arms again
I'm thinking that I should put my trust in him

Do you remember November twenty-second?
I could see your breath but your heart was vaguing
Maybe this is what I need, some uncertainty
But if I let it go, I could be risking everything

there's no day like today...

there's no day like today...

And your drifting far away...

And it's tearing me..and it's tearing me..

It's tearing me apart...

And I'm running into your arms again

The crying is faint
The same fate overtakes them
The sound rings in the midst

So I'll endure this 'til you take me away
Holding close to your hands never slipping through your grip
The road is getting longer and I don't know if I can make it
But I'll hold hoping to get stronger all the while
Calling out, let it pass
Let it drown with the water
Freedom from this place is found in you, it's found in you
I'll be home soon with the letter in my left hand
I'll be home soon cause I'm coming home to you
Chasing the wind
The light that you lead is only a shadow now
But it's bright enough for me to lead you out
So I'll take this until it fades
Until it falls
Until it breaks
And I'll kiss it goodbye
I'll kiss life goodbye

So I went back to the wild side of life

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

And now you've left the Rubicon you'll always be ahead

Dear Sally
I haven't given up on you yet,
But if the penny ever drops, I hope I run a mile.
Did you forget that they'd forgotten us?
Do I look surprised?
Who did you screw to become so see-through?
What did you cost?
You're an advert for it.

Does your boyfriend work for MTV?
Does he throw a fit and talk of me?
Social spastic.
Who did you screw to become so see-through?
What did you cost?
You're an advert for it.",Dear Sally
Ben Adams,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Ben Allison,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which 
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva.

Ben Bernie,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Ben Bernie,"There's a boy that's in our band
And how he blows that horn
Finest since you're born
When he starts you're gone
They all call him ""Hot Lips"" for
He blows real red-hot notes
And ev'rybody on the floor just floats
(That's what they say)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps like no one has
You're on your toes and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips

His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
 
Heard him play the other night
And old man Oscar Clive who is eighty five
Sure as you're alive
Got so frisky when he started out to do his stuff
Was told to sit right down for being rough
(And then he said)

Ben Bernie,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental Over You
Ben Bernie,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself,

Ben Besiakov,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Ben Besiakov,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
