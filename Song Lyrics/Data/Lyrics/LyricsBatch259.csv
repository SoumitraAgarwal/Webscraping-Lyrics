Lani Hall,"Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

Lani Hall,"Watching the sun
Watching it come
Watching it come up 
Over the rooftops

Cloudy and warm
Maybe a storm
You can never quite tell
From the morning

And it's going to be a day
There is really no way to say no
To the morning

Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to
Say but
Come on morning

Waiting for mail
Maybe a tail
From an old friend
Or even a lover

Sometimes there's none
But we have fun
Thinking of all
Who might have written

And maybe there are seasons
And maybe they change
And maybe to love 
Is not so strange

The sounds of the day
They hurry away
Now they are gone 
Until tomorrow

When day will break
And you will wake
And you will rake your hands
Across your eyes and realize

That it's going to be a day
There is really no way 
To say no to the morning

Yes it's going to be a day
There is really nothing left to say but
Come on morning
",To the Morning
Lani Hall,"Wish I was your child 
Hold me in your heart
We could love so free
And know it never goodbye
But I am not a child 
And wish for star frame
My love
No I never be afraid of who I am 
And who I am not come what may
Wish I was a bird 
I warmed you with my wings
Safe from all the storm
You know what true love can bring
But I am not a bird
And wishes and just fly away
My love
No I never be afraid of who I am
And who I am not come what may
La la la 
La la la
But I am not the voice 
Shinning in your eyes
That you understand
My love
No we never be afraid of who we are
And who were not come what may
No we never be afraid of who we are
And who were not come what may
No we never be afraid of who we are

Lani Hall,"You walk in a room,
A woman can feel the heat.
One look is a guarantee
Nights could be long and sweet.
The message is clear
Like nothing IÂ´ve ever known.
But the more that I hear,
Forget about long-range plans
Â´Cause this manÂ´s got his own.

To get mixed up with a man who says never
May be big trouble, but then
I just could be the woman to take you
And make you never say never again.

Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.
Never, never say never again.

YouÂ´ve got all the moves.
Ah, but baby IÂ´ve got them too.
No matter your attitude or your mood
IÂ´ll come through.
The touch of your voice.
The feel of your eyes on me.
You leave me no choice.
Though I know thereÂ´s danger there
I donÂ´t care, let it be.

To get it bad with a man who says never
May have no future, but then
I just could be the woman to reach you
And teach you to never say never again.

IÂ´ll beg you.
IÂ´ll get you.
IÂ´ll reach you.
IÂ´ll teach you.
IÂ´ll take you.
IÂ´ll make you.",Never Say Never Again
Lani Hall,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Lani Hall,"Grown accustomed to her looks
Oh I, I've grown, grown accustomed to her voice

I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night and noon

Her smiles, her frowns, her ups and her downs
Are second nature to me now
(Second nature)
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet

Grown accustomed to her looks

""Good morning"", every day

Her joys, her woes, her highs, her lows
Are second nature to me now
(Second nature)
Like breathing out and breathing in
(Breathing out and in)

I'm so grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to the trace of something in the air

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree

If you believed in me

Lani Hall,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Lani Hall,"The scene is dead by morning
Slipping past the great divide
It chases over bridges
Spins me out of my own mind

Hollow is how you like it
What you see is what you get
Say you love me again
But you never do (yeah)

I am not singing a love,
Singing a love song
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I want to fall away and
Waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

I see I disappoint you
Why don't you find another threat?
This isn't what you thought now
If you fall, won't you tell me in my ear?
You're here to waste their time dear
But you can't waste mine
Oh say you love me again
But you never do (yeah)

I am not singing a love,
Singing a love song
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
Oh I want to fall away and
Waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

But if you can't save love anyway,
You'll love again
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long
I want to fall away and
Waste another day
Cause love is a game to you now
Watch just to see how long

Lani Hall,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go

Lani Hall,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song
Lani Hall,"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word?

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore

Then, suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart

So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

I want things, I got dreams, I'm praying, still no means

So I just breath and then go back to sleep
In dreamland I'm famous, hope it happens one day and
Until one day begins I really hope that I can hold on

Lannie Garrett,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar

Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado

Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by,
Where do they go? oh I don't know, don't know;
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes,
Stories of love belong to you and to me.

Oh, dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh my dindi.
Oh dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing dindi, happy dindi, when you're with me.

I love you more each day, yes I do, yes I do;
I'd let you go away, if you take me with you.

Don't you know, dindi, I'd be running and searching for you like a river that
Can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.
Can't find the sea that would be me without you dindi.

Like a river that can't find the sea, that would be me without you, my dindi.

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

What's done in the dark will soon shine in the light
You're provin em right by suckin the pipe, stereotype
Media hype is killing me
Why must my brothers steal from me?
Woman is queen, she feeds what you need at birth
Research of self, develops your mental health
Man is king, lead the route

By selling poison to another
Poison for pay rotts the brain away
Caught in the devil's trap

Call it what you want, it doesn't matter what the name is
The effect is still the same

What's that?

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Hear the wrath of my vocab, straight from the rhyme lab
Scopin my gold rope but don't attempt to grab
Watch your step, keep a civilized head
The truth is said to awaken the brain-dead
Why intercept me from a positive destiny
Music, music, my important necessity
God bless me and those who test me
Help those that I'm down with and let the rest be
Stuck in a black hole and yes, I withhold
A key so you can see me in poetry motion
Steadily coastin to a lyrical plot that puts a knot in my pocket
Now let's bear witness to the sight of the no-good
Minds are molded, and flooded with falsehood
Too much TV, you're brainwashed by Hollywood
I speak truth, so let it be understood
You want peace, boy, you have to show some
Some cry for peace and still carry a gun
I understand, get or get got, shoot or get shot
That's not to way to go
Well, I'ma chill back and stay out of crack and stay low
And let the vibes flow

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
The set is not done yet, some have learned but I bet
Some will twist the truth and rebuke the positive groups
Who prophecize and open eyes of the blind
Use words like tide to clean dirt from your mind
Often I practice cause practice makes perfect
You disagree with that? Yo, I feel it's worth it
I can't hold back, yo, I must expose the fact
Truth is hidden, self-knowledge you lack
Let words slam, back-track, check the diagram
When Spanky flex he creates the side-effects
Set my course, proceed to speak with force
Grab the sourc and take lyrical intercourse
Secure my rhyme from suckers and rhyme grabbers
Watch your back, you never know who's a backstabber
You're now a slave, feel the force of my soundwave
As the vibes flow

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
As I hit my conclusion you find it amusin
How I drift to the rhymthm of the samples I'm usin
Status is proven by the fact that you're movin
Words flow rapidly, melody soothin
One never prospers from a negative thought
You might win in the begin, but lose in the end
Suckers being drugged into my lyrical pit
Brains are lit, they throw a fit but still they sit
Alone in my death dome scared of my voice tone
Step in my path, you're just entered war zone
Now how can you quiz me if you don't know the answer
The effect from my dialect is somewhat cancer
Slow death, you lose breath as I rip what's left
of your flesh and let God save the rest
So if you didn't know, now you know
To chill back when I go and let the vibes flow

It's like pumpin in my ear drums
Yeah, the vibe's pumpin in my ear drums
It's like pumpin in my ear drums
Yeah, the vibe's pumpin in my ear drums
It's like pumpin in my ear drums
Yeah, the vibe is pumpin in my ear drums
It's like pumpin in my ear drums
Yeah, the vibe is pumpin in my ear drums",Let the Vibes Flow
Laquan,"As regarding rhythm to the pulse in the sequence of the musical phrase
not in sequence of a metronome, kick your lyrical theory

[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
Mic-check, turn my microphone up
When I speak throat muscles tone up
Switch the pitch, find a style to stick with
And let my words flow like liquid
As I unfold and swing an episode
Notion in motion at a constant drift
I excel, rebel to fail, teach as well
Show and prove, show and tell
Many fade like a fad or phase
Yo, I'ma stand for days and decades
News ask: What's Laquan's task?
Fame and freedom and it's soon to come
The response is snaps and handclpas
Chuck perfect cuts, I project raps
I'm livin positive, those that are negative will fear me
As I present my theory

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Step in a full step, packin a full load
Rhythm is progress, the style is swing mode
It's like I transform when words are perfected
And you are infected and g's are collected
The slammin bass upholds the style I carry
Rhymes were written in ink and stationary
Face to face you're lookin in the mirror
I have a project, you can't consider it
Dance material pumpin through your stereo
The mic is loud so words will come clear to you
Place it on your tables, cut it, eat it
Yo, I'ma feed this cause many need this
Black lyrical episode
Let knowledge unfold, guide the lost souls
Down a new road to a better life
It seems you haven't been livin right
Well, let's put in effect a resurrection
Lead the lost ones in a new direction
Victory isn't given, it's taken
Trapped in my lyrical lake, no escapin
Non-stop words identified as a poem
You start to fear me
As I present my theory

So deep I'm livin inside the track
Yo Epic, bring the break back

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
Samples coast in a circular motion
Metaphors as smooth as lotion
Silence, you're on a journey, I'm the pilot
I have a train of lyrics, ride em
Follow my path as the concepts leads ya
Slavin with a cravin and I'ma feed ya
Knowledge I bring in a full swing rhythm
Manifest your best, the aim is towards success and bypass the criticism
Often I sit alone and wonder
Why would one keep another under?
It's the wicked one's process
To not let one progress his best
I project my vocals clearly
To express my theory

Third eye shines like a force of light
Tongue used as a tool to provide a Godly light
Most are lost and blinded by vanity
Africa's home and the birth of humanity
How could a nation grow without its roots
For the land is the tree and we're the fruit
Awareness of black pride is kept aside
It's time the mentally dead revise alive
Pyramids prove we were first in existence
Change our conditions and rise with persistence
Position is fightening, words are enlightening
For those who can't see the light of G-o-d
Black is a state of mind, it's more than a skin color
The skin color doesn't make you a true brother
It's been said, return of the dead will take place
For that time is now cause now is the be	 Turn

A false statement's never made my recital
Raise your vibrations and raise the vibrations of others
In God's sight we're all brothers
Pyramids to projects, subject to death
State of mind and your brother is all we have left
Grow into new growth or let your soul float
In the fire of a false desire
Mind is important, flesh is a vehicle
God is most powerful, man is a miracle
Under the prayer that was spoken by Moses
How do I know this? The Bible has told us
Watch the books you read cause some books deceive
An evil writer may attempt to mislead
The sand of my homeland is what created man
Seek knowledge and learn

God in the sky? That's all a big lie
Freedom is not free, so how can I be free?
Smoke screen clouds your eyes so you can't see
Babylon has fallen, our time has come
From the womb to the tomb as the young begin to bloom
Some pump their fist and pose to be down with this
Tackle the untruth, regroup and teach the youth
Man can kill as well as heal
As I wake the blind with words of steel

Become number one (cope)
Seek knowledge and learn (hope)

Dippin in the bowl, positions take place
Smile on my face shows a sign of great taste
Sound effects proceed to discharge
Drain my vein, my spoon is no longer large
So I rest, let it digest
Analyze again, then it opens up and let me in
So I cover up and take the lead
And when I'm done I pray I didn't plant a seed
Ooh, those cold feet
Headrush from the moment of heat
Dive in deep, the pace is set
The rest is rated x, but you know what happened next
Flesh connects, body parts sweat (why?)
I'm obsessed with puddin pie

Make my approach with a kiss on her throat
I'm whispering love notes and brother, I hope
That I can convince her cause I want to stick her
Thin and petite, I prefer to have her thicker
To say I can touch but not too much is frontin
She knows she wants the nut, so keep it comin
Non-cooperative puttin up a struggle
In less than five splash in the puddle
Skin to skin, both thighs I'm strokin
The door bell rings, our concentration is broken
It's a friend with a paralyzin shape
See-through laces, shoulda seen my face
Watery eyes, I almost cried, why?
I'm obsessed with the puddin pie

Puddin pie, my oh my
A splash and a clap as I commence to dive
I strive as I begin to drive
Thrive on thighs, thrust in overdrive
I gotta get in, the pressure is buildin up
You're kickin your feet up while my stroke is kept up
My spoon is flexed up, do not let up
Cause if you let up the s-e-x won't be kept up
You're sexually activated, mentally stimulated
The pie is penetrated, positions are situated
Bodies compressed
Emotions leave you undressed and now you're blessed
With a pleasure I descend
I done put in cause puddin's my friend
Smile on your face as your legs extend
I tried to ask why and tried to deny
But it's in my eyes, I'm obsessed with the puddin pie

..like chicken and it's finger lickin

[ VERSE 4: Craig Parker ]
Puddin pie, sweet and sensuous
Smooth and subtle, that's essential, wish
You could smell, I can tell it'll blow your mind
The type of pie to eat you gotta have time
In it you win it, but out it you want it
Whenever you got it I know you want to flaunt it
So give it here, no fear, give it a try
( ? ) this is the ultimate puddin pie

My tolerance is limited, so watch your mouth when you speak
Step up, you get swept up off your feet

And when it's empty I fall back and reload
Let it build up and let it explode
Dwell inside my pattern, brother, you're stranded
Handcuff the bandits, they're like scandalous

We're still in movement, so don't stop stoppin

A mellow swing is how I like to go when I flow

Because you're teethin for this and it's the season for this
Questions, questions, I'm hounded with questions
So I throw the answers at your direction
Draggin the suckers for not movin enough
You think I'm puffin a bluff, well keep pressin your luck
Real with this is how I deal with this
Straight as a drill with this, I show skill in this

Swing blue and sweat black a massive strain is on my brain
400 years of pain are flowing through my veins
The fight is for glory, the cause is mandatory
Stress, strife, the price you pay in life
Heads rattle between a skin battle
Purpose is worthless, hell met the surface
Earthly desires have kept you spiritually dead
Look beyond and your starving soul is fed
Some have strayed from Afrocentric ways
On a never ending quest for better days
Many sin, peace is made within
No time to spare, the clock continues to spin
I have a question, why test a 
Brother who can still feel the pain of his ancestors?
(Stand up) Pledge of allegiance, of what?
Burn the flag, system is unjust
Shocked, your mouth dropped, you wonder why I said that

Seeking survival in a world of wickedness
Whether so-called good or hypocrites
Gotta defend the home I descend
Frighten my color might cover when blend
Times are tough, can't give up, I'm livin in mud
Divine truth only comes through flesh and blood
Must survive in the jungle of concrete
The zone where the wicked enslave the meek
Enemies suffer, disciples prevail
We shall now be the head, no longer the tail

He was shot by cop the other night
He didn't pack a gun or knife
He didn't stop when the cops said ""freeze!"" and lost his life
Tears flood his mother's eyes, she wonders why
Skin is the reason her son died
Death is death, in any case it's still sin
Why must the system use death as discipline
When will this color war come to an end
And do the good still always win?

So we decided to invent a modified
Type that resembles no one

No procrastinating, we must hustle
On the strength we gotta use much muscle

You think it's a dream, but you're still a prisoner

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Lara Fabian,"Plus que tout
C'est comme ça que tu voulais l'aimer
Rien que nous
Tu lui disais pour la faire rêver
Après tout
Lui mentir ne t'as pas servis
Tu es là tout seul le cœur désuni
Pour toujours
Douceur, tendresse elle t'avait juré
Par amour
Elle s'était donnée
Sans détour
Elle voulait t'aimer
Ça te faisait peur
Ces overdoses de bonheur

Que tu réalises à ton tour
Que vivre sans elle, c'est l'enfer tous les jours
Libre tu te prends à tout détester
Même cette liberté
Tu te sens emprisonné

Que tu regrettes à n'en crever
C'est pire tu t'accuses d'avoir mal aimé
Dire que tout semblait parfait
Tu voudrais courir, la ratrapper

C'est l'heure de sonner l'hallali, la bête doit mourir ce matin
Je vais ouvrir grand les volets, crevez-moi le cœur, je suis prêt
Je veux m'endormir pour toujours

Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel, c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie, c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant que pour la garder, je l'ai tuée
Je ne suis qu'un fou, qu'un fou, un fou d'amour
Un pauvre fou qui meurt, qui meurt d'amour.",Requiem Pour un Fou

On the border line
And I search my heart
For a reason why
Did I love too much
Did I hold too tight
Can we leave it all behind

Ooh baby, can we give it one more try
I still want you by my side
Ooh baby, you're the best thing in my life
Can we give it one more try

You never took a chance
So if you have to go
I will understand
But can you hold me now
Think of what we had
Let me love you one more time

And all the things that I wanted to say

And me wondering if I'd ever be back

I didn't come here to lose
I didn't come here believing I would ever be
away from you
I didn't come here to find out

I was brought here by the power of love

And I remember the road just went on forever
Just couldn't seem to turn that car around
'Till in the distance like a long lost treasure
A phone booth that just could not be found
And you standing there at the doorway waiting
And the moment when we laid back down

I said I didn't come here to leave you
I didn't come here to lose
I didn't come here believing I would ever be
away from you
I didn't come here to find out
There's a weakness in my faith

And one we'll never forget
One we can leave behind

There was no other

You will be mine

And I see your face
Through every tear that I cry
With every breath and every sound
I can hear another voice and swear that you're around
And every word is clear
'Cause I know
The memory won't let go
Until you're mine
To love again

Who's to say what lives in the past
Who's to say that love won't last
Time's been standing still
Waiting so patiently until
Until that one day when
When I will have you
To love again

You are my life
And I pray for when
You will be mine

About what I am and what I want
I know I only want to be in love with you

You are my heart
How could I ever let you go
You are my soul
I had to lose my should to know
How much you mean
To me, you are my heart

There's the sun to light the day
My colors turned to gray
The day I saw you walk away
Now there's nothing left to say
But when I dream, I pray
That life could be like yesterday

You are my heart
How could I ever let you go
You are my soul
I had to lose my should to know
How much you mean
To me, you are my heart",You Are My Heart
Lara Fabian,"I don't know what is going on 
You turn around and touch my heart 
A silent moment speaks the truth 
Something has happened all at once 
It should have scared me in advance 
But I was falling in those eyes of yours 
And so
Fear was gone 
I knew there was nothing else I'd ever want 

I know you 
You're not from here 
I've waited for you to appear 
To take my breath way 
And make me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly

I can't get used to missing you 
If this is how it's gotta be 
I need an angel to watch over me 
No one can hold the hands of time 
But I can hold you in my mind 
Over and over like a melody 

For now 
I'll stand still 
For now 
I'll be filled by the memory of your skin 

I know you 
You're not from here 
You don't belong to lies and tears 
The greatness of your soul 
Makes me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours 
And I fly, and I fly, and I fly

I know you 
You're not from here 
I've waited for you to appear 
To take my breath way 
And make me weep 
You're not from here 
Not from this here and now 
Just a touch of yours

Lara Fabian,"Wandering like a leaf upon the wind
I have been searching for someone
Holding out for a love to shake my soul
Heaven or nothing
Then you walked into my life
In a blaze of light
I've never wanted someone more
You are the one I've waited for

Light of my life
You are the fire in my heart
When I am lost
I know I'll feel you burning in the dark
You're the light of my life
Every star in the sky
Shines more brightly when you're at my side
You're the light of my life

Dreaming, I feel you next to me
No, I'm not, I'm not dreaming
Cause I'm drowning in your kiss
I die in your arms
And when I hear you call my name
Baby, it's like I'm born again

[Chorus]
Your love's a lantern in the rain
Bringing me home time and again
Burning like an eternal flame

Light of my life
You're the beat of my heart
When I am lost
When you're lost I know
You'll see me shining
Shining in the dark
You're the light of my life
Like the stars in the sky
Only you can take me through
You're the only one who makes it right
Only you set fire to the night
You're the light of my life",Light of My Life [*]

After these years of despair
And nothing untouched
With the deepest side of my pain
Although I can't say
There's nothing there
Not even a dream to share

Are you familiar?
Or should I show you around?
It's a cold room
With nothing inside
Not a sound
But to be amazed What stillness can do
It will bring you back to you

Silence (Silence)
Is the moment between everyone
Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive
Silence 
Now that you've seen it
You don't need to go back at all
And when you feel that
Cold room inside
Stand tall
You will embrace it
As you recall
It made you stronger after all

Silence (Silence) Is the moment between everyone
Is the best friend you have in the world
That moment in time
Will help you to survive
Silence 
Silence
Let your consciousness finally be heard
It's unconscious
But you'll hear the burst
The voice inside will bring you back to life

It's the moment in time

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

After these years in this pain
My heart has finally chosen
To beat a bit faster again
Now that I feel the awakening
I don't look back anymore
I am mysteriously standing
On the good side of my soul

All I recall is a moment
Sadness is fading away
It is for passion I've fallen
But now, I'm back on my feet again
I wouldn't rewrite the story
Not even what seemed insane
How could I ever feel sorry
For being stronger than I am

I've cried enough
Over this priceless time I've lost
I've learned the going gets too tough
When you regret love
I've cried enough
What you'll see on my face again
Is nothing but the rain
I've cried enough

Why would I try to deny it
Most of my dreams are a mess
But what didn't kill me in fact has taught me
Life's a big game of chess
Though I believe in the future
I keep in mind all the past
Now that I live in the present
I don't care about the rest

The feeling of dancing with this pain

I toss and turn and then
I roll on your side of the bed

And I wish I could go where you went
I'll fall asleep until I see you
At the other end.

How can I love so hard with only half a heart?
Where do I go from here?
How do I breathe in here?

I am intoxicated by
You...

I try to store away
Pictures and little souvenirs
I found a tone to say I'll be okay
Look, I'm still here

Lying is my way
To keep these feet walking around
While my soul instead
Has found a way to reach your ground

And everyone around me is waiting for this girl to fall
But my heart isn't missing I've just lost control
If I don't know why, why would I know how? 

I've been working with the devils trying to exercise
Feelings I've been hiding down in the darker side
There wasn't any trading, never sold my soul
I'm simply moving on
Going, gone

Think I'm losing my fight
To make sense of it all
Got to build on my life
So I'm safe from the fall
I'm subjected, expected to know what I feel
But I don't feel nothing
It's alright, no big deal

How can I expect anybody to understand
I've been sadly mistreating all of my own demands
Now all I need is freedom, not this ego-land
I want to do no wrong I'm simply moving on
I'm going, going, gone

And after all I know, there's nothing left to say
And if it's all my fault I'll take it all

Where did you go? And did you think of me?

It's hard to breath when my heart is sinking
I'm slipping fast as I'm reaching for you
It's gonna hurt 'cause I have been there before
Can't take much more, can't take another night
Without you here beside me

I want to review my kisses on every inch of your body
I want to reveal my secrets that only you should know
I feel all this pain inside me that only your lips can make better
I wanna review my kisses so you won't forget that you are mine

Don't wanna care more than you do
Don't wanna be the one who's out in the rain
Don't wanna get that call where you sound so cold
So far away, so far away like the distant roll of thunder

I want to reveal my secrets that only you should know
I feel all this pain inside me that only your lips can make better
I wanna review my kisses so you won't forget that you are mine

Elle n'avait jamais quitté son île encore
La Sicile était son rivage
Et la famille, son paysage

Où l'on ne se perd qu'en se lâchant la main
Bien que les nuits aient été plus froides
Que leurs chaleureuses engueulades
Ce qui les unit éloignait leur chagrin

Oh God
May the light of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa can you find me in the night?
Papa are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?

Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone

Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book 1've ever read

Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright

Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you

Where is it written
What is it I was meant to be?
That I can't dare
It all began the day I found
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky
I stepped outside and looked around
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall
I felt the most
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
If you've never flown at all
Though it's safer to stay on the ground
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found
No matter where I go
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My every sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know
Each step I take 
(Papa, I've a voice now!)
Each page I turn 
(Papa, I've a choice now!)
Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
Just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you
Papa, I can see you
Papa, I can feel you
Papa, watch me fly!",A Piece of Sky

When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Lay me down, it's been a long day
Time to unwind, time to relax
Let the tension flow away

Hollow jets in my fingers and my toes
Too tired to masturbate
No sound in the dark as I float in outer space

Peewee golf balls roll by my face
Golf tees hammered through my feet and my hands
Nailed as an example again

Tied down with fishing line
Lilliputian sacrifice
Fireworks go off, I hear the cheers
Smell the hot dogs
Smell the mustard and the beer

Sharp needles pierce my flesh
Hypodermics press down and inject
20 gallons of Canfield's diet Fudge Soda
Effervescent bubbling chocolate blood

Micron by micron my flesh starts to melt

Hot beams on the cool wet sand
Bury me with the help of the wind and the waves

Submerged in the cool soil
Earthworms crawl in and crawl out
Further down is the underground aquifer cave
The bats and blind fish
Are all my friends

Soil hardens and it starts to crack
The lake is dry as desert air
Sidewinders crawl through my eye sockets
Their soft white underbelly feels like love

Blowing tumbleweeds stick to my ribs
Night falls, the sky is red
Captain Beefheart flies up on gargoyle wings
Talons reach down to take me back again

Make my life one big prank

All that we are when we're on a stage
Is Vaudeville jester for a day
As an old proverb says
""If every fool wore a crown, we should all be king""

My license to make fun of everyone
Comes from knowing the biggest joke of all
Read a headline the other day
""Clown dies from a pie in the face""

Can't be on stage all the time
The public image could swallow my life
Living up to your own myth's no fun
Drives our best talents nuts

Think we'd be Stepford children
If they could do away
With the music we love the most

Lyrics warp your children's minds
Just a minute now, that's our job!
Your worst enemy's your own kids
Don't talk with them, buy our lies instead

Don't wanna hear Lee Atwater sing the blues
Got a right to sing my way too
Gagging those who tell it like it is
Won't make the problems go way

C'mon get the skeletons out of the closet
We're all clowns in one form or another
If we weren't hung up minding people's private lives
We might not be so afraid of ourselves

Who are you to legislate what's best
Never heard my music or read all the words
Is it my heart they want to ban?

So and to you I say God bless seein' your face
Lets me see my own so why zone

And think about the days we got stolen
In the staircases of parkin' buildings livin' children's
Rollin' in the world so cold just like pelgrims
In my great dilly nowadays perilli

Get to see one and other and when we connect
We still brothers and now we in the cooperative world
And the game is different you get caught up in the twirl
If your fam ain't effective so here's our perspective
To help each other 'cause man ain't it hectic

And you can't say love is true until it's tried

It looked like we were sure to fail the test

Every hurtful word we ever said in spite
To tear our world apart, I did my best
It almost broke my heart to take the test

Every hurtful word we ever said in spite

Then on the right I wrote the reasons why
I should stay with you until I die

Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I want to be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade

This ain't no stumbling block

I'm gonna climb right up on top

How hard it is to recognize

Every time a door slams shut
I know a window's gonna open up
Just as long as I believe

(Billy Maddox - Paul Thorn - Lari White)


Love, righteous and real

A dream I could touch

A trust I could feel

I had it all and I threw it away

With some stupid move I wish I could take back today

Was I lost was I blind that I couldn?t see

What losin' you would do to me.


I must?ve been high

To let you walk away, to let you say goodbye

I must?ve been high

How could I let you go, darlIn?, I?ll never know

I must?ve been high

Stoned out of my mind.


Time has opened my eyes

These empty arms have made my heart wise

I?ll never find a better lover and friend

I?m ashamed to admit what a fool I?ve been

And I know I?ve got no right to be

Begging you to come back to me

I can only plead insanity

Have mercy, baby, mercy.


I must?ve been high

To let you walk away, to let you say goodbye

I must?ve been high

How could I let you go, darlin', I?ll never know

I must?ve been high

Stoned out of my mind...

In our old familiar place
An empty spot beside Him,
Where once I used to wait 
To be filled with strength and wisdom
For the battles of the day
I would have passed Him by again 
If I didn't hear Him say

(chorus)

I miss my time with you 
Those moments together
I need to be with you each day
And it hurts Me when you say
You're too busy,
Busy trying to serve Me
But how can you serve Me 
When your spirits empty
There's a longing in My heart
Wanting more than just a part of you
It's true, I miss My time with you


What will I have to offer
How can I truly care
My efforts have no meaning
When Your presence isn't there
But You'll provide the power
If I take time to pray
I'll stay right here beside You
And You'll never have to say.

That the world was a perfect place
Every street was filled with peace and love
But then I woke and rubbed my eyes
Thinking no trace of the night was left
But all day long I’ve been saying to myself

If you want a world that’s more loving
Then you’ve got to love somebody
You want to be in world that’s more caring
Then reach out and help somebody
You’ll make the world a better place
Beginning with you

And if I say it loud enough
Maybe somebody else will hear
That love is still the greatest of all gifts
And if we give ourselves in love
The world will see a brighter place
'Cause it keeps time with every step we take

If you want a world that’s more loving
Then you’ve got to love somebody
You want to be in a world that’s more caring
Then reach out and help somebody
You’ll make the world a better place
Before you are through
To live in a world with more sharing
You’ll just have to do more giving
If you want the earth filled with joyful noise
Then open your heart and start singing
Make this world a better place
Beginning with you

The world is you and the world is me
And it will be what we make it
Let’s fill it up with so much love 
There won’t be room enough to take it

Then you’ve got to love somebody
You want to be in a world that’s more caring

Larnelle Harris,"Brought up in the church against your will
Forced to sit through sermons and be still
Making trouble for the Sunday School teacher
Running through the pews
Just a child then
You were wide-eyed and confused
Screaming on the bus with all the youth
More concerned with dating than with truth
Too cool to join the choir, too smart to go to school
Church was boring
And the scriptures, just more rules

[Chorus:]
But all through the years
Your eyes and ears
Saw just enough of Christ among the people here
To know that you could trust
To know that you were loved
Until there came the day
Your heart could finally say (pray)
I want to go where You are going, Lord
I want to be among Your people where You are
I cannot live my life alone
I don't know how
But You would not bring me this far to leave me now

Finally off to college for the fall
Fifty different lifestyles down one hall
Your professors question everything
Your roommates test your faith
And easy answers seem so out of place

Running from the chapel with your spouse
And making monthly payments on the house
You were living for your children
And they up and moved away
Your friends seem older
And worry fills your days

Life carried me along
In my soul I yearned to follow God

I looked hard at this world
To learn how heaven could be gained
Just to end where I began
Where human effort is all in vain

[Chorus]
Were it not for grace
I can tell you where Id be
Wandering down some pointless road to nowhere
With my salvation up to me
I know how that would go
The battles I would face
Forever running but losing this race
Were it not for grace

So here is all my praise
Expressed with all my heart
Offered to the Friend who took my place
And ran a course I could not start
And when He saw in full
Just how much His would cost
He still went the final mile between me and heaven
So I would not be lost

When God’s voice spoke from a burning bush

And every saint that’s gone before us
Will be there when we come home

Larry Adler,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Larry Bluth,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's

Until I'm almost mad

I guess I'll go through life

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

Like after the rain, when the wind breezes a sigh

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

They're standin' and sittin' and layin' in line

First they'll do a little singin', then hear a little preachin'
And get saved for the 3rd time this week
A bowl of soup later and a pat on the shoulder
And by midnight, they're back on the street

They walk to the corner of 4th street and Broadway
Then take the first alley on the right
One of them asks a stranger, ""How 'bout a hand""?
And he gives 'em one finger at a time

Then they spot an old buddy with a bottle of heaven
Then pass around what means everything
One bottle for four, thank God, someone scored

La garra del tigre nunca mide rangos

At least that's what the people said
But Eldridge, he was only working out
All the things they put inside his head.
He was like an angry lion, trapped in a vice
They couldn't keep him down,
And so they put his soul on ice.

They locked him in a prison cell
But he managed to get away.
But living on the run ain't no fun,
Both eyes open every night and day.
Just a little peace and quiet
Was his one desire,
But it never came 'til something set his soul on fire.

Then the man in the moon spoke in his ear
With a word that was true and a voice that was clear,
Go back to your people, but lean on me,
They can lock you up again, but I have set you free.

Some people, they don't agree.

But you never wrote back
And you never made me feel any better

Always sitting here
Fretting and getting confused
Halfway desperate
For a headline of hope in the news
When the telephone rang
I spilled it all over my sweather

The call was for me
And I answered the phone in the kitchen
But the room was too hot
I forgot I was cooking my chicken

I was burning like hell
But the stove wasn't on
Then the voice on the line
Says the chicken is gone
The reciever goes dead and it
Hums while the plot starts to thicken

Would I have hung up the phone had I known
The whole room would start swaying
I was instantly cold
And I knew why my life wasn't paying
I had money and fame
But my wealth wasn't wise
What good are the coins on a dead man's eyesv and the
Ringing of chimes in my head
Said it's time to start praying

And laying up treasures in heavenv I was home and the

He thought he heard a burning scrub-brush say
Gotta free your people
From the pharoah's hand
Gotta take em all to the promised land

Moses knew that god was taking to him
So he set off to egypt with a vigor and vim
And moses bugged the pharoah - he bugged him
And he bugged him
Till he got his people free

He used real bugs

Yes indeed
He got his people freed

Stuck out a stick and one two three
The water rolled back and the people walked down
Everybody knew they wouldn't drown

And here comes the chariots clickety clack
Why moses took his stick
And he closed up the water
And the gyptians all took a bath

They all gave thanks
And they all praised the lord
Even though it took time he kept his word
He grab their foot and he took their hand

Larry Norman,"I was born and raised an orphan in a land that once was free
In a land that poured its love out on the moon;
And I grew up in the shadows of your silos filled with grain,
But you never helped to fill my empty spoon.

And when I was ten you murdered law with courtroom politics,
And you learned to make a lie sound just like truth;
But I know you better now and I don't fall for all your tricks,
And you've lost the one advantage of my youth.

You kill a black man at midnight just for talking to your daughter,
Then you make his wife your mistress and you leave her without water;
And the sheet you wear upon your face is the sheet your children sleep on,
At every meal you say a prayer; you don't believe but still you keep on.

And your money says in God we trust,
But it's against the law to pray in school;
You say we beat the Russians to the moon,
And I say you starved your children to do it.

You are far across the ocean but the war is not your own,
And while you're winning theirs, you're gonna lose the one at home;
Do you really think the only way to bring about the peace
Is to sacrifice your children and kill all your enemies?

The politicians all make speeches while the news men all take note,
And they exaggerate the issues as they shove them down our throats;
Is it really up to them whether this country sinks or floats?
Well I wonder who would lead us if none of us would vote.

Well my phone is tapped and my lips are chapped from whispering through the fence,
You know every move I make, or is that just coincidence?
Well you try to make my way of life a little less like jail,
If I promise to make tapes and slides and send them through the mail.

And your money says in God we trust,
But it's against the law to pray in school;
You say we beat the Russians to the moon,
And I say you starved your children to do it.
You say all men are equal, all men are brothers,
Then why are the rich more equal than others?

That a man leaves his darkness when he follows the Son",The Great American Novel

One disappears and ones left standing still

Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show,

And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so

That I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, no, now

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

There's that anguish, there's that doubt

About what's been and what awaits me

I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands

As I wonder how the old folks are back home

Larry Sparks,"1. Here I labor and toil as I look for a home,
Just a humble abode among men,
While in Heaven a mansion is waiting for me
And a gentle voice pleading ""come in"".
CHORUS:

There's a mansion now empty, just waiting for me
At the end of life's troublesome way.
Many friends and dear loved ones will welcome me there
Near the door of that mansion some day.

2. Ever thankful am I that my Savior and Lord
Promised unto the weary sweet rest;
Nothing more could I ask than a mansion above,
There to live with the saved and the blest.

CHORUS:

3. When my labor and toiling have ended below
And my hands shall lie folded in rest,
I'll exchange this old home for a mansion up there
And invite the arch angel as guest.

Larry Sparks,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

He'd had enough dyin', all the grief that he could take
From the Appamattox Courthouse, where the deed was sadly done
There was no place left for him to go but home

Ch) He walked all the way home to Southampton County
To carry all he owned and try to forget
Wearing sadness like a mantle for the friends he lost in vain
He walked all the way home to start his life again

For years to come the fallen would sleep beneath the cross
What he held in angry silence time could never burn away

As they talked a while, his blue eyes seemed to ease her broken heart

I wondered there to take my chances, Twenty some odd years ago.

I?ll not forget first time I saw her, A vivid picture in my dreams.
A southern bell in soft white cotton, clinging to her like a breeze.
(CHORUS)

Nothing?s sweet as Georgia peaches, when you pick them for yourself.
Wait too long there?re out of season, They?ll be gone to someone else.

She ask me Boy where do you come from? Are you only passing through?
I?d like to know what brings you down here, I made her smile when I said YOU.

A stolen moment too quickly faded, as she pulled away her hand.
She said I?m sorry it?s been taken, promised to another man.

Takes me back to my favorite memory, Of the Georgia girl I left behind.

I met this guy a while back, looked like Shania Twain. Only a little shorter, and, uh, faces were different. I was drunk, it looked like Shania Twain. Next morning Mark Twain is laying there next to me there, he--ho, ho--she was ugly, now. I take her to Glamour Shops, get her an estimate, you know. She was--man, she was ugly right there. She had marks on her from where people had been touching her with the ten-foot poles! 

I don't like Miami too much though, there's a lot of drugs and stuff. I was down there in broad daylight, car drive by, says, ""You want some cocaine?""

I'm like, ""No, officer.""

I don't do drugs. I don't know what I'm doing. I tried smoking mushrooms once, couldn't keep the pizza lit, you know, so I quit doing that. I tell you, I was madder than a three-legged dog trying to bury a turd on an icy lake, I tell you what. 

Has it ever happened to you when you make love to your girlfriend and the dog licks your hind-end?
Now that--Lord, I apologize, for talking about the dog licking my crack there, and be with the starving pygmies down there in New Guinea. Amen.

I'm trying to teach my dog safe sex but he keeps licking off the rubbers. That's funny! I don't care who you are, that's funny right there! If you don't think that's funny, you get out of here right now, 'cause. That's a good program right there. Preacher told me that joke. That's right.

I don't like them. 
If I had a dollar for every fake boob I tongue-kissed last week, I'd have--well, I wouldn't have any money or nothing, I'm just saying. 
I don't like the fake boobs, you know? 
I went out with this one girl, had one of them beauty marks like Cindy Crawford. 
Now that's sexy right there, now.

I tell you, I was more frustrated than a legless Ethiopian watching a doughnut roll down a hill, I tell you what, I was--

Larry the Cable Guy,"This is the story of the first Thanksgiving, once again by my drunk grandpa:

Many years ago...Christopher Columbus and his pilgrim buddies come to America on a boat called the Mayflower to live because the English King wouldn't let the Jewish people go.
So Moses, who was a friend of Christopher Columbus, rented 3 boats: the Mayflower, the Santa Maria, and the USS Enterprise.
When they landed on America, and indian squaw, named Sacagawea, met them and traded them pelts for beer, and then showed them how to de-gut a rabbit.
That night her friends danced around with their boobs hanging out and balanced clay pots on their heads.
The head pilgrim then baptized all the Indians to be Christians and they shot turkeys and played horseshoes. 
It was General Custer's birthday, and three Oriental Kings showed up with gifts of myrrh and other crap.
Many pilgrims did not survive the first winter because they didn't have heat because Jimmy Carter who was president of the Pilgrims had an oil embargo.

Sacagawea and her Indian friends burnt buffalo turds and heated the camp.
The pilgrims was thankful.
However it smelled so bad animals come outta the forest two by two.
The Lord then made a rainbow appear, to show that he would never make turds burn again, and cause a horrible smell.
Sacagawea fell in love with Kemosabe, and they were married on that first Thanksgiving, and lived in a tent with wheels. That's right.
All the pilgrims were glad to be away from the king, and to beat that they all landed right on Thanksgiving day.
Charlton Heston was then elected president.

Larry Vuckovich,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue
Larry Vuckovich,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true,

My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Larry Vuckovich,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Oh what hard luck stories thay all hand me.

When you have gone

I will be remembering

Larry Weaver,"Every year I pack the car and head for Myrtle Beach
Where else can one have so much culture within ones reach?
I love to see those girls with big hair cruising down the strand
And see those rednecks get redder instead of getting tan.

But Myrtle Beach is not my favorite part of the trip
I first must make a little stop before I get to it
So lets hop into my Nova and head for that state line
And when I see that big sombrero Ill know everything is fine.

Take me to South of the Border I think you know the way
Just follow those clever billboards along the interstate
Take me to South of the Border I love those neon signs
Chili Today, Hot Tamale man, that one gets me every time.

Well check into Pedros Motel and leave our troubles at the door
Then its off to Pedros Fireworks -- well stock up for July 4
Then over to Pedros Martial Arts to get some gifts for the kids
I think they'll like some throwing stars, num chucks and a big bullwhip.

Then its down to Pedros T-shirts where Ill have the time of my life.
Lets get grandma that funny hat that reads Old Farts Wife
And lets get dad some underwear that will scream Hey, I'm high class
The ones with the inscription Worlds Largest Source of Natural Gas.

Take me to South of the Border down where Pedro lives 
I need to buy some Chia pets they make such great gifts
Take me to South of the Border just below that state line
When I see that big sombrero, Ill know everything is fine.

OK. I want everyone listening out there to sing the chorus with me.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

I know you're not trying to impress me.
In line from a distance,
Too scared at all to ask your name.
All alone on a hot summer night,
I still regret to this day,
That I never got your name.

Do you wanna dance with me?
Do you wanna dance, little rude girl?
Do you wanna dance with me?
Do you wanna dance, little rude girl?

Waiting so patient.
Waiting, waiting for an invitation,
What an excursion.
Told my friends a different version.

That I never got your name.

My name is Lars
I'm from Cambell california
You might know that by now
I'm of danish decent
For that I'm proud
See my father was a nomad
I haven't seen him for awhile
Lost a brother
Still got a mother I ain't motherless
For some of you out there
I know that might be hard to believe
See I've been up and I've been down
I've smiled and I've frowned
I've made a every gesture
That a young man can steal
And I know that I'm married to the sea
Well I know I'm married to the sea
You see some people are locked down man
And some are free
But I know that I'm married to the sea

Well I've been rich I've been poor
Spend it all on whores
Got married and divorce to the girl that's next door
Stolen fast cars dated pop stars
Been around the world
Slept with underage women
Turned tricks for a thrill
Tried sucide but didn't die
Well I'm here to tell
I don't know a heaven
But I've made peace with hell
Been shot at been stabbed
Been beatin up real bad
Survived everything without being killed

and I know I'm married to the sea
And I know I'm married to the sea
Some people are locked down
Some are free
And I know I'm married to the sea

slept in fancy hotels eaten from garbage cans
Down every highway I grew into a man
See my best friend die right before my eyes
Aborted a baby and shed on my tears
Been strung out on pills slammed my share of dope yea
I drank all your booze man and I snorted your coke
I've been loved I've been hated
To me its all the same
Embraced by a lover your cursing my name

and I know I'm married to the sea
And I know I'm married to the sea
Some people are locked down man
And some are free
And I know I'm married to the sea

and I know I'm married to the sea
And I know I'm married to the sea
Some people are locked down sugar
And some are free
And I know I'm married to the sea

I'm married to the sea
You see the great big ocean
Well that's for me
Sorry ladies I'm married to the sea
I'm married to the sea
I'm married to the sea

Lars Gullin,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way
Lars Gullin,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

It's gotta be sunny to me

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Lars Gullin,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

Tu m'as dit ""bye bye"", va-t-en, ne te retourne pas

J'te souhaite un molosse riche, un chien d'la casse
Vu qu'la beauté ne dure qu'un temps, lui il pourra t'refaire la face

Maybe it's I who has changed
The feelings I'd had rearranged
A space that's between us becoming a hole
As I'm growing older

[Chorus]
It's almost faded
Passions jaded
Passions jaded
By my heart

Something's changing between
You and me
A bond that's melting so
Painlessly
A weight has been lifted from
You and I
Maybe it's better this way
I can't help but feeling okay
This sweetly is forming and molding my soul
As I'm growing older

[Chorus]

If this is true
God set us free
Perhaps you and I are not meant to be
And if in the end
We drift apart
I want you to know God used you right from the start

Maybe it's better this way
I can't help but feeling okay
This sweetly is forming and molding my soul
As I'm growing older

LaRue,"If I could look back on me what would I see? I'd see this as
A dream coming to a place that's Been our heart and soul 
See the pieces in our life Falling faster into time And in the 
End I want to say Chorus no goodbyes Just smile

Don't cry To embrace Life live in this time I don't know how
Long or far we'll go But I know that You have called us

Regrets And to be the first who says Chorus",No Goodbyes
LaRue,"Even though I'm firmly planted on the ground
I still run and even though I face these mountains I still soar
To the sun I need you here
To show me how to feel
Cause I'm tired of living for myself 

When this theory of flight
This question of life that goes on
And I struggle and try to
Be the light of your love I fall 
Into the sea of waves crashing
Over me and you wash me clean 
From the sin I have been seen

So many reasons why I would lose sight 
But feel fine yea but feel fine
I lift my hands to the sky I lift my hands up to the sky
Even though I am firmly planted on the ground 
I still run and even though I face
These mountain I still soar to the sun and I'm crying
And I'm praying and I'm holding onto you 'cause this life that you
Gave me I will give it back to you 
I raise my hands into the sky",Theory of Flight
LaRue,"Wake up another day it's funny how you put yourself in cruise control
You say you say your life is very plain
Waiting fo a spark to light the coal inside
And that is when you feel alive
But that's just where it starts
Are you too comfortable in the dark?

[Chorus]
You threw it all away
You had so much to gain you threw it all away
Now there's nothing left to claim
And now you're lost inside of you
What am I supposed to do generation lost
All for everything until it comes to the cross
A fear of faith becomes their cage
They're getting used to 
Feeling weightless
Breathing fakeness
Dreaming faithless

To talk to you
Feeling weightless
Breathing fakeness
Dreaming faithless

Las Ardillitas de Lalo Guerrero,"El camino que lleva a Belén
Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió
Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey,
Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón
Al Redentor, al Redentor

Yo quisiera poner a tu pies
Algún presente que te agrade Señor,
Más tú ya sabes que soy pobre también,
Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor
(rom pom pom pom, rom pom pom pom)
En tu honor frente al portal tocaré
Con mi tambor 

El camino que lleva a Belén
Voy marcando con mi viejo tambor,
Nada hay mejor que yo pueda ofrecer,
Su ronco acento es un canto de amor
Al Redentor, al Redentor",El Ni単o del Tambor

Si quizás te vuelvo a ver me extremezco.
Pues se bien que aunque pasaron los años
Eres tu mi mas bonito recuerdo

Me han contado que volviste a mi pueblo,
Que caminas solitario why callado
Why que solo vives de los recuerdos
De este amor que te dejo ilusionado.

Tu tambien fuiste mi primer amor,
Tu tambien fuiste la primera ilusion
Que entro a mi vida.
Vuelve mi amor que yo te quiero besar.
Vuelve a mi vida yo prometo
Adorarte mi dulzura!!!

Yo te voy a querer,
Te voy a adorar,
Lo juro por Dios

Porque tu eres mi sol
Eres mi pasion

why Vuelve!!! Estrellas Andinas!!! (Spoken)

Este amor llego a turbar Mi inocencia.
Al llenar el corazon de caricias.
Mi primer amor que cosa mas bella,
Tu primer amor que historia tan linda

En mi mente vive aquel primer beso,
De Deseo, de corazon sin palabras.
Como olvidar ese instante tan bello,
Cuando la hora del amor nos llegaba

En aquel tiempo tu me hicistes feliz
Por esto quiero que me vuelvas a amar
Mi amor divino...

Solo al saber que estas tan cerca de mí,
Quiero gritarte mi amor vuelveme a amar
Why te prometo.

Yo te voy a querer,
Te voy a adorar,
To juro por Dios

Porque tu eres mi sol
Eres mi pasion
Te quiero mi amor

Yo te voy a querer,
Te voy a adorar,

Las Guitarras del Renacimiento,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence
Las Hermanas Huertas,"La negra noche tendió su manto 
Surgió la niebla, murió la luz 
Y en las tinieblas de mi alma triste 
Como una sombra llegaste tú

Ven, ilumina la árida senda 
Por donde vaga loca ilusión 
Dame tan solo una esperanza 
Que fortifique mi corazón 

Como en la noche nace el rocío 
Y en los jardines nace la flor 
Así en mi alma, niña adorada

Pero otro mundo esperaba allá
Yo arrimé, siempre disparo a mansalva
Pero esa piel fue particular
La hacés bien, y aunque te hierva la sangre
Te encadenas para no llamar
¿Cómo hacés? Conozco todos tus trucos
Pero aún así me das que pensar
Te guardas el orgullo donde nadie
Pueda dudar de que lo tenés
Y así vas, sin perder el objetivo
Pidiendo dos cuando querés tres
Ya estoy bien, ya me ordené en mi desorden
Y aquellas voces no me hablan más
Por favor, mentime y dame la espalda
Otra vez no quiero patinar
Y me esperás, más de la cuenta
Siendo siempre la que yo soñe
Y firme yo, me encierro en que es peor

¿Qué esperás? Mostrame todas las cartas
A cara de perro no sé jugar
Me endulzás, el ego siendo sincera
Dale un poco y te va a pedir más
Lo sabés, no hay arma más seductra
Que contestar siempre la verdad
Siempre estás, del otro lado del muro
De los lamentos que me contás
No sé hablar, sin decir malas palabras
Amantes, mentira, infidelidad
Nunca más, te vendo gato por liebre
Por no ser cruel, pierdo honestidad
No es el fin, el problema son los medios
No es algo que pueda respetar
No está mal, que termine en las historias

Y siempre serás la que yo soñé
Y yo seguiré pensando que es peor

Que te encanta tenerlo

Y hoy estoy canabico corazón
Que no le encuentro el pelo
Al huevo que tengo
Delante de mi vista

Quien te dijo que nadie llegaba
Después de estos dos
Que golpearon la puerta y no saben
A que fiesta vinieron

Ves que es bola y no gira
No sirve pa' nada
Porque esta atascada
Mi amor

No todo orgasmo acaba bien amor
No todo lo que brilla es oro
No quedo ni el loro
En esta habitación
Que nunca alquilamos

Nos equivocamos de subte
Y terminamos en cualquier lado
Destino taimado
Y siempre le hacemos caso

Tanto beso suicidándose por ahí
En el rincón de esta boca
Que no lo sepulta
Pero sabe de tierra

Insisto si no gira no es bola
O es bola atascada
Y no sirve pa' nada

Out of the blue

Faster than the speed of light

Still I care for you
Love can be tough 
Cannot deny it

The things I should say
Know that my heart 
Is in the right place

Do you still feel the way I do?
Do you still feel the way I do?
I have to know
Can you forgive me?
I know that we can make it right
If you still feel the way I do

Can't rewind
The times I've hurt you
I was so wrong
I learned it the hard way

I may not know 
The things I should do 
Know that my heart
Is in the right place

What you mean to me

What I've done and where I have to be

Schedule is so unreal
And it changes how I feel
Developing an attitude
So right now I'm altering my mood

Have some coco, read a book
With no though of how I look
Gotta spend some time with me exclusively
Turn my CD player on and just play my favorite song
I deserve the chance to take a break

Here's my chance to just take my time
Just relax and try to unwind
Something's stressing me everyday
Gotta get away

Play some music, unplug the phone
Chill fo' real 'cause I'm in my zone
Everything will be okay, gotta get away
Get away

Maybe I can take a drive
Have no where to arrive
Visit somethin' from my past
Have a blast and be happy I'm alive

Take a minute just to dream
Have a scoop of ice cream
Just relax and take a day, get away

Here's my chance to just take my time
Just relax and try to unwind

Last Tuesday,"This van, our van is getting way too small
I can't find a good place in here to fall
Help me, help you, answer the call
Stay true to why we started it all

This is the part of me I wish you could not see
This is the hardest part of life on the big screen
I'm not, we're not who you want us to be
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop looking at me

Tonight I wish I was alone, highway 76
I'd feel better about myself not watching over you
This is the life I choose, don't let me off on an excuse
You follow me, I'll follow you

I can't believe, can't believe how long it?s been
Since we sold everything and left our friends
Do you know, do you know
I would never change anything?

For all the promises we didn't keep
For all the finish lines we didn't reach
Somehow, someway I know we'll make it
Become what we believe

Tonight I wish I was alone, highway 76
I'd feel better about myself not watching over you
This is the life I choose

Who's to say it's not the end
Our final record, final breath
With one last day is that all you would say?

I'm so afraid of living
When I'm unaware and unprepared
There's so much left to say

But when we stand before the Son of Man
Will we hang our heads, will He understand?
When it's all been said and done, was our race well run?

Tonight I wish I was with you
Tonight I'm headed home
Ready for another day, to become what I believe
This is the life I choose

Late Night Alumni,"Summer had seen enough of me.
A fall down and building up stone by stone.
Spring unleashed a swarm of birds and bees.
I did nothing to stop it. I'd come undone.

Everything you hear, it's nothing like the way it feels.
The flavor in the air, it's nothing next to being safe here.
I'm all of me all ears, if ears were stars to catch your tears.
Yet everything I hear flies like butterflies right through my ears.

I wake up, still feels like a dream.
I lie down, get up again and I'm still stunned.
Alive, unleashed; it proves too much for me.
There's no way I can stop it. It's too much fun.

Late Night Alumni,"It's half-hearted and complicating the way they've
Imparted,
Now isn't the best of all our days.

But we've started and now it's too late to say,
This uncharted place is too precarious to stay.
I'm unknown so, so I keep my head low.

It's beneath me, with all my ducks in a row.
If they ask me, I'll tell them I didn't know.
If they ask,
Say eventually we'll reap what they have sown.
It's a clash,
It's rash, we're caged,
Up-staged.

When they switch-back,

we say it's too fast, we rage,
Anxiously engaged.

We just take it,
Like we take it off the top.

And full-cirlce,
We're there before we'd ever really thought.

They just fake it,
Nobody asks them to stop.

Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight

Have a shower, then drive around
Looking out for Northfields Avenue

This is how I feel baby

She was the kind of girl that I wanted
She was like my homie, my best friend
If there was one girl perfect in this world
It would have to be her
She was the kind of girl that I needed
She was off the chain and I mean it
I swear that she was too good to be true
But she love the ground I walk on
In her eyes, I could do no wrong to her
But somewhere along the lines, started feelin' myself
And I got all into her
But then one day I went too far, and didn't check myself
And I ended up losin her
But now I'm all by myself, and I can't help myself

Is he treatin' her right
Is he keepin' her satisfied
Who's touchin her now
Is he givin her something she can feel
Oh, I want to know

Who's givin her what I wasn't giving

Now I always said real niggas don't trip
So I hopped in my whip, and jumped on the strip
'cause I knew if I really needed someone
The girls are lining up
I pick three and I go home
But know matter how many I love
I can't help but wonder if
My girl's alone, can somebody tell me

Said that she was doing fine, everything is alright

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

This is where I long to be

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo

They went so fast

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Don't ask me to say my name 
Don't ask me to share my fame 
It's all about the flashlights, it's all about the flames 

You took the bait and now you're looking like a fool 
Don't ask how we do it so cool 
Don't ask us to break the rules 
It's all about the bassline, it's all about the clues 

It's all about the hairline and it's all about the game 
Don't ask me to say my name 

Don't ask me to share my fame

It's all about the flashlights, it's all about the flames 

You took the bait and now you're looking like a fool 

Don't ask how we do it so cool 

Don't ask us to break the rules 
It's all about the bassline, it's all about the clues",Intro
