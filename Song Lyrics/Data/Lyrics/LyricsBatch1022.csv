Method Man,"Yo M. C.'s out there, you betta stand clear
It's Funk Doc M. E.th on da world premiere
From New Jerz straight talk, america's best
Co' Island Staten Island is where I'm at
Y'all amateurs act like hoes offendin us
We're special eders go on tours on banana bus
D. O. Same m. O., drive through bricks
Chicken shotty, that ass make me lie to my bitch
Word to god doc throw more lines then fishin rod
No stars, we're supergod non recouperb-alls (yo)
Buttons is pressed to remove the press
Press a bullshit, my index press a full clip (YO)
Set up cones when I'm firing chrome
I hittin ladies to old men in retirement homes
Dail 9-1-1 runnin gun in the street dungeon
Earth, moon and stars checkin out what the sun done
Suspects change clothes
Before I leave the heat, I put two in rain grove for my range rove
Hot to death, cops is vex
I push a buck 60 if they try to block the lex
Drive by on the baja
Snatch the cartier watch I
Boucnce laughing off like clue ""HAHA""
Doc is like poppy, supplying you grand
So breaka breaka while I turn it to the Shoalin Man

Foreva underground
Nigga duck the mic when we come around
Control hammer like the mighty Thor
Bringin thunda down
Now you're in store for predator
Like refugees I come to settle score
Half-baked medifore, that taste even better raw
Hardcore holy war
Hits from the reservoir, southpaw saboteur
Land sharks get they chin checked when I jabba jaw
Time to walk my labrodor
Livin out my dreams, at the same time shatter yours
Code red fill 'em full of lead
Grateful dead live from Hemstead
Tiger Kunk Fu know the ledge
Check the full fledged knucklehead
Clam bread, livin on the edge used to be the best
Jack Frost sniffin at your nose, get your Suddafed
Rap Cheech and Chong, me and Red official budda head
Off track like ODB, I'm too black
I'm like Zoro, I mark a Wu, sign your back, motherfucka

(It ain't even a question) This side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) That side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) In the middle niggas too hardcore
So what cha, what cha, what cha, want (What cha want?)

(It ain't even a question) Def Squad niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) Wu Tang niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) Def Jam niggas too hardcore
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up) So what cha, what cha, what cha, want? 

Yo stomp wit the big dogs
Sick dog lurkin (Roof Roof)
Doc bradshaw, behind ball plant and steel curtains
Denver Bronco fan, glock squirtin
Brick city, stering wheel hurtin
Prepare y'all fast car for lane mergin
Hasta manana, why'all crash like that Yanna cock block into gramma
Got cock in Atlanta, rockin PPP Bandanas
While we fuck 'em on camera
It's too late to plant bait for my click to fall
We dodge boobie-traps and pitfalls and thick fog
When I tee, LA ride, ""It's y'alls""
Website couldnn't find a site wit Macintosh
On John Walsh
America's Most, aim for spots to put more in a terrier coat

Uh huh, we speak for the unheard
Caught in the matrix
Sound from the subbasement, ""Spread the word""
Like uncureables from dirty bird, beyond basic
John Wu these fake niggaz, give 'em replacements
The thrilla from Park Hilla
Bubonic plague any MC that swear he illa
Inject the dufus wit the lupus
Yukmouth rhymes that leave him toothless
My filled fly and filled groupless
Observe the record, livin out my name Repid
Study man and all his methods
And through his ethic, learn to expect the unexpected
One step ahead I, return like Jedi
Three hours behind your punk ass, catchin a red eye
First class but cooler than coach, murder he wrote
On the wall of the bathroom stalls shittin these quotes
""Fuck you all""
Scaredy cat kid, duckin these dogs
You don't like us, then we don't like y'all, lick the balls! 
Be easy, speak easy
This one be off the heazyy
Like my pubic hair, black and greazy

(It ain't even a question) This side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) That side niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) In the middle niggas too hardcore
So what cha, what cha, what cha, want (What cha want?)

(It ain't even a question) Def Squad niggas too hardcore
(It ain't even a question) Wu Tang niggas too hardcore

From the 5 star general
Attack you from the blind side, invisible
To the naked eye
Where them criminals
Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
The wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical
Condition in your physical for injurin
The officer and gentleman who stack by the benjamen

Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up care where heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like ""I'm hit""!!!
I'm just playin, I clear the croud out

Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club

Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my jeans is tough like Buddy Lee

New jacks studderin, that the man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb I hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite servallence
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or i put two more in that terriyaki chicken

You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back
Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
what's my name Meth he's name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain

Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And brauds got the nerve to act funny
You a champaine ho, with cool aide money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick
You back down a point on NFL blitz
I'm lyin buddah break fool and take two

Method Man,"Bitch!
Brick city, yo
Yo, yo funk doc straight lunatic since young
I ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics, my maintenance
I battle you and then me and meth exchange shifts
For money, to your house arrest anklet
I take it all, if not, here's a thousand
Bricks, be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
I'm constant, on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1-8
Doc serve til you lickin' the plate
Battle royal, in the ring smoking like doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then I hide with the waltons
Down south, the forty-four feela
I'm a dolo nigga, you a polo nigga
I'm an uptown shopper, you a soho nigga
Westside highway running, homo nigga

I'm the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
I empty niggas out like cristal bottles, uh
When I battle, I'm breaking bentleys down to gravel
I got the heat right here, we ain't got to travel
I'm bigger than producers, I figured out you losers
I knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game, come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal king james
Phantom menace, that's why niggas make faces like they drinking guinness
When they realize I'm not finished
I've been paid, I've been platinum, been spittin', uh
Been eatin', been ballin' and you know I'm shittin'
Platinum links, chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin' rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks, ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
That's why ya niggas freeze when I step up in the building
The godfather's here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine, the world all mine
Can't believe these cats is poppin' shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect, black gotti shot a tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats ain't live, look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time, I'll let you decide
The alize swigger, I clock twelve figgas
Think giuliani's rough I got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated, niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my mission's completed
Get loose, get loose, method man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose?
(blaze one) blaze one (blaze one) blaze one
Blaze, blaze, blaze one

Now four corners, four seasons
Four mc's with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there, suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
Mc's abusing my bitch, using my shit
I'm hanging off the roof with one hand, losing my grip
Now y'all don't wanna see me do that, now do you?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap, do you?
I do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where you'll find my buried treasure
I'm still wild, still tical
Still gritty style, foul, crimi-niminal, individual
Sing a song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on john gotti's dick
Now this is something that we don't rehearse
Put that rap shit second, and hip-hop first

Easy, ain't nann niggas spitting like me
Nor murderers motherfuckin' inc
Niggas will pass me, look me in the face, ask me
Are y'all really holdin' weight or did somebody gas me?
Ja be the myth, reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil' man made me give him a lift
So you ridin' with gangstas
I'm up to a whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique, niggas can't deal with
Try it (hataz) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than a little bit, hot shit
L.l. an red
Ja rule with hot nix I'm the best at that shit
So bitches explain this
We ride dick so well, head game from hell
I love making them yell, my name
Rule baby, and ain't shit gon' change, uh, uh",4 Seasons

Potent it get a girl pregnant off a finger ah

(We can die) Yeah I'm taking full blame
I'm hard headed, cap fitted for ryhmes
I touch up your shape up when Doc spit on the iron
What it is my brother?
(Trying to live my brother)
How you live my brother?

Bone shattering, beat battering men
Scattering like roaches
Bless 'em with the over dosage of black flag

Yo dog it's my fault, Doc shock with volts
Until deaf mutes can talk, cripple kids can walk
My style will show guns what it is to spark
It'll clear the park twenty miles apart
Doc is like bad weather reports by Al Rourke
If you're not from the tri-boro, story settled
I pack gaudy metal for those who act fool
Big fish in the water and we hard to harpoon
I'm like open wounds pour the iodide in
Messing with us is like Saving Private Ryan
You acting out of line now you lying, dying
Wash my evil hands in the fire hydrant
Yeah girl, my kahuna's hooked up in the harness
Flying through hard knock life and still touring
My ropes pop in Chicago I hit the floor then
Got up and woke up with a bird in the morning

Ayo we mo' phat than down south trash, and you know that
With format to blow the welcome of your door mat
Toes tap now to hellafied sound
Wipe your town off the road map, baby mess around
I propose that you go and get your crew
And get the bozack too, Def squad Wu
Are just slaves to the rhythm
Clinton is the Pres I still voted for Shirley Chisholm
Poisonous venom, my philosophy get busy-ism
The most beautiful, I get up in 'em
Menace as usual, play your corner
Slinging the ghetto pharmaceuticals, the Methadonna
OD on Flinstone chewables and mary mary mary
So dont ever say I didn't warn ya
And I dont wanna be the one to sik the dogs on ya
I'm still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my peoples ghetto
Pants are saggy, teeth yellow
Now thats what I call grimy, a million crazy kids behind me
Killa Hills 10304 is where you'll find me
If you're looking baby I'm right here

Ya'll got love for me? I got love for you and yours
Tical Part 0, my friend, rappers is fightin'
Like Tyson, when nothin' else work I'll start bitin'
My shit, and his shit, I'm hopin' it end

I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again

Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle
Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto:
""Ya'll might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow""

Ya'll tryin' to get me started
Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded?
Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist
Jump off a skyscraper, the roof who hit the hardest
Where the bastards at and where they habitats?
I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap
I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces
That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me
Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead
Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head
Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like 'Face
Mighty Healthy, you know I'm the shit, soon as you smelt me

For what it's worth, the early bird sit at the table and eat first
My niggaz need work, mami buggin', rippin' my t-shirt
We can kick it until our feet hurt
Mothers warn your daughters 'bout this tall drink of water
Spoiler, waiter give her anything she order on the menu
Method Man, live at your venue
Smokin' it, jumpin' off the dick, like he mental
Kid, I got a murder rap, and my head is simple
Open up the pussy, put the lead in the pencils
And people sayin' Wu gon' break up, ya'll
We got y'all numbers, it's time ya'll got your wake up calls, and..

The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it
Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin'

Senses and feelings distorted, they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
To complete the mission they had no decision in
No longer do they use our light and dark used to create
The vision in our towns but now, they red and blue override our brown skin

We've been conditioned to let off them rounds
When we see another color rag or hear another brother brag
About what set he claimin', poverty, drugs and poor
Education should be the target but we won't stay gamin' that

We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame
In that like there's fame in that, we hang out them car windows
And bust them slugs in the name of genocide in disguise
So we don't take blame for that but if there's honor amongst
You thieves in life then what the fuck you hidin' for?
Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin' for",Ridin' for Outro

Despacito",Method Man/Tical 0: The Prequel/LP3 (Intro)
Method Man,"""Yeah, that's right everybody get some act right""

Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for Elaine
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like

""Damn right everybody get some act right""

Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then y'all can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggaz like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene

""That's right everybody get some act right""

[Chorus:]
Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggaz (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
""That's right everybody get some act right""

Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggaz got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
And this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like

""Damn right everybody get some act right""

I get tips from BIG and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now your stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky

""That's right everybody get some act right""

[Chorus]

Extra extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it

""Damn right everybody get some act right""

Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
""There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could""
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef? Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like

""That's right everybody get some act right""

[Chorus]

""Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right
If it ain't well, it ain't right
If it ain't Meth, it ain't tight
So on that note like this, everybody get some act right""",Act Right
Method Man,"Uh that's right, oh yeah

Every time I say, yes, baby, you say no
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Scream at your frog, all's fair, love & basketball

Heard that she could suck a ball through a plastic straw
Come on, now, baby, come on-on

Come on, now, baby, come on-on

[Chorus]

If you girl come knockin' at my door, it's my duty
To give her what she came here for
I'm try'nna knock it down, but I ain't try'nna claim that dough
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's what's up, start the fire, Buddha, light things up

Pick a flavor, I'll come and scoop your whole team up
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
That's how it be, don't trip, but girl you put a hurtin' on me
Oh shit, hope other chicks don't take it personally
But ma, you killin' her, murder in the first degree
Come on, now, baby, come on-on
Okay, okay, can the ladies come out and play with Mr. Meth

Beware, danger, shoot off your flares
Warn all your dogs (tell 'em we here)

Never that, y'all don't come out til the coast is clear
(Who you suppose to fear) Street, I fears no one
You all thumbs, I probably murder you with your gun
When I start lettin' off (niggaz is jettin' off)
You straight chicken broth, we holes in your terrycloth

Double O, 3, long time no see
Who mind parts seas, and cause blind to see
Some think this industry is just all rhyme and G
Then he make it to the door, and he can't find the key
Don't know what it be, to make y'all follow my lead
Or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed
If rap wasn't rap no more, what would it be
I don't know, I'd be zonin' sometime, must be the weed...
That's that shit

This is it, (I'm stuck with ya'll) and ya'll stuck with me
In the lap of luxury, where the hell's cut for free
And the kid (can't fuck with ya'll) Til I got a tree
On some new property, at my new pot to pee, have mercy

For rappers that can use help
Now that Meth is back, you can tell me how my shoes felt
Just like Shaq in them size 22's
Except my games not a game
And I don't play by any rules man
Its time to build without a hardhat and goggles
Even with a map I'm still a hard head to follow
I thought you knew we do this everyday ok
And I think marijuana is just nature's way of saying hi
Only hydro buds, I get it crunk
It's alright if that bitch don't smoke then get her drunk
Now I pop a lot of shit, cause I can back it up (what)
I got that fire, bitch, its hard to pass it up (what)

Before I put the paint, I put the work in
And each person I catch slipping gunna need nursing
Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around at all
Take it from the most stepped on, your wearing open toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up
My crew stick bitches like you, for acting stuck up

Come on! Self service

Y'all know me since '93, now let that weed burn
Back in this bitch, class dismissed, it's the return
Of the super sperm, game over, lose a turn
Takes a germ to kill a germ, when will y'all killas learn
Your only as good as your last hit
Soon as you put them automatics on safety that's it
I calm them bastards, I call them ratchets
Till you blasted, till y'all come ashes to ashes

You either up or down, don't get that ass kicked

Ya'll niggaz fuck around, y'all only tough around
The crowds, scared to bust a round, don't get that ass kicked
What part of the game is this?
I came to break bread, evidently y'all killas came to bitch, nigga
So, whose the whipped nigga, don't even trip, nigga
Some say they pull trigga, I think they bullshitter
I just begun to fight, if mommy like daddy talk
Then daddy might get him some tonight
Give me, my limelight, give me, my five mics
Give me, some weed and a light to get my mind right

Is he, the illest M.C., to ever play the tough city
To find out it'll cost you bout a buck fifty
Across your face swiftly, my after taste shitty
Whose built by New Yitty, whose milked like two titties
And I ain't even got to say my name
I got this duck wit her legs up like, ""say my name, trick""
You think it's all a game, like pussy all the same
I'm speakin' toilet slang, not seakin' hall of fame
It's raw, sushi, stain in your drawers, dooky
Quarter a Lucy, quarter more for a groupie

That like to pop snoopy, think she gon' pop coochie
Just 'cause you got Gucci, don't mean you not hoochie
Girl, I tell it like a T-I-N
Ain't no other kids eatin' till I feed my kids
Trick, oh, you ain't crushin', sister, I can't do nothin' wit you
My money's celebate, honey, and we ain't fuckin' wit you
I do it for the nookie, some say I'm too pushy
Only thing better than pussy, that's some new pussy
There that go, looky, it's gettin' ugly even

And we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart
Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggaz hearts
I'm intellectual, plus professional
And Walbaums to vegetables
Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear
Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggaz
Blew shotties in niggaz lobbies, the grand RZA
We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke
Allah Math', show me when the needle broke
Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up
Never knew what they had, now they proud of us
Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission
Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me
Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew
Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little
Wrap up the whole rap government

Go head, ya'll floss wit it
Walk wit, I slap your boss wit it
Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted
Two puffs and off wit it
You smell the herb, 'fore I lit the spots its forfeit it
Blocks is hot, feel the shot from fourth/fifth it
With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reachin'
Respect when a grown man is speakin'
Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on ""creepin""
The five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'

Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house
Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til the cops come, suppose
I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday
Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free cd's, I'm like ""see these"" nuts

By any means necessary, it's on
B****, your f***ing with a dog, all I want to do is bury some bones
Take a piss on a tree and I'm gone, girlfriend don't get it wrong
I hate to be the one to s*** on your lawn, but I ain't got my dog license

I ain't nothing nice, and I ain't never met a piece of p**** I ain't liking
Sugar and spicing, kicked up with ice and, you can do anything with these hoes
Except housewife them, like snoop said ""it ain't nothing but a G thing""
Got a b**** in my bed, in nothing but a g-string, so peep game

Who the lucky female to taste these, snips and snails and puppy dog tails huh?
You're messing with me, I'm messing with you, I'm a dog trick
I chase cats like Peppy La Pu, dead on s***
My life's like a Holiday Inn, if my girl act up
I'm gonna f*** her friend, if I'm a what...

I'm a dog motherf***er, I walk on all fours
Find where you live at, s*** on your porch, Redman is hungry
Don't leave the food out, I'm pumped like a Pamela Anderson boob job
Straight up bulldog, mixed with a Shinshuu cause I bulls***, party a little bit

Swim with the shark, you're bound to drown
my weed is like green, and yours
Brown, the doctor the dog, from Cali to Georgia
when cats meow with noting on top they halter

I don't have Yemen that laugh when I laugh
we some dogs, we can kiss our own a**
Like a golden retriever, retrieving the chronic
the dose nose b****, and no need to hide it

Redman a flirt, always get my nuts stuck to the porch
like the dog on Joe Dirt

[Chorus: x 2]

Fish don't fry in the kitchen, b**** don't climb, keep b****ing
Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5
with the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission
Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O

to the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some VO (VO)
And mix it with some pena colidino
then slip it on the b**** then I dip with all her see-notes
Scandalous, yep b**** cause we know

every pretty hoe always down to pull a d-low
On me? No, so there won't be no shaking me down
breaking me down, here we go
You know I'm just oh so slick

the way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick
And I can tell, that you a freak
I want to stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet
Don't you know why?

And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet (sss...Oh)
Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot
I leave you and your crew to collide with me
Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle

How I break 'em like a bad habit, hit tracks like it's target practice
Then let these darts take a stab at it
Niggaz ain't got it, ain't never had it

Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night
I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light
Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type
If ya'll don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife
When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules

If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggas beep at

Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with

Give me a queen that respects a ""king"", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
'cause broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggas get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a man child
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game

No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-ooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oh

Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
'cause she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love

Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway
Ah, you and me together, baby

And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back)
I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz
What it is, what it is, wu-tang is for the kids
So niggas please, why y'all puffin' them trees
I'm damaging m.c.'s, oxygen, they can't breathe, fall

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out (hold on)

Then split a honey Dutch, roll it up, can't roll with us
If you can't hold your liquor, throw it up, y'all know what up
See we them niggas, ain't no ho in us, the flow is nuts
I'm off the meter, momma wished that I was off the reefer
But, for now, I got this game up in the cobra clutch
Plus, the silverback gorilla swigger, shot of Tequila to the gut
Nigga, trust, I got that Killa up
What y'all ain't feelin' us? Ain't feelin' ya
When half ya niggas posing similar, yea
Ladies and gents, I think this game need a enema, yea
It's ""common sense"", I Used 2 Love H.E.R., now they pimpin' her, yeah
But if you Enter the Wu-Tang, you tripping
Like somebody tied together your shoestring, now listen
I'm the, real deal, come on, come back to get ya like bad karma
Y'all niggas is throwing rocks with glass armor
Fuck the court system, pleading the fifth
And if Def Jam is deaf, start reading my lips
I'm cocky, possibly I got my reasons and shit
They ain't built a man that can stop me from feeding my kids

And if you don't know where I'm coming from, never know where I been
Most likely, where ya start at will be the place where you end

Until these rap niggaz stepped up, checked up, man this game is messed up
Next up, you know what it is, don't get it f'd up

And I don't mean to beat you in the head, but (head, but)
When you spit that, forget that, I eat these niggaz food
And the shit wrapped, where Cliff at? Tell 'em Mr. Meth got his shit back
The gift back, sign, sealed, delivered and gift wrapped
And when you hear that click-click (click-click)
That's real talk, some niggaz will talk to the cops
Get killed off, man how did you get caught with all the rocks
And still walk, no matter what you mix with a pig
You still pork, and money is still forced (still forced)
Yeah, that was right on cue, new and improved

There go the apple of my eye, my black butterfly
Don't try to pass me by, like you do them other guys
You do with brother's lies, about they baby mothers & they wives
And how you need they ass to survive
I ain't a bit surprised, and I ain't try'nna give you bad vibes
You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat, boo, now hold for a sec.
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose
Before you play the game, know the rules
Cause still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some ice cubes, playing with ya boobs, knawmean

Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G, like they do it in the hood, and
You give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real, then let's ride

Hey, pretty ma, you look sweat, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to eat
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle and beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy, to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, primadonna, oh my god, mommy, work it
Make a nigga wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her badunk
Double XL, she the ""Eye Candy of the Month""
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big club or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga
To scratch it, and bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it

Let's ride, I start up on your right
Peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love
Yes, I will, yes, I will

Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks
Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone to pick
Now, who that nigga in the zone and shit
Back in the building like he own the bitch, nobody cold as this
If I ain't got it, then it don't exist
I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come
Protect Ya Neck, when you dealing with them
Now Erick stick a fork in him, he done, hah
It boggles the mind, like try'nna 'ketchup' to a bottle of Heinz
It's like forensics try'nna follow the crime, they want time
And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes
While eighty five percent swallowing swine, see
Wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whatever he hone
Long as I got myself a Marilyn loan, phillies are better chrome
If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known
And while I sleep, my bitch be checkin' my phone, cause I'm a problem, nigga

Scream at ya frog, nigga leap up (now who got a problem with that?)
They need to beast up, nigga, speak up or

Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga
Like Billy Danze, I be running with ""Fame""
Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life
Hard body, another day in the life
Credit his momma now for raising him right, just want the people to know
I'm bout to blow, like I'm shaking the dice
Making me mad? Nah, y'all making me right, cause y'all was taking me light
So let my pen talk and say what he like
And have the court system say and indict, I'm O.J. on the mic
Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe
And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight
Not only raising on the price, on M.C.'ing, but I'm raising the bar
And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car
Motherfuckers I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonnaise jars
Purple haze, Cuban laid cigars, I'm a problem, nigga

E, you know I'm just like that
Big baller nigga, just like Shaq, so come on, niggaz
If they bust, I better bust right back
Meth spit it from the gut, like *gunshot* man down
I'm that dude, hands down, stare down
I'm past due, for Cash Rule, y'all can't clown
I'm bank now, your ass lose, nothing but rhyme

Method Man,"Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man

They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

I'm focused, got nothing but cock for cock-roaches, bitch, I'm gone before you noticed
Ducking these coppers, try'nna make the coldest

From all these stations and record labels, they killing culture, tell 'em niggaz

Man, I got Meth and on the day that I don't, I'll let you know, nigga
Nah, no carbon copies, they ain't got me, but they can watch me
Jewels jingling, middle finger at paparazzi
Not too cocky, but still, ain't too many niggaz can top me
So bounce you foes and pull ya shoes up, nigga ""Walk on""

Don't even blink, think fast, make the right move
Got a gun on ya, like Pinky had on Ice Cube
I don't play, homey, I got my stripes, too

Recognize, like Sam Sneed'll ""back down""
You sick and tired of wack niggaz, then act now
I show you how it's done, nigga, Gilla House
Give you a whole clip, turn your ruby glitter out, nigga ""Walk on""

And beat ya feet up, I'm sick with these dice, so put ya g's up
Then back a lighter tree, about to get the energy up
I milk like double D cup, plus, I air it out just like a sneaker
Will win, and then ""key"" your car like Alicia
Yup, my Meth is off the meter, more Yankee caps than Derek Jeter
Try'nna catch me a diva, then I'mma catch and meet ya
Might spill a thong, but still a don, still got
Love, for my baby moms, we just don't get along, hold the fuck on ""Walk on""

Allow me to reintroduce, nah, I don't need it
If you ain't got it since '92, nigga, beat it
Hop in the four of ya seven, black two-seater
Pull out a hammer, big as a vacuum cleaner

Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up

Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive and still the sun'll come out tomorrow

Shine, shine, shine and grind, 'cause it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bulls***, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya n***** know what's on my mind

When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up

By the K-1, Emergency Broadcasting System
In the, in the event of an actual emergency
You will be told to fall out

S.I. rockin' it, N.Y. rockin' it
S*** we stay poppin' it, 4-5 rockin' it
Game stay on top of it, lame, just the opposite
It's no thang, when I ""bring the pain"" ain't no stopping it

Who the f*** is this? About to bring the ruckus
This just ya boy, I'm some on other s***, my n****, take a puff of this
Piff man, I'm loving this, is Staten Island up in this?
B****, like we running it, and somebody wanna public

Turn it up a bit, so my thugs can thug a bit

L***** please, where y'all puffin' them trees?
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, you can't breathe, fall

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out
Hold on, man, what's really going on
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles and running
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out
Hold on, man, what's really going on
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles and running
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that

Here we go again, h***-smoke, blowing in the wind
Cops chasing, wanna throw him in the pen
And the day he leave the game, yo, he going in the Benz
On them 24's looking like he rolling on the rims

All daying, know what I'm sayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin'
While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar
Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying
'Cause tonight's the night, and me and my n****z ain't playing

y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical
Alotta n****z mad 'cause I ain't fold like they figure now
Let me put my fitted down, spit around
Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now

Here I got that miracle, sickest individual
Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do
It's not an act, it's all actual fact
The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out
Hold on, man, what's really going on
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles and running
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out
Hold on, man, what's really going on
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles and running
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that

Aww s***, ain't this about a b****
Give a f*** about a b****, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a n**** got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar s***

What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it?
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it

I'm deadin' ya kids and burn another blizz
What it is, what it is, Wu-Tang is for the kids?
So n****z please, why y'all puffin' them trees
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, they can't breathe, fall

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out
Hold on, man, what's really going on
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles and running
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out

Plus keep the glock in my basket
I cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can 'Wax on! Wax off!' like Daniel-son

Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in

Jump, move, crash, drink
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?

Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggaz be like ""Ahh he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah
It's nine-six so get with it
Peep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin
Listen, must we forget, I originated
all that wild shit, that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit
Brick City!! Is where I get down kid
Peace to all my buddah smokers on Prince
Fuck what ya heard, Brick City runs shit

PPP got the glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
Say what? Got some fly shit on deck
Say WHAT? Got some fly shit on deck
PPP got the glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck

First of all, MC's be on my balls, straight up
Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C. and Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz
Back, nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo everysince the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why them hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G... word up... hah hah...

If you see a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon do
Pick it up, pick it up
If you see a bitch passed on out the fuckin ground
What the fuck you gon do
Pick her up, pick her up
I keep it fly y'all
Fly fly y'all (5X)

Aiyyo, don't ride the dick of these real MC's
We pull Joints like Spike and blow crews to degrees
Then we buy G's with a half a pound of dope MC's
We bag for cheese just to get weed
Smoke indoneez I'm milky like Magnese
Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
at courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' big than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggaz be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents
To any, MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy, it's simply Ginger and Remi
It don't stop, Def Squad crew is hot

Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black tech nine
by the waistline, kickin the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But hafta, show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo bust the slang, whut my name?
It's the Redman on the funk thang
Psyche, you're motherfuckin right, tonight's the night
To do what I want to do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been ejected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk! Pass the 40 and the blunt and don't front
on the block, cause when you do front, brothers are gettin stomped
I'm not a addict, more like Puff than Magic
Then pass it when I'm through cause my crew gots to have it
I don't claim to be a big rap star
cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin
Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggaz ain't playin

Fat black bitch! Nasty..
bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch

Turned up shoes havin ass..
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker!

You want to see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
cause the lyrics and tracks, make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smoov shit, I get down wit the boom bip
like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoe's kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike'n'Ike's
Hanging out wit my niggaz, my niggaz
The {Pack Pistol Posse} keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the 40 between my lap, coolin, rollin down the highway
Blunt system pumps cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
cause, we can do that black, so get the bozack jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
and watch the ba-BUMP, ba-BUMP, make ya speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
jump, jump, jump.. jump, jump, jump
But if you want to see a fly but frantic
cool romantic, more Slick=er than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smoov shit
cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggaz fucked up by letting me make an album (How come rude bwoy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin style run

In this corner we have the funk body snatcher
P Funkadelic and I gotcha hard enough
That I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block

Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush your whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk

That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause 92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose
(Poo pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on

You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3 you're pinned

I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice then Tupac

You heard me, my brother
I'm laughing, time 4 sum action

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer

Straight from the land of the lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That makes you run your rap style back to the crack vile brotha

Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk stroke a trunk of funk
Then you saw caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw raps

So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick

Just to show you where the hell I come from

I get dumb with the 1, 1 2
Check my rep, I'm a hit when I have sex

Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff

While I pour a lil' funk down your brain punk

Listen to my name chump

Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and

That's why I make it do what it do, baby, yeah
You want some, yeah, niggas hit the floor
When I kick in the door, wave in the four four
For sure, Uncle Snoop, where's the coupe?
'Cause I keep a hoe fighting like New York and Hoopz
Strap up your boots, move around
Pick it up like engine number nine
It's mine, homey, Tech, what's good?
And it ain't hard to tell how I rep my hood
You a beast like me, rep your hood
Sign the check when I mic check, one-two

[Chorus]
West Coast niggas love getting it started
Down South niggas love getting it started
East Coast niggas love getting it started
But when we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
When we in the house shit get retarded
We came to finish what ya'll done started
""Everybody just scream!""

Aiyo, fuck your prognosis on who's the dopest
You get skate like super chronic holitosis
If you looking for beef, you know you gon' get it
Got ya'll niggas yellin' 'callin' the cops, get the paramedics'
Keith Murray, Method Man, Redman
Hip hop got Barack in his be-Boy stance
Like a nigga with no legs, you don't stand a chance
Against the Wu-Tang, Def Squad, L.O.D. wardance
One glance, watch Keith Murray hop out
In a hurry, cold like a McFlurry
No Mickey D's, show me the money like Jerry Maguire
L.O.D. for hire, I'm ready
I rep Strong Island, bums get rushed
I pack house like Biggie in Notorious
We warriors, who the fuck are you?
I pop an E and the gun go Pikachu
Niggas know how deep the crew, get at me
I'm nasty, but I went from ashy to classy
Got badunkadunks waving all at me
'Cause I be, doing my thing and making everybody scream

[Chorus]

Yo, Brick City, Staten, Long Island, we back
More violent on the track, black talent and a gat
Bomb shit, like a nigga wilding in Iraq
See the truth of the fact, niggas lying in they raps
Me? I'm a diamond in the rough in the cut
Like paroxide, got mine frying in the Dutch
Forget about your top 5, try and top mines
Take shine like I got mine ironing your guts
You know I keep it fired up, fire in the hole
To the game, old and tired, I be tired when I'm old
I'm trying to keep it hot like the pile up in the stove
While these rappers losing power putting powder in they nose
Meth, Keith Murray and Redman, yo
Fuck you and your mama on a headband, hoe
You can call the kid a modern day Van Gogh
Take the art to a place where the fake can't go
My chain and my pants hang low
Got my own namebrand, I'm the man made, bro
Cash in advance, I'mma blow up with the dough
Whoa ho ho, don't let me like slow up with flow

Method Man,"I wanna deal, with a bigger asshole
The streets, it's coming down hard
We got to get our shit together
We always had music, eating off the game
Like you was never gon' run dry, that ain't no business
(No other game is run so disorganized
Look around you, every hood that's taking care of business
Is together, dig it, tight?)

I can't spend my life running away
For what it's worth, how much dirt can I get done in a day?
I got, clip in the AK (a blunt in the tray)
I'm a beast (Fuck the police) N.W.A.
Ya'll play this game that the huster's play
And if you dress in the metrosexual way, then muthafucka, you gay
Ya'll can save this drama for Kay Slay, like who's fucking my chick
Or writing books about sucking my dick
Now I don't give a fuck what they say, 'cause once I put on my cool
They see my life and wanna put on my shoes
Top of the world, ma, look at your dude
I dig a chick with an attitude, but I don't let her cook up my food
It's like these young niggas hugging the strip
Who got the power to move bricks and buildings never loving the bitch
Stripping with game, ya'll can guzzle a sip, ain't nothing change
My niggas is off the chain, and we don't muzzle the pit, a-ha

""Can I get a suuuuuuuu?""
""Aiyo, this bounce right here for all my Wu-Tang muthafuckas in the house, tonight""

Soon as I, pick up my pen, I begin my flow
I close my eyes then write rhymes in a Blackout mode
My uzi, weigh over a ton, CD plays over
I do my crime with baking soda, with no odor
Pull out like boat motor streams, crack your shoulder wing
Def Squad decoder ring, psychopath bordering
My dogs shitting on your lawn, while you watering
Pay the fine, audit him and shit on your lawn again

P.O.P., nigga, N.J. deep, baby
Jersey state of mind, Method Man, lock 'em in
Ya'll niggas give a fuck, punk, we the opposite, yup
I hear you gossiping, 'cause we on
Just because I rock, don't mean I'm made of stone
My bones is sturdy, I wake up to get it early
When I bully the streets, my Co-D is Keith Murray
In a hurry, back down, the boy roll with us
This how it sound when them boys is transmitted
Bricks to Staten Island, where babies turn into killers
That's why my Cadillac bare more arms than caterpillars, let's get it

And I don't put no snow up in my cheeba
Pack a little heater, the game get colder in the freezer
Hit your little corner with the sweeper
Dance with the reaper, sharper than a fuck
Plus I'm laying in the cut like a half-moon Caeser
What you getting is the truth
My bird eye visions spot the pigeon in the coup
Same way I live it, how I spit it in the booth

Bust gats, drug raps, and pump cracks
What you trying do nigga, we done done that

Aiyo, I woke up in handcuffs, heard the police wanted me dead
Big bullets and splashing all over
Kingpin's still moving that weight
And his main goon burned up a disco tech
He's a hazard, classic, nigga, we got a flick of him
He jacked Nate, while he took the picture
And we tapped his crib, bugs all in the jacuzzi
Under the seeds bed, we found an uzi
Trully, and we know about his bitch in Charlotte
Pulled her over, State Troopers found two revolvers
And she told us them handguns ""That's my fathers
And I'm licensed to carry those shits regardless
Y'all just played my man, caught her with a million dollars
Worth of fireworks, coming back from Japan
It's nothing, y'all police be fronting
And stop looking at my pussy, like y'all want to suck it, I'm out
On y'all pussies, catch me next time, bye bye""

So I ask what's going down
Got a girl in the back, a blunt in the mouth
And a chain on my neck, hang to the ground
Hey, I said how you feel?
Baby look tough with a gangsta grill
I ain't rich, but I pay my bill
I'm like Jay, I'm trying to drop me 'a mil'

And I'm like 'yo, what's wrong with ya'll ?'
Got these girls in the spot, and I don't care if she a bird or not
Cause I ain't really trynna talk to ya'll
Got a pocket full of stones, grown with a pocket full of bones
I'm a class act, I follow with the chrome
Lane switching, got your misses on the phone

My hand on the pump, niggas understood
Bitch, I'm no good, I swear
Light shit up like Times Square, put it in the air

I got a bottle of Patron, I'm the only one that spent that cash
But everybody try to get they glass
Now we can all have a drink, if you trying to put some dough in the bank
But if not, ya'll can kiss my ass
I need a, Cinderella that can give me the loot
Better yet, a French vanilla that can give me the scoop

My hoes, my niggas, all move accordingly
Streetlife, I'm so international
My foreign exchange, but always in the capitol
Straight cash advances, while you be calling
Your label all day, hoping someone answers
I flow with no auto-tone, just me and my bitch
My blunt, my beat, my microphone
I shine with no jewelry on, another star is born
Watch me perform, beyond the norm
And when my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Brr stick 'em, haha, stick 'em, how about that, nigga?

Fuck what it cost, how about that, nigga?

And I'm official, just like them niggas that low the whistle

If you nasty, I shoot 'em with penicilen, you heard?
I'm like Cali, so carry, when I'm flipping the words
Flip the script on your bitch ass while I'm flipping the bird
Meth sick with the pen, stick a few in your men
Then again, stick with my pen through the thick and the thin
Look, when my niggas 'get 'em', I send 'em to hell
And ride with 'em, how about that, nigga?

[Chorus: Melanie Rutherford]
If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit)
If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more
Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit)
If you like it (a lil' bit) you can have some more

[Method Man]
Somebody tell honey I'm good, just like a licorice
Meth got 'em stuck in the hood just like a clitoris
Something like this track from Roc', ya'll, ridiculous
Don't touch her if I'm getting my rocks off, she ticklish
Now if I turn it up, shorty if you got a Dutch then we can burn it up
I ain't the type that need to drink to get his courage up
Half ya'll get a drink and think you murderers

[Redman]
Yo, I know you heard of us, Red & Meth, here take a photo
Walk in serious like Miguel Coto
Pimp in my mojo, swing in my logo
Def Squad, Wu-Tang, that's how I do things
Hit my blunt, baby I see your pussy a lil' bit
That's when I know it's on, it's time to head home
And we kick bitches out, around six in the morning

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
O.G. bubblegum, kush burn a bush
See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook
Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em til I learned to juks
Tried to catch something, everytime I work a hook
Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up
Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up
You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up

[Redman]
When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit
I know eyes on me, when I count to three
Make believe you was indeed a copied MC
You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit
I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me
It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
I got to be out, at the club door with the key out
Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out
Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out
Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out
Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up
Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up
A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up

[Redman]
Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch
Fuck you, that means she swallowed it
I do double on the turn, you must learn
Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm
If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit
Redman is on fire, so call him quick
You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick

It’s not a moment or a phase
But possibly the end of days
Watch as I stand up on the stage
Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane
They say it’s levels to the shit
I say it’s levels to your brain
You can’t acquire the higher
You’ll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money
And bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who can’t walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies

Expose em to superflames

The question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain

Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek

Leaning on his Rover jeeps
Smiling, showing all teeth
Seeing son in my hood, it ain’t all sweet

Idle times a devil

Point the finger at the bad guy, it’s me again
Who are they to criticize me?
I do it like a G
I’m a nigga from the mutha-fucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble

Welcome to the meth lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, back 'til you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
'Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
'Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you lie, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So at your court hearin', judge show me some leniency
Can't escape old havoc, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your car seat, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

What up, Street?
Yo, what up, man?
We gon' put some ""Welcome to the meth lab"" on there

Young buck I’m just trying to toughen you up
Can’t let you hustle with us, ya ain’t struggled enough
Ya’ll been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks

She tied you to her kitchen chair

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Watched our neighbor's house collapse

In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains

Pushed away I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

And when the days that followed past
In another mansion built to last
From our window we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back

Won't you keep me company?

Do you remember me?
We met out on the farm
By the fire, you spoke to me
And held me in your arms

The songs you played for me
I long to understand
All along the watchtower
And castles made of sand

When there was a wilderness, we wandered wild and free
Guilt, she is the governess that guides me back to grief
What if we were dumb enough to spend eternity
Gathering the garbage washed up on the beach?

Do you remember me?
We spoke by telephone
The bad connection had a meaning of its own

Of all the good and all the stupid shit I've done
The worst was all for me
Not hurting anyone

That the tide could turn so fast to this degree

Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain?
Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow?
If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside
It will find it's way somehow, somewhere in time
Will we remember all of the suffering
Cause if we fail it will be in vain

The Germans, by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks, have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the first day or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track."")

Then you came and lit a spark
Burnin' desire
House on fire

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But not that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light
Walk too slow and never been bright
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning To See the Light
Metropole Orchestra,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice,
Warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace
Rising to a starry height.
Each star its own aurora borealis
Suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the Midnight Sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me
Or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found
Me, suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the Midnight Sun
Midnight Sun

Was there such a night,
It's a thrill I still don't quite believe,
And yet when you were gone,
There was still some stardust on
My sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
Or I may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
I saw the Midnight Sun.",Midnight Sun

Metropole Orchestra,"I clearly recall the moments
Your face, the rain in Paris, a distant bell
Now, inside my head, I still recall the moment
There was something that you said

And now, only now, if somehow I were younger
Nimble little fingers remember each melody
Melodies and days that I adored
Flower vases, cathedral doors

So long to sailin', safe by my door
Sunny place inside, comforting is all paid for
Too late for some change of mind, ohh, how would I ever find me?
Through rain and crying you were saying

Every heart is safe inside a place
That makes and shapes the changing
Make the change, sail away beyond the wishing star
Dreamers gettin' armor

Froze in the altitudes, toasting the latitudes
Old empty platitudes, tossing, turning, freezing and burning
Comin' around, comin' around, settlin' down
Comin' around, settlin' down

Ice cream and thunder, night beasts and butterflies
Most mornin's I'd settle for a little rain
I'll let it in and let it out, I'll blow it over, coda
Start all over again, makin' the bitter end a friend

Play that restless melody for me again
The one I've been, been so afraid of my sweet friend
Maybe the little refrain will whisper inside the rain again
Play the one with all the changes

Some lullabies for sleeping, a lullaby for weeping
And one to teach my heart to fight and win
Singing a sailin' song
Sun song, sun song

Now inside my head I still recall the moment
There was something that you said
I live inside the moment
Hearing something that you said

How still inside the moment
There was something that you said
Remarkable and wonderful
This something that you said

Photograph of yesterday
And all its edges folded 
And the corners
Faded sepia brown

I can see such brighter days
When every song we sang
Is sung again

We know this time it's for good
And we're lovers once again

The nights filled with 
Joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies

There's a shooting star
Can you tell me
How I'm supposed to screw this up?
Add my tremolo
Likes to shine on yours and mine
All my emptiness
Is confined in metric rhyme
Make all your lies come true
I've been a liar too
Follow the things you need
Make your whole life complete

There's a puking girl trying
There's a puking girl trying
To defend herself
If spontaneously congealed into nothing

Idiot, you could have become you
There's a friend
Trapped in this dream, too

It's like I said before
Like in the notes you tore
Laying there on the floor
Until you knock the door
What did you hope to find?
Leaving it all behind

Should I say goodnight to you?
Really I tender feel for sin
Tell me honestly, am I adorable?

In her beautiful balloon
She's got hands
But she cannot reach the moon
Wish I was gay
Then I wouldn't have to play
All her games
Get her started

Close the door when they come in
They can feel their whole world spin
Smoking plastic shards
They'll never be scared of me
(I won't drown)
And when they change themselves
They are never afraid of me

Summer's out for you
There's no time for you

It is not what it seems
You're awake in your dreams
With lithium you'll never be sad again
But you can't sleep with her

It's not by choice, is it?
I hope you never come back
There's someone else in here
Please tell me why
Please tell me when

Saw the candy turn to corn
Well, it's like the morning's born
And I'll try to like horses
And I'll try to like horses
Now I'm there, you didn't know
Try to think about the snow
Don't be riding over me
'Cause you are all that I can see
I'll try to like horses
And I'll try to like horses

I'll be glad with Andy Pandy
Feed the horses with your candy
I'm the stray cat on your roof
Clap your hands and lift your hoof

So they went to their car
I was lost in the crowd when I
Tried to find my way
Nothing else seemed to matter back then
Soft encounter
You amplify my emotion
No devotion
May sound wrong but is sounder

And I know you have nothing to say
When you look like you did then
There's no point in playing along
Is there now?

So they went to their car
I was lost in the crowd when I
Tried to find my way
Nothing else seemed to matter back then

Last encounter
A goodbye kiss from an old friend
Can't stay long now
My train is headed for somewhere else

When you're gone I envy the people you're with
Cause they're with you
Nothing's wrong
I've just been here too long to pretend

Feeling so small
You stretch out beyond me
There comes a time when all I'm feeling
Everything belongs to you
I was counting on you then
Close your eyes and think of when

So they gazed at the stars
And he told her his real name
Said it wasn't far

Mending hand bleeding and
Lend my hands the wheel, you fly over me
Let it go now, you've been glad too
With my hand as the wheel you cry over me
I would like to be a child
Drown with me until you die

I thought I, I heard you cry
But it's just the wheels that ride over me
But then I, I know that's why
When I hear you sneeze

You're my dancing girl
I never thought you'd mean the world
It's why I'm here and why it seems reliable
So much time for us
There's nowhere here but there it was
The tale I had, and you became a friend again

I can hear them
They lost their sense and feelings
When you touch the wheel
I'll be alright asleep forever

I would like to be a child

Tell your goodbyes

I don't like your sparkles at all

Why is that fire old?
A green light is a red light
In your dreams tonight
It's like a battle, battle.

Christmas day is over

I told you why I am lonely
But you can't stay
Tomorrow, streets, blank faces
Stare unwilling

MF Doom,"He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery that Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Sorta with her drawers down quarter
The extorter bring slaughter like ""Well I oughta""
I suggest you hand over the formula doula
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woola with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44
Contemplate, meditate, dictate

By candlelight my hand will write these rhymes 'til I'm burnt out
Mostly from experience, shit that I learned about
Topics and views, generally concerned about
With different ways to come up and earn clout
I take a look at my life and pace the trails
From Tablik and savage females with fake nails to face veils
You out your frame but still bagging 'em too
You know I know, these hoes be asking me if I'm you
Like my twin brother, we did everything together
From hundred raka'at salats to copping butter leathers
Remember when you went and got the dark blue Ballys
I had all the different color Cazals and Gazelles
The ""SUBROC"" three-finger ring with the ruby in the ""O"", ock
Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block
I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand
Everything is going according to plan man",?
MF Doom,"I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob a lot
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumille
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition ""super-villain"": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say

Every since the womb ‘til I'm back to the essence
Read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like ""Pass the peas like they used to say""
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF the super villain!",Doomsday
MF Doom,"Big up all the Monsta Island massive
And beware before I triple dare you like the last kid
Who asked me what we don't got that you got son

Not so much to riddle, least rhyme to the syllable
Keep tracks that make a Arab thief clap
With no hands, I chopped these drums off

Actual fact, relax
In this land of lyrical lost, black
I'm not the cool sleestak
The one who might stop and talk to you
Poisoned a few, niggas who be biting styles I'm like pork to
Ooh, what you got to lose? Let mud fly
When I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry
So I ask why the styes from the cess
Shit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest
The super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand
Throwing emcees to the fire from out the frying pan
It ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying
Fronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying
Speak your piece only once you're spoken to first
Now let me hear your verse while I'm choking you
With well refined rhymes like a editor
Throw them to my collection of skulls and spines like Predator
Fuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (who?)
Was Jet Jaguar and James Brown

(Yeah, yeah only them two niggas?)
And I'm glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up

I'd like to say hi
It's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin
That's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling
Who eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling
Who see God toke but never see God hurlin'
My man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost
Me myself I got flavors that out-taste most
With numb gums, some rhymers is lactose
Back to you MF Doom, you late show host
S to the U to the P E R-uh
Who chronicle these times in a 3-D horror
Thriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama
Who break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower
Lone gunman who candidly flip fly flows
Single-handedly with one eye closed
In a fly pose, no shirt Alayé
May see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay

Motherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute",Go with the Flow
MF Doom,"I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats

Supervillian he wrecks clubs for dell
In a drunken stupor chillin
Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that plan of any rhymer, whiner or 
Spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose? 
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the mpb fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-d
The only reason I seek to stop to snuff the tv
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks lex luthor up in green haven
Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven
Misbehavin rap stars need mistament
Call me mista bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga want to do is fight and sell, tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
Bout to stop the violence right after these last three shots from the black 
Bat got me at headlock
Holdin on to sanity while stranded at dreadlock
She told me get off I said
Bitch, let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga come out and rock this nation like oxifacen
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the super like in your building
Villain like trife kingdom wear and all my children
Plottin and it sure to pay ends
With some more mature women's and more of they friends
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of big bamboo with natural glue
Who grip necks of becks next to triple x
He just came before d followed the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh snap, it seems you walked into a trap do wrap
Zoinks, this place is filled with pretender willies
One false move and get broke off like end of phillies
True believers ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh uh
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin off two gages with my cake gone wrong
Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad status rae dawn chong
Let me know if y'alls with me y'all
Nasty yo and geographic down to the titty bar
Rap monster outer city y'all

I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good we had a hotter date
It was just a number she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got and steadied the block
We bounce to the yeti and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments feelin a little loose
Blowin up in every spot we had a little juice
Probably the dime on the Afghani ?
We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me I'm bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with metal face's steel wheel (The mic)
What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes
And fine she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a song bird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off guard her game had me choked up
Checkin me play testin me (The mic) till I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you (Not a word)

Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her
Switchin off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my god father aside a gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin with these chickens I ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with stinkin mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that ?
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble

In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money
I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broke times

Better rhymes make for better songs, it matters not
If you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
Surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
Got get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks
Even if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe
To get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro
This fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks
""Oh, you're too kind!"" ""Really? Thanks!""
To the gone and lost forever like ""Oh My Darling Clementine""

When it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven

I told her - no credit for a bag
If you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gak
Only in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
And still keep your attitude on self-destruct

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
I'm saying - electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slit it to the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice
Keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
Gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
Never seen the shit again but he's still my dunny
The only thing that come between us is krill and money

Super

I got this girl and she wants me to duke her
I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said, ""Super""
That sounds great, shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like, ?Super?

Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring, super
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF Doom, he's like D.B. Cooper

Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, ?Niggaz ain't about shit?
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth, she can't live without it

And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous hoes shit list
One pack of cookies please, Mr. Hooper
It?s fun smackin? rookies, he is the super

Look like a black wookie when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown, skinned and always kept his hair low
Rumors has it, it?s a S-curl accident
Doom was always known to keep the best girls? backs bent

Some say it?s the eyes, some say the accent
A lotta guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
Only mess with high rollers, do what daddy told her

No matter the city, she want me to do the thang, thang
Work in the coochie, hooptie, chitty, chitty, bang, bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D of 'All In The Same Gang'

Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat, chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course he is the super

See most cats treat her like foofer
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the super
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything will be super

Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the super
Got the buddha, get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it

Listen here, scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag never let her fry the Ragu
Which will have you under some type of spell, crying, ?Dag boo?
Her name on your back in her tattoo

Whether a bourgie broad, nerd hoe, street chick
Don't call her wifey if you met her at the freaknick
You don't want her, don't waste her time, I'll dupe her
And be a father to your child like the super

He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em take his clothes, leave him posin? nekkid for real
Better yet, get 'em for the check off the record deal

Find out where he keep the tek and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let 'em know how you feel
And while he's runnin down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm comin with the you-haul, super

Super, super

MF Doom,"I get no kick from champagne
Their alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There is only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all their MC's and drink 'em under the table

Like it's on me, put it on my tab, kid, however you get there
Foot it, cab it, iron horse it, you leaving on your face forfeit
I crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
Told him tell they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him get off it and a bunch other more shit

Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he's drooping off
Soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough

The group been soft, first hour at the open bar and their trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him to autograph her derriere, it read
To wide load, this yard bird taste like fried toad
Turned love villain take pride and code words

Crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat, to dine by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skezzer eye

And squeeze her thigh, maybe giver her curves a feel
And the same way she feel it when she flow with nerves of steel
They call him super when they need their back or plumbing fixed
Powers only one left, the pack comes in six
Whatever happened to two and three

A hood tried to slide with four and five and got caught
Like, what you doing G?
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact not for nothing right now you and me

Looser than a pair of Adidas, I hope you bought your spare tweeters
MC's sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
Dude, can we do this thing again no matter how be blinging

You do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Telletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet

He plots shows like robberies
In and out, one, two, three, no bodies please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shootie, nobody move, nobody get hurt

Bring heat, like the boy I'm going to war
Came in the door and everybody on the floor
A whole string of jobs like we are on tour
Every night on the score coming to your corner store

Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock Black, Rock & Ron's goin' Barbizon

Ask 'em after ten miles in his goulashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible

And won't stop top billin' til he a gazillionaire

Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told em ""Firing pins was separate""

Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged an advance to translate it and ignored it, sorta

He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky

Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be singin' like a style

Smile, ding! Sparkling jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules

Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger

MF Grimm,"Her name is Life, loyal, would never do me wrong
With the best move she was a beautiful song
A schoolgirl, mastered biology
Taught me everything, she holla hollla at me
Beyond vision, totally internal
Trees, bees, birds, words, verbs, nouns
Took walks in the park
She was sweet but at time hard knock

Til I met Death, she took the last breath of me
I met her through her cousin Sleep
To the left, to the right, she went both ways
Yes chasing her was chasing Amy
Took me to the edge, told me jump with her
I was hypnotized so I jumped with her
Cause I wanted her, confronted her, between the sheets
I messed with her Life paging me want me to mess with her
Don't feel like being stressed with her
She wants to walk in the park, I want to run the streets
I'm acting real cold, she's giving off heat

She rather see me get a diploma
I go check out my homegirl Coma
Coma and I have a cool relationship
She give keys to the crib and don't ask me for shit
Sack the fridge for me to drink and eat up
I'm skeeming like a demon on the couch with my feet up
Pay-for-view championship bout
Main event didn't start so I slipped right out

And called Life from the pay phone she's chewing me out
She sensed that I'm cheating the way I'm moving about
A nigga from the streets is what you trying to be
Your sleeping around, stop lyin' to me
Life, you know you act like a bitch right?
Then we just die, that's why I get high
And she said my love you try to deny, but please give me a try

But Death's a fiend, public places having sex with me
The streets are watching us, stay hard when she's next to me
We don't love these hoes before we lust
She introduced to her girlfriend and off I bust
Menage-a-trois we must constantly
Together fuck the world criminology is what she taught to me
Feels so nice giving blow jobs in her mouth is glaciers of ice

I act up cause I'm backed up with virginous Life
Won't give it up until I make her my wife
Life want it all, I just can't win
Traveled back to Coma house and then I slipped back in

Coma love me ladies sexy as can be
She looks into my eyes and asks what's troubling me
Powers beyond are humbling me
Gotta pick one so which one will it be
Women like Death is all around the world
She said Life is wonderful a hell of a girl
She wants to share her world give you all she can
Death's a freak slept with every damned man
Life got your back she's picking you up
Death packs the gat straight sticking you up
Life can't live without you she's biggin' you up
But put Life after Death cops are diggin' you up
Life is precious she's one of a kind
Choosing Death over Life you lost your mind
Life is the one for you no doubt
Main event was over so I broke the hell out

And called life back how silly I've been
I took her for granted when she's my best friend
Nothing lasts forever one day it will end
But I remain loyal until then
Mentally strong she would carry me
Got down on my knee Life marry me
I feel so blessed because she said yes
Now I gotta break it off with Death

Tell her the right way don't provoke her
Cause how she livin' mi vida loca
I spoke to her, but she didn't listen
Straight face like poker
A joke to her
She think I'm bluffin'
But I'm not, things gettin' hot
As I leave her spot
She pulls a gun out
And says it's not over

Fatal attraction actions alter my mind state
Meet your fate cause up goes the death rate",Life and Death

Started rollin wit other niggas, knew they wasn't feelin niggas
Niggas had beef wit niggas, now he breakin bread wit niggas
Jealousy and envy, money leave ya dead nigga
Clip in ya head, throw ya in the bathroom
Inside tub, chainsaw rub
Cut down to nubs, bag like work
Thought he was my man, he was a motherfuckin jerk
From his face wipe smirk, flip the script kinda lurk
But I'm a gravedigga nigga, so I put 'em in the dirt
At first shit hurt, reminiscin' when we laugh
Havin' fun bustin' guns, but yo fuck it that's the past
Had to kill his ass, lose cannon want to scheme 
Free agent over cream switchin' teams
Can't let him slide, time to take this ride
Popped up the trunk, throw 'em inside

Didn't tell 'em shit, let 'em find out
From his maker, why he was aired out, FUCK 'em

Time to load the clips, then we take 'em to war. 
Niggaz want to flip, then we take 'em to war. 
Break a nigga proper, then we break him some more.

Who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders.

I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me,

With the pound-seven, I be creepin', rockin' niggaz, while they sleepin'.
Shots repeatin', leavin' faggot niggaz leakin'.
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin', marchin' to Zion.
'Cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion.
Word, son, niggaz be collapsin', cause my weapons is
Ready for action, makin' your heart catch contractions.
In the underworld, shootin' gallery niggaz lose calories,
'Cause my salary's based on fatalities.

Here I come to get some motherfuckin' wreck, but first I gotta, 
Um, vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set.
So let a motherfucker move a muscle.
When I tussle, they'll be piecin' niggaz back like fuckin' puzzles.
'Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin' mad noise, a bad boy.
When I was younger, always carried guns, I never had toys.

On niggaz foreheads, to makin' motherfuckers indian.
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder. 
'Cause I put holes in my beef, like fuckin' White Castle burgers.
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo' pound.
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down.
I see 'em, he's comin' out the fuckin' Coliseum,
And hopped into a B-M, shit! 
Put in my clip, and then I dipped into the ride that my man had, 
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide.
I'm rainin' on him, (faster nigga.) oh yeah, we're gainin' on him.
(Oh shit, he's with somebody else.)  Fuck it, put his brain on him.
Boom, boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat.
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver.
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin' up a cigarette.
Bang, bang, I left the other nigga wet.
It's G. Rap, baby, you know me.  You try to hurt this,
I split your fuckin top and leave a fingerprint on purpose.",Take 'Em to War

Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before

(Hey!)
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us?
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us (Didn't we run)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been?
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone?
'Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
(Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living)
Then just walk away
(We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving)
We don't have tomorrow,
(There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it)
But we had yesterday
(But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it)
Touch me in the morning...

Telling me to listen

Not only in my chest
But the heart of the streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre Beats
I am from the city of people who came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, what's up?
Exception shows me as the dead man walkin',
But reflections show this kid's still got it
Better be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family 'cause I'm not a human being
And anyone under my bubble that's coming in my spot, the top
Let 'em have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

Everything I write is played out, like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes on the wall but they don't know the past
Even if I told them at all they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all these dreams
And pull on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
It's just one, til the day come like Rocky's movie scene
And I'm on top of the world, look up the screen like this is me this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself from the game when I found myself from the cell
And I found myself from the fame when I lost myself to the pills
And you cannot mess with me still, seen the boys and they winning
Underdogs of the year Cleveland boys in the building
What the fuck is a ceiling I'm taking us to the top,
And when I leave the whole world drops, Lace Up Kells

Wasn’t prepared for, really couldn’t stand on

Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I’ll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that’s for fucking with me
And that’s for my dog
This because where you're going you're not gonna need that arm
The street’s is talking, Uh oh, here they come
Thirsty for that blood, Red rum, red rum
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the ‘high’s, crimes, and lies’ come alive muthafucka

I swear that I can feel 'em fucking with me
Every night I feel 'em fucking with me
Please God tell these demons stop fucking with me
Every God damn night I feel 'em fucking with me
Why? Please God",D3mons
MGK,"I'm humble because I know what it feels like
To be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me

I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around now I'm somebody

Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me cause I'm nothing like 'em, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he’s proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated
When inspiration, motivation was needed
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'ma keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listen in to witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirlin'
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive, head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
(Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world"")

I remember thinking I would rather die
Than go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I’m ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs
Everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back in forth, on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y’all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimpin’ on everybody and certain motherfuckers 
That want to get in my circle I tell 'em naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy
Naturally, and I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s, fuck ‘em I don’t even botha
And who knows what’s next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Mid-West, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level
Wherever you wanna go, everybody put they hands up I’m ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up

(Oh!), for the block I (Go)
For that spot I (Go), to the top I (Go)
Screamin' ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screamin' ""Motherfuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (fuck the world)

From the back streets
To the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Whoever would've imagined lace up
Could've got me to the finish like track meets
And when everybody’s hot, I’m past heat
And if I don’t need the fuel, don’t gas me
It’s been a long time coming
Since 100 words and running
Mother fucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then u know we gotta have it
Don’t nobody ever snitch, get pinched? You forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby’s mother 
Never’s gonna know his daddy
Tragic

Why’s the government gotta lie to get money?
Why’s the federal reserve gotta take from me?
Why we even fighting for another country?
Have u seen my city mother fucker we hungry!
Representing for the middle of the map 
Even though me and mine are coming from the bottom
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
Do u really think the Notorious Big would believe these guys?
All these internet thugs that the the media finds
You wanna talk about grind
Look in encyclopedia what name is in it I bet u see mine
Mother fucker this Kells
Skinny boy six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still I came out on t-o-p
This is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had on him was his headphones
So he picks a song
And he turns them on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape
In the kick in the bass
That’s the story of MGK

And live for the moment not by the past
Homie live each day like it's your last

All my life
I couldn't fit in like a bad shoe
I was always to square, too cube
Too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high school hotties
Now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The schools most popular lame
No friends
No style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep and never woke up again
Yeah, and my last prayer
Was don't ever let me end up
Like the people that's down here
Cause the ones that fear change
Be the ones that don't care
Look at themselves
And see somebody else in the mirror
But you could always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now
Is don't ever pretend
And live every single day like you won't see it again

And the mother that conceived
But ended up leaving me
I just wish y'all could see me smile
This big grin's on the TV now
Uh, and I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks
Ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob 'em on the block
Now they spot me in the drop
Middle finger up 
And that ain't gon' stop
I used to take orders
And now I make bets
I used to scrub floors
And now I sign checks
I used to push carts
Now I push songs
Yeah I used to be there
Now I am so gone
I fired myself
Found a job myself
Established my name
Then I signed myself
And what I tell myself
Is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long
I'll be by myself
I'm gone

So take my name

Before your dream's gone
Then you better go live it
'Cause whatever you love
Could be taken away
So live like its your dying day

I wish I could see their faces
When they heard your boy spitting
Wish I could know what they thinking
When they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing
That I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they wishing they wouldn't have said that shit
I came out of a dying city
Brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do
I did 'bout twice
Multiply that by the battles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration
Bitches more ice
Make a toast to the underdogs
Toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes
Used to talk reckless
But now I push Benz's
And rock Rolex's
Came from the city
And until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side still with me
And that's how we living
Ya mans don't change
Look its still the kid
Still cant tell me god damn thing

Now they say home is where the hate is
Pulling up, “Hi, haters!”
I know, I’ve been on a hiatus
Caught up in the lights I've been blinded by Las Vegas
Ain’t it ironic before I was twenty one
I put my future on the table and I won
See they told me, “Life’s a gamble”
Now this is my casino
Made sure my fellas good
Now I’m Robert DeNiro, sipping Clicquot
With the girl that held me down from the beginning
My team throwing up L’s
But it’s funny cause we winning
A million talked down, soon as I rose from the bottom
But opinions assholes now, everybody got ‘em
So they ask me why I do it
I do it for the streets
Heard momma got out the grill
Man I do it for the grease
Man I do it for the five pack of Hanes wife-beats
That I wore like everyday to show my brand new ink
Shit I remember working jobs, just so I could hit the dance up
Never have a date, so I really didn't dance much
Couldn't buy my own, so I just borrowed my dad’s tux
Told him, “Keep the loafers” kept it gully with my black chucks
So you can keep watching the stars
But me I wanna be ‘em
And I just beat the odds
I guess we can call it even
Cause he the underdog
Went from flipping patties at a Fuddruckers
To living lavish then a mother fucker
God damn!

We got stories for day man, for days
They just gotta listen
Hey slim
And if y'all don't know, that's like my best friend right there
But anyways
It's safe to say we're on our way man
'Bout time though
Do you remember when my dad kicked me out like right after we met
And I showed up at your house the next day with a U-Haul
Like hey, you wanna move in with me?
Matter of fact nah nah
Do you remember the time we had those two girls over
And Dub called like ""Yo these dudes tryna jump me up here at the Eth""
Oh that's when we called the store across the street from our crib the Eth
'Cause it was on a 100 and 30th
But anyway though man, we left those girls, sitting with the door open
Sprinted to the store ready to fight
And this fool goes like ""ahh got y'all I was just playin'""
Damn I still wanna whoop his ass for that shit.
Nah nah nah matter of fact,
You remember when you wanted to buy your first keyboard,
So we went and gathered up spare change, like everyday.
And walked into that bank with that heavy ass bag of nickels,
And they were looking at us like ""what the fuck?"" 
We too grounded to be Hollywood man
This about as Hollywood as I'm a get

Hold up
Okay I heard they want the classics
My life’s a movie like the Truman Show without the cameras
They look at us like we a couple Boyz N Da Hood
Four Brothers till the end like them boys in The Wood
So I Light It Up, for them Friday Night Lights with the team
In The Notebook, holding my Requiem for a Dream
I was Superbad in the class I just Dazed off
So I played sick and lived Ferris Bueller’s Day Off
Back in Coolie High, students used to nickname us The Goonies
Every night we blacked out, shit they should’ve called us roofies
Get out of bed Half Baked, roll another doobie
So many snacks up in my house they call the crib Scooby
Blowing oowie man I swear this As Good As It Gets

We ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here, prayin for a rainbow
To lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to

Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that I made it

Real family grows old, Real EST mufuckas representing

No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the Eastside

Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets

While my first born in here trying to get sleep

Try telling me that u can’t make it up
Out the city 26 dollars to multi-mill’s
Face inside of the XXL

Now the whole block wants me
But I'm all hers
And she's all mine
And even though her parents don't like me inside
Whenever her daddy comes around
We just hide
Cuz she doesn't wanna sleep without me that's why
I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Yeah, and she loves my sound
It's why I'm always around
One of the most popular girls
In the class
Could... attract the crowd
Yeah and she got me down
Touches the right place when I'm fizzling out
And all of her friends love me
Cuz at all of the parties
I make em bounce b-bounce
Uh, if I play the right song
She might take it off
Meaning her clothes
You know I love it when she keeps the lights on
Play the music soft
Yeah so that's what I do
Anything for my boo
But when I hear the knock on the door
I Shhh-shut up
Cuz I know my cue
But when they gone
I'm back at it
She loves this song
So I blast it
Dad gets home
I hide in the cabinet
Flip my switch
Like gymnastics
Uh and Imma always be there for you
You just gotta find my plug
I'll be right here waiting for you in the middle of these speakers
If you ever wanna find my love
So

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

Uh, and she gets older
But I stay the same
And as she grows up
Her opinions change
Now she's off at college
W- are the ones like me
I just hope that one day she'll come back
To hear another song from me
But till then
I just sit in her room and collect dust
Thinkin about us
Waitin for the day she'll push my buttons
And I feel her touch
And get that rush
But I'm not what she needs
So I power down
Then right at that moment
I was found
Hello, her little sister walked in
Knew it was love at first sight
Caught a little twinkle in her eye when I made a sound
She snuck back in the same night
And even though she knows that she wasn't allowed
I know all she wanna do is be near me
One thing is that I felt the same
Wanna tell her but she can't hear me
So I said

So turn me on
You set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll see me
So turn me on
You can set me free
Just look inside your speakers
And there you'll find me
There you'll find me

On the face and the hands
On a green colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflected
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turned them from oak to cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner

But as long as you feel it
I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface don't break my bones

Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin
Pale and thin

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason just as well
Their guns couldn't see us
There's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate
The rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
All alone",Future Reflections

I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them
Take everything they can steal

Don't forget your roots
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds and you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner
I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress
Rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want
But it's you who's being used

Under your black eyes, honey
Right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation
Every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store

The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start

MGMT,"Here, you focus
So I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong

How will I know if it's working right?

Light confuses
The tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines
I see the signs of aging

But if I try to feel at all I am deceived
My mind's affected
It's empty now
As I lay down
I feel alright
My heart is racing

Turn the noise on
I'd like to feed my poison
Assembly lines

Carry a velvet warning
To the yard

Which you know is not the same as love
Love is only in your mind
And not your heart

MGMT,"Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear anymore strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason there's no secrets to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold
Feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the loons
The disappointed look on the faces
That squint at the moon
Let's see it with shadows enhanced
And then vote to decide who'll advance
Silver jet plane, making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd've guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed
Or at least cynical
But someone might still eat the steaks
Even if they're tough
Spending the day
Chewing the fat
Floating away isn't rough but it's not enough
Oh Marianne, pass me the joint
The sandpaper's tan
Go-getters are surfing the point
And London's a scratch on the lens
It's over before it begins
Silk 'round her neck falls down to her shoulders
The older I get, the more I suspect there's a trick
But really there's no trip at all
That doesn't result in a fall
Or a faltering
But something could spit out the bait
Even if it's real
Rolling away
Missing a spoke
Close to the ground like a wheel but it's not a joke
Holding the line
Clutching the phone
Nobly wasting the night, but it isn't right
It's not right
Smelling for blood
Praying for rain
Running away isn't rough, but it's not enough

The low tide is telling me, when it's over,
To breathe in everything exposed
And comes back to cover me with a blanket
Being here's always changing tunes

The empty sky surrounds me but I can't see at all
Wide open arms can feel so cold
And you can sit beside me and tell me what it's
Worth
But I hope I die before I get sold
I hope I die before I get sold
I'd rather die before I get sold

If you find the soul that you lost
Frozen in a starry void
Take it within and hope the sight of blood
Can will signs of life to return
Back to the way that it was
Long before it made a noise
To keep on quietly reminding you
What's never created or destroyed

Wake as the swell peaks
The close-outs drowning the birds with roars
And howls scare the new unkindness
That picks and laughs at the carrion scene

Forces you see breath can always go into hiding
And wait 'til it passes over
Or stay far gone for all eternity",Siberian Breaks

MGMT,"Sometimes the windows combine with the seams in a way
That twitches on a peak at the place where the spirit was slain
One foot leads to another
Night's for sleep, blue curtains, covers
Sequins in the eyes
That's a fine time to dine
Divine who's circling, feeding the cards to the midwives
Who love those alien days
The nonstop alien days
Ooh the alien days

Must've skipped the ship and joined the team
For a ride
A couple hours to learn the controls
And commandeer both my eyes
Hey!
Be quick dear, times are uncertain
One month crawling, next year blurring
Decades in the drain
Monograms on the brain
Decide what's working and what's moved on
To the last phase
The floodgate alien days
I love those alien days
Mmm... the alien days

When the peels are down, it feels like traveling in style
You don't need wings to hover forty ton stones for a mile
And in the summer, virgin visions
Mindless humming
Numbers can't decide if the day's supposed to smile

Today find infinite ways it could be
Plenty worse
It's a blessing but it's also a curse

Those days taught me everything I know
How to catch a feeling
And when to let it go
How all the scheming, soulless creatures
Can't find dreamer's honey in the hive
If it's right beneath the nose

And when the light is new
The sky shows trembling cartoons
You don't need smoke to cover
Most of the world in a gloom
But here comes racer number 7
Watch my fingers ripping out the lines

If it looks like we could lose
If it looks like we could lose

MGMT,"My green silken river and two lights
I could almost touch the free walls
When we were evicted from the heavens,
Fast clouded-over bumbling eyes
Now peering out through a sinking
Cosmic smile, reversed completely
Flaming currents forced us to surface,
Wet purple gowns and blaring alarms
All for some milky perversion,
Nothing the spooks wouldn't be used to
Spoiled by an empty fear of violence,
The only time I've ever been dropped

The minute the mirror turned its back to me
My distinct conviction of keeping
Eternal sources piled somewhere familiar
Was compromised and tangled in knots
For all I know we were sleeping,
Arranged like Fate's vain infantry,
Stacked in unconscious opposition,
Blind and happy for tomorrow.",Astro-Mancy
MGMT,"Whenever I drift by the unknown
Feign like I notice a fundamental tone
The fine pedals open and close offended
More explanation and nothing shown

Kind of like if a friend exits without a sign
Glimmering like a precious stone
Maybe we share the dream for 20 nights in a row
I would feel better knowing that I was alone

Wherever scientists turn lead to birds,
Torment ignites essence, delights from the earth
What you find shocking
They find amusing,
Something else to soften a sadistic urge
When they tell you the extent of the vice
Then the prime time mission is to choke the statistician,
And like the senses that you're lurking behind
While it gnaws right through to your core,
Oh I'd twist it more

If you think that you're free (Free like a kite)
Watching as it flies by (Spy the unknown)
Focus on the quiet oars
Tell me how far you'd go (Go where you like)
Knowing your air won't last (Last one to know)
Would you feel better holding the stars up?

What if the beast escapes (Apes have it good)
And separates like a cloud (Loud like a fault),
Seeps into the hollow bones?
Wouldn't its eyes expand
And zero in like a scope?
I might feel better
Knowing I wasn't alone",Cool Song No. 2

Feeding time
Either hemisphere if it's summer there
Seeking you, taking a dive,
Streets realigned
Ooh ooh ooh
Stored in my mind

All I could do not to steal
All the fun in the world
From your little heart
And now I owe it back to you
But it's hard to catch it and let it go,
Find excuses to burn right through the grief
And to melt, to melt, to melt
Oh my poor memories

Down to a trace
'Til you forget that I'm alive
And you feel it's all right

But never by my side?
All beginnings are an end,
In the blackness there’s a light
Maybe you will only read
One or two letters at the most
Shipping crates might line the streets,
Every stranger is a ghost
Cashiers won’t deduct the pain,
Loneliness sleeps on the couch
Only noticing the stain
Once the color’s faded out
Let’s go camping in the cold,
Make a fire, buy a tent
Envision leather getting old,
Re-send pigeons that were sent
Try to memorize your smell,
It reminds me of a field
Crickets clearer than a bell
Have all their guts recast in steel
Birds don’t cry when echoes quit,
They trail off into the fog
Autumn hurts far less than sticks,
Knowing winter’s five feet tall
Generations of defeat
All assuming your the worst
They never tied the cans
To the back end of a hearse
Take your hand against my own,
If there’s a finger I can grip
Reassure me at the ace
Mine’s a black heart you could flip
I’ve come to terms with what I have,
What’s been given, what’s been asked
Turn my back against the sea,
And beg the serpent for a dance
But in the red dirt muddy towns,
Celebration of the dark
Children walking hand in hand
With the pygmies in the park
I can’t touch you only once,
You always leave me wanting more
So keep my feet within the house,
And stick my toes just past the door

Let me die when I’m in love","I Love You Too, Death"

What slips into the system
A light touch, a whisper that puts you to sleep
Don’t sympathize with the mystery disease

All it is is a feeling,
Pain in a dress too revealing,
A lost bond an old friend who likes what it sees
You can’t shake off the mystery disease

Lovers in a past life
Meet in the street close to midnight,
A last look sweet like the end of a dream,
Then fall back into the mystery disease

Go on, tell your symptoms to me
It’s not in any of the books you can read
It’s no fun to face what you don’t get to be,
But what’s one more to the mystery disease?

Floating impatience
Snuffs my limited sapience
Black smoke as soon as the pressure’s released
Deep space sighs, the mystery disease

Consumed by a weakness
Cut with perpetual unrest
You see stars, sunsets blurred through a screen,
Trap what you want, waste what you need

And when the west wind sweeps through the leaves,
Emperors of history fall to their knees
Small fronds can’t see the wood for the trees,
Left in the dust of the mystery disease",Mystery Disease

Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever

Hearing words that I have never heard

J'ai séché les cours pour rejoindre mes potes
J'me suis mangé des giffles et des heures de colle

Roll down slopes, fill our white coats with stains

Mia Doi Todd,"Thanks for your letter. It made me feel better. I was down,
And it gave me a lift; appeared the Goodyear blimp.
The tree out your window is covered in pink snow.
You put a few blossoms in the envelope. I didn't know.
Now on the sidewalk, outside my p.o. Box, I'm a parade.
I'm confetti of fuschia hearts. We are never really apart.

You dreamed of me the last night of summer.
You dreamed of me the last night of summer.

You were coming. I was leaving. We met in the harbor 
Where whaling ships dock. We threw some rocks.
Everyone wanted you. I was not immune to the fever 
That overtook the cast and crew. I couldn't get to you.
But I had a secret, a torch to give you. I stole an hour 
Or two to share the fruit I grew with you.

I dreamed of you the last night of winter.
I dreamed of you the last night of winter.

(Hidden treasure, buried long ago, of immeasurable gold.
I'm drawing a map, connecting the dots, fusing the past to the present.)

I must always remember our moments together 
And believe in magic. It exists just beneath the surface.
New York City thinks it knows everything. The buildings, 
The people threaten to crush your body, your mind, your soul.
But you keep writing, and i'll keep writing, and one day 
The story will be told. All our oysters will unfold.

You dreamed of me the last night of summer.
I'll dream of you the last night of winter.",The Last Night of Winter
Mia Doi Todd,"Luna Lune,
Let me see your other side.
One you never show to the world
Show to me.

Luna Lune,
You are all reflection,
Sign, symbol, second nature.
Reveal yourself to me.

Luna Lune, luna lune,
Lay down and deep with me
In silent space.

Here you come and go again.
Here you come and go again away.

One you never show to the world
Show to me.",Luna Lune
Mia Doi Todd,"I am a human being.
I'm made of muscle, bone and blood.
I'm full of awful feelings,
Self-hatred and mistrust.

I need you now to be here with me.
I cannot reach the light.
I need you now to believe in me.
I've been giving up the fight.

I am a selfish monster,
Cold-blooded and remote.
My words are flaming daggers.
They send you up in smoke.

I need you now to abandon me.
My heart is in a knot.
I need you now to put your hands on me.
Let's give it one more shot.

I am a reckless woman.
I always make such a mess.
I follow my intuition
Into the vampire's nest.

I want to change for the better,
Clean the slate, be good forever.

I am a human being.
I'm made of muscle, bone and blood.
I'm full of awesome feelings
Like unconditional love.

I want you and me together,
Faithfully and through all weather.","Muscle, Bone & Blood"

And all my appliances, all compliances.

Closed to traffic, all that racket.
You are the opposite. I could never fit 
Into your apartment.

Are we going to give up or (are) we going to try?
Are we going to give up or (are) we going to try to learn what life is?

The tide comes in, and we're caught 
By the rocks and the wetness neverendless.
We kiss for the first time, our lips and tongues 
Tied in fitness, infiniteness. 
Then the ocean pulls back somehow, 
To reveal a crowd of uncertainty.

Are we going to live up to the words we said?
Are we going to live up to love we made? Made? Made?

A house, a garden, a family tree, 
Fruit aplenty, all varieties.
Desire fulfilled, inspired until 
The awakening from our daydreaming.
Here in reality, what we make believe
We can make happen.

Are we going to give up or are we going to try?
Are we going to live up or are we going to die tonight?

Mia Doi Todd,"Looking for a window into your soul.
If and when I find it, will the blinds be closed?

I drag me up the drainpipe,
Leap for the fire ladder.
Seventeen stories,
And I'm still climbing higher.

Looking for a window into your soul.
If and when I find it, will the blinds be closed?

I went to Samy's Camera
To buy binoculars,
Took home a tall telescope
Ten thousand times power.

Looking for a window into your soul.
If and when I find it, will the blinds be closed?

I set up on a rooftop
Just across the way.
In the summer, sweat poured.
In the winter, it was rain.

Looking for a window into your soul.
If and when I find it, will the blinds be closed?

Mia Doi Todd,"I've been looking for a way out
Of this crazy situation now
The world in crisis; seems like paradise 
Was lost and won't be found
And all of life is endangered 
And on the verge of breaking down.

I wake up all fear and dread-locked
By all the things I cannot talk about.
We built our house of cards on ignorance, 
A landfill of deceit. The walls are hollow 
And we listen, worry what they will secrete.

Woe woe woe woe is we.

We all know they've got it fixed 
In politico-economics.
We're junking bonds; we're dropping 
Bombs we've made by guzzling gasoline.
Public confidence is shaken 
Like the apple from the tree.

Namu Amida Butsu, gomen.
Forgive me for my trespasses.
I do my best to exist east of Eden, 
West of garbagetown, over-accumulated 
Karma. Armageddon, full meltdown.

Mia Doi Todd,"We sit in the grass and we talk of our pasts, 
A rollcall of all our lovers. 
A feeling arises we both recognize. 
We could fulfill each other. 
What if we do? 

We each have travelled and come to a rest.
We're trying to make things happen.
Neither of us know how to measure success.
Hey, we could fall in love and be happy.
What if we do?

All the butterflies rise to the surface. 
I say stupid things when I get nervous. 
Watch the sunset, forget all the chatter 
All the butterflies say it don't matter. 

It's getting late. We had better head back. 
We could stop and get some dinner. 
There's a full moon rising, the stars are aligned.
We could spend the night together.

Un'attesa, pari a un'agonia. Troppe volte vorrei dirti: no

Le mani tue, strumenti su di me,
che dirigi da maestro esperto quale sei...

dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra' per una notte...
... E cresce sempre piu' la solitudine,
nei grandi vuoti che mi lasci tu!

Rinnegare una passione no,
ma non posso dirti sempre si' e sentirmi piccola cosi'
tutte le volte che mi trovo qui di fronte a te.
Troppo cara la felicita' per la mia ingenuita'.
Continuo ad aspettarti nelle sere per elemosinare amore...

So - no sempre tua, quando vuoi, nelle notti piu' che mai,
dormi qui, te ne vai, sono sempre fatti tuoi.
Tanto sai che quassu' male che ti vada avrai
tutta me, se ti andra', per una notte... sono tua...
... la notte a casa mia, sono tua, sono mille volte tua...

E la vita sta passando su noi, di orizzonti non ne vedo mai!
Ne approfitta il tempo e ruba come hai fatto tu,
il resto di una gioventu' che ormai non ho piÃ¹...
E continuo sulla stessa via, sempre ubriaca di malinconia,
ora ammetto che la colpa forse e' solo mia,
avrei dovuto perderti, invece ti ho cercato.

Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the
Eye of the tiger

Mia Sable,"I caught your secret code
It was traveling low beneath the conversation
But I've had my nose to the floor
Ever since I caught wind of your motivation
And how you think you're sneaking up on me
Creeping up on me

[Chorus]
How the tides have changed for you and me
Our story has reversed so perfectly
Now you're here on your knees
And irony never felt so sweet
I can taste your heart between my teeth
You're crawling back to me
Oh, you should be

I saw you move in slow
You were slithering so in all your desperation
But I've had my eye on the door
And I won't fall prey to your orchestration
And how you think you're sneaking up on me
Creeping up on me

Once upon a time I tried to convince you
Not to throw my love away
You were so unkind, I stayed inside and 
Cried the night into the day
The tables have turned, and I have learned
What I wish I'd known so long ago
Love isn't blind, it wears disguises",Secret Code

And we gon blow the roof right off this muthafucka
For the niggaz ridin with this TRU click, it ain't No Limit
To my loyalty and strong arm authority
Admit it, I'm finna show day to day soap opera
Downtown hoes unload when the ??? choppers knock ya
Head off in a split, put ya lips
Around this plastic dick, a Kodak moment
For this click, I don't mind dyin, takin a stand
In line, while bustin my 9

Mamma cryin cause I know this don't make no fuckin sense
But I gotta clock cheese, to get my Gs
To stake my keys, to make OZs

Steady mobb'n, you muthafuckas know my name
Down for whatever at the drop of a dime
With my TRU niggaz cautious on my rhyme, pick up my 9
Like that, but we be comin like this
Don't fuck with this click or ya might get lynched
Have your mama at the funeral, tissues, weepin
Due to the fact you got caught up in a street sweepin
No hesitation, you layin a stank
C-Murder will kill for any TRU soldier wearin a tank
We stick together like crazy glue
Ya'll read about the hatas tryin to infiltrate my fickin crew
Bow down, and give No Lomit it's props

They asked me would take a bullet for ya homie
Ready to die for any stomach with a TRU tatoo on it

Get her there, her central plans have been deviated
Tell em' why, her ho styles have yet to be appreciated
She's been waiting to see the fire from a real ho
No doubt who brings the noise like them bitches in a jailhouse
From el jay, or even worse a setback on a cold day
Those who play I hate, let it be known that I regulate
Will steal ya fate after just one rhyme
And chick ya left a buck jump after second line it's my time
So I bust without hesitance, every word man is evidence
Niggas clear the way cause ya lyrically impotent
Soft and mama likes it hard no doubt
I ride with the tank takes shots for the south

[Mia X]
I came to this country with my mama
Everybody called her the white girl
But you all knew I had a lil' somethin' somethin' on me
Cause my outer was slightly tanned
Southern folk called me a yellow gal
I've been out here in this world for a while now
Bringing madness and mayhem to man, woman, and child
You see my mother, the white girl had several lovers
So my father's true identity has yet to be discovered
Some call it A-1 soda others V-12
Doctor Tishner has been implicated
But all of their seeds are incriminating evidence
As far as my perception goes
My mother, she was indeed good, but I was most powerful
Just ask anybody in your hood
You can even ask those in corporate America about this mobstress
Most times, I as little as a pea, though my weight fluctuates
Size ain't shit, cause I have enough game to make you steal from ya mama
And call her out by her name
I can make her neglect her children, sale her body, perform dirty tricks
On her knees and be called the neighborhood hottie
Everybody's a thief and a liar once they make my acquaintance
They be anxious to buy my love, they lust for me
Want to hold me and test my purity, but it's only for a moment
You see the ecstasy that I give to you
It's only temporary but quite costly
I'm bossy from your very first encounter with me
I tell you, you need me, gots to have me, can't live without me
The pea, my game extends, it gets deeper
You see my skills don't pimp just the weak minded
The so-called big ballin' brothers are obsessed with me
They kill, rob, and plot on one another to possess me
They see me as a goddess
The financial path that will lead them out the ghetto
But don't they know, have a clue
That I and my mother were sent here to destroy them
To entice, baffle, and trap them
Conscious people call the conspiracy genocide
Well, what do you think
I mean you make money off me, while they pile up evidence on you
Then get you to spend all the money you're stackin'
On lawyers and bail bondsmen
They seize your property and worldly items
That have you caught up in this lifestyle
Material things that turn friends to foes
Woman to hoe, man to monster
Yeah nigga you've changed but so what
Cause I give you what you need I give you power
Make you feel invincible right by me
I make you feel like a big man, timer
No matter how fat, ugly, illiterate you are
I make the prettiest women love you
Fight over you and compete with others trying to give you babies
I make your relative, want to kiss your ass
Treat you like a king and roll out the red carpet
They've got one hand out for money
And the other hand has a pen in it so you can sign your life policy
My assistance makes you have that edge over the next man
Cause it's all about me and money, the root of all evil
The necessities of function in this society
I make all your gangsta dumbass stories interesting
Cause you are the man
I mean we listen in awe as you speak of your murder tales
Ménage a trios, homosexual advances, and secret romances
I'm bout it and I make you feel bout it bout it
I split family, split friends, split lovers and even business partners
So niggas nickname me crack, ain't that something
I'm the reason why a lot of people are homeless, crazy, crippled
Why they're HIV positive and dead
But you still want me, feel the need for me to be in your possession
Fear to get high off my intoxicating little pieces
Or to spread my love to profit
You're even willing to kill and die for me
And even though my mother, the white girl
Engaged in several orgies for my creation
I still know my father, you know him too
You follow his lead, and work with him
Claim you hate him but your actions are different from your tongue
Let's face it, you serve him faster than you do your God
We own you nigga
And as far as the ones that send I and my mother here to destroy you
We own them too
So after all my destruction, I must pat myself on the back, uh uh
I am crack, the devil's daughter
Human life, minds destroy ya
You need me, yeah ya do, for sho' ya do, you really do
So go head on nigga, take a hit
I'ma keep putting you out on the streets
Freeze you now, help me to kill you
Hoodlum poetry, food for ya mind
Wake up deaf, dumb and blind, it's time
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
I'm the pimpstress, and I own you
I'm the masteress, I'm the mobstress
And I own you, I'm trying to kill you
And I'm succeeding, yes I'm succeeding
I'm trying to kill you and I'm gon' do it
I'm gon' kill you, I'm gon' kill you
I'm gon' kill you, and it's bloody",Hoodlum Poetry
Mia X,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, hey yeah, ahh no
So much yeah, ooh

There's so much trouble in my life
Sometimes it gets so bad I just breakdown and cry
I got my rent to pay and it's overdue
Don't wanna sale my body just to make it through
You see I can't depend upon no man
To be responsible or even understand
It's just the way it is at this point and time
Sometimes it gets so scared unless it blows my mind
Me and my homegirls, we got a plan
Every night at seven we'll take things in our own hands
Now we can play around, let's make some ends
I got my hustle on cause money's my best friend

I wanna be stress free, rest easy at night
But there's so much drama goin' on in my life
These days, nights missed get you labeled naive
And commons get taking for stupidity
So I keep my guard up in this macho world
Cause everybody's running game on mama's little girl
We getting babies from shady, wanna-be playas
Who wanna lay us, stick ya, hit ya, forget ya while we stay up
Crying till our eyes are swollen
Single mothers got the weight of the world on they shoulders
Want em' to hold us and tell us it's gon' be alright
Even the hardest sister needs a good man in her life
I paid the price and my life is still in a damper
After times of dirty dancing, get the babies pampers
And don't talk about the welfare and how they knock us
Knowing that chump change can't provide nothing proper
While the doctors give us new-age birth control
They make the swollen to skinny
Bleeding constantly or missing monthly, scrapping pennies
While my kid's daddy slinging those Z's
But ain't doing shit for neither one of these
Should I ease up, grab a case, and set it off like Jada
Break with the paper, get in a comfort zone from pullin' capers
Makes us wanna holler, scream, and shout and say
Oh father, why I got live this way

[Chorus]
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)
I don't know why I live this way (I don't know why I live this way)
I don't know why I live this way (Don't know why, I live this way)

All my sisters keep ya head up, we ain't giving up without a fight
There's been a struggle but pretty soon we gonna bubble
Though trouble be knocking on my door like every 24-7
Heaven knows that I like to keep the bills in check and
Letting my kids down on they birthday
Gnaws at my heart and tears me apart
Can't let it go like this
Racing through the malls at Christmas time, Babylon
Got my mind on trip, December 25th ain't gotta bit
To do with Christ or his birth
Greedy devils give us pagan, holler
And profit off us give praise for better days
Better be ahead of what I said
Third, I can see I can destroy the mental chains on our enslaved brains
Cocaine, be the aim, be the means of profit
But logically it tells me I'm going to jail and getting killed
Oh well, I gotta do what I gotta
Until a new day when I don't have to ask why I live this way

That nigga just a rep hunter
I'm only doing it to get up under
Yo skin, show you that your nigga dicking
Me, talking bout the things he can do for me
Please me, spoil me rotten
The feelings that he had for you they are forgotten
While I'm plotting on the Swiss and the cheddar

Got his face in my pussy

Mama's trying to do all she can to get through the tough times
Press rewind and go back to early days
And I would do it all the same way
Keep my babies, yeah I struggled
But God ain't give me more than I could handle
Sent me two angels when my life was tangled in knots
And they're all I've got
My everything so pure and sweet
Two perfect little parts of me, the heart of me
Mommie, pulled some rabbits out some hats to pay the bills
And fix ya meals, cause you both gave me the will power
To tower over obstacles in our path
And when I'm sad, ya innocence makes me laugh
So glad to have a son and a daughter, so I strive harder
To keep it tight and bring comfort in your lives
And I try not to bash ya dads and bring you in the drama
Though you both know I've been the daddy and the mama
And I'ma keep doing all I can
To make a strong black woman and man, out my angels

Don't need to play no role and I don't hold, rap, or move the dramas
For the way my flowers blossom
I'ma put it down and keep it real for the both of you
Expose you to life, let you know wrong or right like
If y'all sell dope you might go to jail or get killed
If y'all use drugs y'all will destroy ya minds, lie, and steal
Lose ya self-respect, essence and ya pride
And mama won't succeed the birth of ya rise, so strive
If y'all sleep around unprotected
Expect to have a bunch of little children
All diseases that can't be cured and
If y'all quit school ya play the fool that's half steppin'
Intelligent black folks are our strongest weapon, get ya lessons
Vocal sessions on the regular, eye contact
I'm ready to take responsibility for the mine's act
So save that blame it on him, her, them for mine
I'll have to find the time to shape their little minds
They're my angels

I'ma carry y'all till y'all can carry yourselves on ya own
Hugs and kisses way after y'all grown
Help ya out when ya need but stress independence
Unconditional love, that's my life sentence, no repentance needed
This is how it's supposed to be
And I'ma keep my children close to me
Hope to be, the best mama that I can
Precious Lord please take me by my hands
And guide me with ya righteous wings
Cause I don't want my babies to regret a thing

That I flows everything over knocks 
With the peep by the pound 
And the ice cream shop 
They finally drop the first lady off that No Limit tape 
And I'ma act a plum fool baby think I ain't! 
You can't see even if you had a bird's eye view 
Or bifocals, these mind vocals just goes 
On and on, you know you can't resist 
So let your head knock back and look forward to this, Miss 
Biggest Momma with the Drama and Prada 
Fly known rigotta and my ice just gotta 
Light up the room like Vegas 
Been by my papa,ever since my flight that China white 
Peelin' wit' the steel, recognize the real 
Better rimes and bring skills I will 
Keep it locked,word to my moms dreadlocks 
Some nights I just want to set the party on top 
Wit' P and the Ill Na Na,unified hip hop 
Mo' chedda as long as the party don't stop 

[Chorus]
We don't care if the party don't stop 
Got nothing but time so let the beat knock pop 
Bangin' to the east 
Shakin' it to the west 
Throw it up Northside 
And the south gonna handle the rest 

There ain't No Limit to this game I spit 
36's on 55, I got money to get 
It's the I'll na na wit' the Big Momma 
Now I'm the Big Poppa,I mean a Big Dada 
I used to make my money husting' and bustin' wit' gats 
Now a days I get money for bustin' rhymes and raps 
I got the cocoa and cream, not the kind that steam 
'Cause it's crispy and clean 
Cristal and green, uh! 
600 wit' that 28 inch wheel
Word is 50 wit' no dollar bills 
Pearl presidential wit' that big and best
Tears on our backs but they still can't handle 
Independent black owned and I'm 'bout it 'bout it 
That's why No Limit is rowdy rowdy! 

[Chorus]

Uh, you know that na na don't fake none 
Millions by the Mason 
Shit, money I'ma take some 
Ask P, he know that Fox gettin' nasty 
Little sassy ass, 'bout it 'bout it 
Hoes know I don't play that free shit 
Make 'em lick my shit hard 
Then leave that nigga with his dick hard 
Huh, you got to work me to hurt me 
And when I'm bored fuck around on how you jerk yours 
From NY to NO, niggaz know they my hoes, bringin' my doe 
want to floss wit' me in the front seat of your 3 
Hundred Benz-do, watch us work them ends though 
Baddest bitch with that multi platinum clit 
Peep this, don't let a trick fuck you when I know you lick
Ice Cream Man 

Wit' the ill na na and this Big Momma 
That's why the party don't stop

Hey, yo Mia!

[Mia X]

[KLC]
What you think about this beat right here
You can do something with this

[Mia X]
Shit, man KL you motherfucker this beat is fire

[KLC]
Now that's what I'm talkin' bout
I need you to drop some mackin' ass shit off this
You don't have none of that huh

[Mia X]
Nigga you know I got some of everything
I'm Unlady Like (Door Knocking) Who that is

[KLC]
That's ya beat

[Mia X]
Oh, OK well come here baby, why you holdin' up, you know I love you
I know you still ain't trippin cause you seen that nigga downtown
I don't care nothing about him
You ain't seen no kissing, you ain't seen no hugging, none of that
No emotions cause I give all my emotions to you
You want me to make you feel extra special
Now look at ya I see you trying to fight that smile back off ya face
My baby, please don't give it to me, now give me some sugar
Alright now, you know you my million dollar nigga
So why don't you go on and make it happen for mama

[Verse 1]
See I flip scripts on niggas blow they mind like the wind
Iceberg Slim pimped hoes, but I got my money and clothes from him
Gator skin boots and purses for my slick verses
When I ride it I twerk it, leave they body jerkin' and twitchin'
Then I position my frame of thought
Spit game, eye contact so it can soften his heart
I lie if I have to even cry if I have to
But in the end it's the law, they gon' buy what I ask for
No rushin' I make sling it all then bring it all to me
I used to be a rider, flyer now I'm retired see
I took lessons from Big Vie and 67
She still got them niggas down to do whatever
I ain't gon' lie it's well known, I'm a fool in the bed
And I understand full blown, niggas suckers for head
Raw skills leave em' for dead, toes curl then shed
Moaning, sighing, shivering like a little ol' bitch
Just the art of pimpin' and pussy whippin' excites me
After hearing the show ladies want to be just like me
Shiesty, to keep my queen property and nice ride
My game's so tight it's unladylike

[Phone Conversation]
Hey darling, it's daddy put mommy on the phone
Yeah Barbara it's Richie yeah look I ain't never coming home no more
Take it easy

[Verse 2]
I ain't right, cause I especially
Send my nigga out to play on and flirt with other broads with big cheese
I even dress him and tell him to say the shit we like to hear
Tell her you want a commitment and want to build shit with her
Don't forget to lick the pussy nigga, eat your Wheaties
Cause you gon' need to bust about three or four nuts, no speedys
Cook the breakfast and the flowers only
He gon' comeback knowin' where the safe's at,
And he gon' take that and bring it on to mama
Send me off to relax, with my girls in the Bahamas
Sipping pina coladas
And I'ma be on the sand, plotting on his friends
Especially the dark one with the six-hundred Benz
His ends is long, he say he don't buy me shit
Two weeks later, that same nigga, I was driving his shit
With the keys to his crib, Prada full of his G's
Knew the secret hiding place for the China and weed
All my need he's trying to fulfill
want to be my number one, every time I make him come
It's like the boy gets dumber and dumber
Cause mama say I got him under a gree-gree
Take me shopping in New York, let them repossess her car, unladylike

[Phone Conversation]
Yeah, man your not ruining my whole day, just do what I say
Man just the other day I run into the law
He up and out left with all my ends, ya dig
Man I love my baby, I'm waiting for her to come back
She has been gone three months man, damn

[Verse 3]
Nigga, MC's is always talkin' bout the game they got
want to be pimps and playas but what about that beef cock
Heifer, that got you missing studio sessions
And got you calling her all day sweatin'
Is you the same nigga to get on a mic and say fuck a ho
Even though the one you love is up in ya bed, giving head
To the nigga that I sent, coming back giving me fifteen percent
Now, now I listen to your record and I laugh
You weak for ass, and you know this compare the math
Talkin' to a real pimp and I'ma drop it
Cool off nigga, I know ya mad but don't knock it
The truth hurts like life's a bitch
And she happens to be down with No Limit, and money shit
Mama Mia, x-rated, extra hard, extra tight, extra unladylike

Mia X,"This song is dedicated to all the responsible brothers other there
who's how love and support to their children
I'd like to say thank you
'cause I have a very important man in my life
He means the world to me
He helped make into the strong woman I am today
I'm talkin about my Daddy

Verse One:

I think back to the first time I messed up
You knew that I need to be
But you couldn't chastise me
Daddy's little girl
Most precious of all
You loved me more than anything
Your real life babydoll
Bounced me on your knee
Taught me how to throw my set up
Said you ain't got no brothers
Fight dirty
Don't take nothin
Saw you bustin your butt to keep the bills paid
Saw you hustlin for extras
For more pay you made a way
And tried to keep us happy up in the house
'cause you wasn't tryin to see 
Your queen or your princess pout
Doubtin out sometimes
But you tried to hide your pain
And be a tru playa in this white man's game
Never called my mama out of her name
Showed respect
Never put your hands on her
Even when she backed you in a corner
So Iwant to say you are appreciated
And this love song is dedicated to my daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Thank you Daddy
I know that I'm blessed
To have a father like you
'cause you've done your best
Under so much stress in the crazy world
God knows you tried
Even when they got your hands tied

Verse Two:

Remember when I came home seventeen and pregnant
And unexpectedly
But your disappointment never did show
You looked me in my teary eyes
Then you smiled
Put yoru arms around me
Said my baby's giving me a grandchild
Showed my boyfriend love too
Didn't come preachin or beefin
Just said you know what you gotta do
And when he didn't
You didn't rub it in
You just did his part
And tried to heal my young broken heart
I thought the things you said way back for certain
was jus to try and keep me a virgin
But with all the hurtin and the drama I been through
I wish I would have listened to you
'cause it was all true
Daddy the man who loves me unconditionally
through thick and thin
You'll always stand by me (fo sho)
Daddy I love you with all my heart
You're my souljah
My hero
My shining star
Thank you

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Verse Three:

I gotta give love to all the real strong brothers
Responsible daddies
Even if you're not with your baby's mothers
Your support
Your love and your time
Helps keep your children in the right frame of mind
And to the single fathers out there
Much respect
I'm a single parent too
So I know where you're at
And where you're coming from baby
But it's gonna get better
Hold your head through the stormy weather
And stand your ground firm
And all my sisters with good men at your side
It sure feels good to see the ??? family rise
I've cried joyful tears
Happy as can be
To see man woman and child
As one family
See the cards are stacked up against us y'all
So we gotta work it out
Can't let em see us fall
But most of all 
Thank you God
'cause for years I had an example of what a real man is
My daddy

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Oh I want to thank you for all you've done for me
I want to thank you",Daddy
Mia X,"[Chorus: see-Murder]
Don't blame me for the pain the world has caused
Don't blame me for your own imperfectionate flaws
If every individual were to accept his own blame
I think the world would be a better change
A better change

Nigga don't blame me cause my lyrics hittin your chest like gunshots
And my thoughts seepin into your brain like cooked rocks
It's like a thick I have on a nigga mind is ??? why'all
Sort of like ???????? of thugs
To break off from an overrated government full of corruption and hypocrites
That try to immoralize yourself when they untouchable by laws, that's bullshit
They say I'm overrated, but I'm highly educated
Incarcerated but reinstated and I know them faders really hate it
Rest in peace Malcom and King, TRU soldiers of the black folks
See while why'all gone, I'm a be a mouthpiece for the ghetto
I feel like it's my duty, I be elected through spirit
One of the chosen few soldiers from the infamous No Limit
Records, a cooliation of highly respected ghetto millionaires and servents
Just some independent brothers that deserve it
Now don't point your finger partner, just practice what you preach
Cause it really ain't my fault playa, so don't blame me

[Chorus]
[Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me
If I had my wish I'd robbin every day nigga wake
Cause if you let the world tell em my lyrics are the reason why
Lil niggas took the pains they can't take
Or the troubles he left behind
Why I gotta be the vision
I ain't even lookin at when your child choose music and he choose mine
But if you was a better parent he wouldn't look up to my kind
And time life taught me
The last minutes of your life is like bail, you either make it or you don't
You either goin love me or you won't
But don't blame me when your child ain't got enough to eat
And nigga I appreciate if you goin buy my CD's
But why'all ain't got a decent pair of shoes on his feet
The streets taught me you gotta accept your blame and don't blame it on others
I look at my mother and I watch her suffer
But we beat the bad times in uptown
And nobody gave a fuck, everybody came around
We made it on our own
And turned a fucked up life into a happy home

[Chorus: see-Murder]
[Mia X]
Don't blame me because my skin tone's like God's own
The oldest skeleton was chose to be an Africans born
I'm from a strong race of people who can never be denied
Every tear we cry's like rain water and so our sea dries
Ghetto flowers shades of ebony in full bloom
Women of color got sentenced, blessings unto our womb
They'd rather see us doomed, placin flowers on tombstones
But BeBe's kids multiply while why'all tryin to plum to save your own
Label me wrong because I spit the raw real
Why'all feel all my verses, even if I curse it's straight through em
Screw em, I takes my blame, you hypocrites make me sick
Tryin to sabotage my arches, thoughts stay on some scandalous shit
Get a grip on the way you truly live
Entertainment can't raise your little kids
Run your households
You got to mold their minds and tell them what to look out for
Gangsta rap won't be a cop out no more

[Chorus] - 2X",Don't Blame Me
Mia X,"Verse One:

Playaz meet me at the club 'cause it's goin down
Master P got a party and you know we gone clown
It started at 10 ends when you leave
So I guess that's tomorrow if you party like me
I can't see the dancefloor 'cause so many feet
But dead smack in the middle's where I'm trying to be
Valet got my Benz parked in VIP
No doubt that's the section for the cars all paid out
We in the house niggaz screaming T-are-you
More ice on our bodies than an igloo
Can we get you anything to make you feel at home
All expenses on us
Get your eat and drink on
Money really ain't a thing 
That's why the name's No Limit
Known for goin all out to have you all up in it
So let's get it started 
And the real tru playaz gone shine at the party

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Imma shine at the party
Sportin like 10 karats
Flex like seven figures
Me and all my niggaz
Gettin jiggy in the club
All eyes on us
And as far as money goes
y'all know what's up

Verse Two:

My girls mix hennessy with alize
We in full effect
Now we got that rowdy crowd
But all playaz ain't nobody tryin to get knocked out
The guys got the poker game goin on in the back
The ballaz baby the niggaz with the briefcase kinda cake
High stakes fo sho head bustaz at the door
You can't look in without four figures or more
The place is like a fashion show
Everybody's feeling right
Big face Frank-i-lins falling from the sky
It is our mama first lady of the tank
Major crazy bank straight flossin think I ain't?
Can't do how we do 'cause we all tru
Imitaters try to but that's on you
Boo a party ain't a party unless we give it
'cause the party don't stop

Chorus:  repeat 4X",Imma Shine
Mia X,"Somebody better tell these dumb hoes somethin
'cause when I roll thorugh I ain't gone say nothin
Ain't shit to talk about
'cause I can do without the souljah hatin
Them hoes is jealous of my fame and the money that I'm making
Got they heads aching 
So they acting like they got beef
Knowin damn well if they see me they gone speak
I'm Mama I'm respected y'all know this
But shits gone really get hectic
If y'all don't stop slow this ??? down now
The issue ain't who I'm loving or fucking
The big issue's billboard 'cause I'm on top of it
The issue is I got my kids up out the projects
And bought my moms a new house 
Before my second album came out
Respect my mind 
I took my grandparents out the hood
I'm seein to it that their golden years be all good
So bestill the fact that I ain't selfish or greedy
Ask my people am I there when they need me 
Like dat

Chorus:

I'ma leave you hoes in the same place
No progess
Talkin bullshit while I elevate
And I'ma keep looking out for the real
But I don't give a FUCK how the rest of y'all feel
And I'ma keep on learning the game
And I encourage all the my souljahz to do the same
I come in peace and I try to pack fair
But if you want to I will take you there
Like dat

Now I don't owe a motherfucker a god damn thing
And I earned the right to be the biggest mama on the tank
I sacrified beaucoup
Put in so much work
Kept it TRU 'cause I'm TRU 
And represented my turf
Downtown seven ward hard head 
Ya heard
Around a gang of uptown niggaz
Straight screamin the third
Been bout it 
Been rowdy
Been throwin for mines
It was just me and Jill on the scandalous rides
No hip hop lines to make me sound hard
It ain't no act
It's a fact
When it's on I go off
But as God as my witness
I love being nice
Until this playa setting in my household was right
I like to just be me
While you be with your knot
I'm trying to stay on top with TRU niggaz fo sho
And we extend our hands to pull up more

Whatcha Wanna Do?
And you better change your ways and start treatin' me right

I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin' like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin' to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin' to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin' stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin' and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin' love all night, callin' me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin' on that path?
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Cause my heart is yearnin for your love
Cause my heart is yearnin for your love

Now we been through all kinds of drama
But I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mama
I'm tryin' to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin' in and out, messin' with my feelings
Playin' with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin' more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin' sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin' me your ex
Can't keep runnin' in and out
Can't keep runnin'
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Cause my heart is yearnin' for your, let me inside your love
My heart is yearnin' for your, let me inside your love
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Now what we gonna do?
I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself
And I feel like that's what I've been doin' lately
It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that
Now you runnin' wild out here(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Gamblin' with all this foolishness in the streets
Whatcha gon' cry about? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You know what me and you had was real
Why you tryin to let it go?
If you wanna let it go, that's cool too
(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Cause I'm lookin' for a Mr. Do Right
I was hopin' it was you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
Cause when I first met you, that's what you was to me

Secrets of love, lurking beyond, rapture me now
I know your passion is mine
Sun cast waves are frolicking along the foamy shore
I surrender to you, paradise

Butterflies are flattering the top of strings
I surrender to you, paradise
Moonlight playing up and down a drifting waterfall
I surrender to you, paradise

I surrender my love, when you want me, you need me
I will be here giving my love to you, paradise

Miami Sound Machine,"Sorry to hear
She wasn't all she seemed
That she made a fool of you
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me

Sorry to see
How blind someone can be
'Cause she never cared at all
Yet without even trying
You made a fool of me

[Chorus]
There is no way for me to hide
The pain inside
A love that fantasy kept alive
I seek the truth but cannot find
I need a way to justify
Why you made a fool of me

Sorry to know
Love was the perfect crime
Caring a waste of time
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me

[Chorus]

Sorry to know
Love was the perfect crime
Caring a waste of time
But while you were crying
You made a fool of me

Mic,"Sittin' in the rain
Water on your brain
Got a hole in your boat
Trying to stay afloat
Has got you down
I've got a wind in my sail
Rubber boots and a pail
I'll throw you a line
Rest assured that I
Won't ever let you drown

[Chorus]
Cause when you're up against the wall
You know I'll be here for you, for you
When you rise and when you fall
I'll always be here for you, for you

When the plans you make
Fall through and take you
For a loop
Or some bird has flown the coop
And left you stranded
Just lean on me
And together you see
We'll carry the load
Even if we don't
Quite understand it

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",For You
Mic Donet,"Never stop loving you! Can't stand losing you!

You know I would do everything to make you stay - but I know I can't,
I guess I have to better let you go your way - I won't hold you back.
To make it easier for me, you wanna be the first to leave
before I will have to in the end
Don't dream your life but live your dream, that is what you said to me,
Baby, until we gonna meet again

[Chorus]
I will always love you, no, I'll never stop loving you, baby!
I don't wanna lose you, no I can't stand losing you, baby!
I will always love you, no, I'll never stop loving you, baby!
I just can't stand the pain, of losing you!

I'm gonna miss your beautiful soul around mine,
one like yours is hard to find,
I'm gonna miss your beautiful spirit and mind,
don't you cry dry your eye,
We got goals to achieve, it is our destiny,
until we've learned what love truly means,
You gotta set the caged bird free,
that is what you said to me, if it returns it is ours to keep

[Chorus]

I long to hold you once more, babe, just one more time,
before you go I want you to know I'll always be there for you.
The road to your fortune is right behind the door, baby,
I want you to go through and find what you're looking for.

Check it out
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin' money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin' money till the day that I die

Behold the uncontrollable
I keep the hold world in drama
Smoke my competition now they jus a bag of skama
I'm a reload the vocab that Manson used
Amateurs they plead the O.J.
And wonder why they lose
I subdue the microphone and left it in submission
Then cracked the Phillie open 
And found a talent that was hidden
I kid no man whose similar to mental migraine
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game
It's been a long time maybe too long
Since your audio produced a real rap song
I robbed a man who doubt the jack up on the plan
He can stand but didn't analyze the whole pro-jam
I took my time, I found I couldn't wait to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die

The new and improved
You can't make a move
Or elude the feud about to be cued
A soloist journed through tha mist now found
Assassinate the sound wit choke by the pound
Make my own type of home by the phone
MC's reachin for my style, I'll leave alone
My terminology and oddessy on the man
I'll count your rap for sham and move cooler than a fan
Split decision, I cut wit precision
So many tried before
But still couldn't get in
Now it's on..no need to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die
I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die

I'm high till I die so there's no need to lie
Pass that metal over to the small guy
Kickin inside from desire
Mills will be the amps on the mic
Will explode to feel the fire
I'm lifted/up off my wig like terrific
Target every market/move on each one specific
Overload the frame but keep it all the same
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game
Play me and try to get away that's a maybe
Be before and I will hold a 9 to ya lady
I styles like a weapon/I hit the untrue
Don't need for me to come stalkin
And lookin for you
I rip through ya heart and bust through ya veins
I guarantee that things will never ever be the same
I kicked it on the real
Now I keep it on the plane
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya brain
I'm so high

I'm so high/you so high
I be gettin money till the day that I die

Mic Geronimo,"[Verse 1]
Notoriously enterprising, vocals for analyzing
I move, defiant speech more deeper than Poseidon
Give me, the highest esteem like hundreds of cream
Lick a shot off like Spock with them laser beams
Its the, greatest vocabularian in era
My styles vary like leathers, niggas rocking the serum
Living forever 40 ki's couldn't measure to the treasure
from these pedigrees I flow larger than see's
Cristal and Dom-P, getting sexed in the 'telly
 From bitches, who's in the running (how they look?) up with Halle Berry
I'm far from ordinary, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel
Beware from the strength of the Natural

[Verse 2]
Now from below I die trying like a Japanese hero
Lyrics are Kilo's the outcome nothing but cee-lo's
Leave those, unprofessional pros alone
Enjoy the sound that's now emitting out the microphone
I'm every word personified, create astonishing lines
Go inside and pull a paragraph or two from my mind
Then decline the competition and recline inside the vision
Of uncanny type precision, hit 'em in all positions
Let it be known, my apparatus is stone
Inject the hyper tone inside the space between your headphones
I'm naturally grown, but leaving it sewn just like a surgeon
Money I'm splurging, that mean I got to leave it burning (right)
The simple fact, I'm like a Mac when I hit
Reality perceived to me, this ain't no counterfeit shit
Doing my thing-thing, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel
Beware from the strength of the Natural",The Natural
Mic Geronimo,"It's time it's time it's time it's time 
This is time to build  it's time to build 
It's time to build  it's time to build 
It's time to build  this is time to build 

I format my mind for combat 
In fact I put a hole up in your back on the song like that 
Rollin thick with my people ain't no room to breathe 
Surrounded by murderous felons  drinks and bags of weed 
I swing at ya and get fly with the M-I 
I'm automatic trample in your static with the semi 
So when I squeeze I'm off in the breeze with these 
Licking shots at them whack MC's 
With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills 
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build 
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop 
I bigger with my style ain't a bully on your fuckin block 
Word is bond I go on 
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs 
Insane in the brain nothing left to gain 
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, Mother Fuckers 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build

Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name 
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves 
Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that 44 caliber 
Infrared aimed at your jugular 
Who the fuck are you? Nobody cares 
You just be another nigga that needs repairs 
Talking to all them niggas shitting 
And all them faggots that be steady bitching, inside their insides twitching 
Sod sill delivering, DOA push a nine to your mind and commence the spray 
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left 
Scared of life but want to play the game of death 
What's next? Niggas wearing padded kotex 
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex 
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler 
Be easy on the cut, uh, uh, uh 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build

Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fucking next niggas demeanor 
You know my work I bless and press more skirts then the cleaners 
I'm damn relaxed cause you cats can't stress the G 
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me 
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Hienz 
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines 
So flame on I turn my game on the expert 
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network 
Fuck what you niggas kickin on the mic 
You chicken like you don't know what an ass whippin feels like 
I'm living flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks 
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, yeah 
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects 
Niggas get 5,000 shit is rough 
Time to close I hit you with 16 of those 
Next time maybe more, but who the fuck knows? 

This is time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, it's time to build 
It's time to build, this is time to build 

Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo 
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges 
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches 
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy 
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody 
I did too much dirt to turn back now 
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now 
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart but I don't 
To live a carefree life if I stop killing but I won't 
It's in my blood to destroy man kind 
With every murder I lose it little more of my damn mind 
And I ain't got much left to lose nigga ,so don't snooze nigga 
I'm telling yous nigga, just pay your dues nigga 
Respect my mother fucking style of rap 
Murder your mic and your unborn child 
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street 
A little something that can't be beat

Keep wishing upon that same ol' star

Can't say I know what you look like

Yo, I believe I can fly

Master divisor, colder as I grew wiser
Fool the world like Keyser, see they stuck 85ers
With science, move and use complete silence
Niggas are God recognizin that we run earth with iron
I'm here, but I still ain't seen nobody come near
To the heat so severe it leave you scorched from a flare
Bustin two up in the air, then the rest you got
And God forbid these niggas ever make my hustlin stop
When I drop it's only to put it to excellency status
See, we here to run it all with eight other planets
But I'm on till it's gone, understand it
Performin to the warm hugs and slugs and feel the storm kinda tragic
Magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why
I can fly

Everybody want to be like Mic
Everybody want to be like Mic

Yo, I believe I can fly

Lexus and Benzes every color 
Push a Hummer in the butters
Go to Miami in the summer months 
Crush ice Rolly seemed like my brother once
Chillin on my arm, dippin in my pocket
Hold a 40, Benz inside my palms
Duplexes, east and west coast, plus the flats
Everybody know we get it on like that
With assorted firearm bulletproof to match
Teflon ??? my fitting baseball hat
While my ladies carry .380s in front of they snatch
And we makin all this caper but never givin it back
It's amazin how I put it all together with rap
1000s of listeners everywhere that fall on the map
See, it's magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why

Yo, I believe I can fly

Either you down or you isn't in this game for the wins
Stackin the compensates and livin straight for the ends
Hittin skins, luxury Sedans with the rims
Fuckin with Washingtons while i'm holdin on the Benz
Pen's like a lens, so it's clear
Bless you in your dome with the chrome
Bring the flavor to your ear
Appear to make these willies reconsider the fear
Rhymin for nothin these niggas shouldn't try to come near
See, it's magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much

Mic Geronimo,"Yeah
Came to talk to you for a minute
You know
I miss you
But I love you
Ain't nobody done for me what you done for me, Ma
You know
So I'ma do this one here for you

Rest in peace
Your son

It woulda been the greatest thing in the world to see
All the possibilities, you made em real for me
In '73 opened me to life itself
Guard my health and went for delf but needed no one else
Allah himself'll only know the reason you're gone
And forever I'ma feel a little pain and mourn
(Life goes on) Now I'm blessed, so I raise each morn
Still I ask every night you help me face the dawn
Pray alone inside a stone-cold confusion and weep
But only your touch can bring me to peace
I can keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]
	This is cause I'm thinkin of you
	My love for you will always be true
	You know I'll never forget you for life
	Think of you forever

Sittin recallin how you caught me, how you broke my fall
Heard you scream off in terrors, heard my name you called
All of the lessons you taught me, how this life is war
How to hold till I be sure that I can go for more
Saw me enduring the pain and goin from poor to fame
But livin with more to gain is makin me more insane
It's a strain, I could tell you, you already know
Still I'ma live to tellin you so
And I'm sure you know the way that you was handlin was passed to me
Askin nobody for nothin, so don't ask for me
Look and see how you raised a little nigga to man
It was all just a part of the plan
Daze back as I gaze back lookin at the fact that you left
Funny how I keep hearin footsteps
I keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

If I could leave you off with somethin, it would have to be this
You know I'm gettin through these obstacles, you will be missed
Left a kiss on the forehead, hold through a touch
Now I leave that in the streets from rollin up in a dutch
Ask the Lord to bless the soul of a child if He may
I can only hope that we unite and see you one day
And playback after playback, it wasn't fair
But still and all I never say that, remember here
You got a place inside a nigga, where you end, I begin
Till then, let me tell you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

	Do you know I'm thinking of you, Mama
	Don't you know I think about you all the time

[Chorus]

I love you, Mommy

Mic Geronimo,"[Royal Flush Intro]
Word... Things ain't what they used to be out here, man
Ain't no more easy living, no more man
You best to recognize, man, it's a struggle out here, man
We forced to do, what we got to do, to survive
It wasn't nothing like this back in the days, man
Word, shit got to change

Verse 1 [Mic Geronimo]
Increasing murders, Three-strike life servers, burners, informers
Guiliani's crews on us
The heat's just like the guns that we bust shot up
Poisoning the little ones, now they grow corrupt
It's different stages, environment got most vision tainted
Murals on the corner, Rest in Peace now a painting
Haters seeing the dehumanization of a being
But worst of all most of y'all don't know what I'm meaning
And strange days, time seems to move so fast
Only concerns is the cash, and a whip to match
See this life is like a bid but it won't do me 
And it's funny nothings really like it used to be, one, two

[Chorus, with Marvin Gaye singing]
Well things ain't what they used to be
4x

Verse 2 [Mic Geronimo]
The epidemics, narcotics, paramedics
Everybody eager at a party just to wet it
And felonies, armed robberies, and sprees
Higher rates on a key, ghetto love disease
More discreetly you choose, who to fucking trust
Nowadays bulletproof, and a Phills a must
Most of us serving, or peeling the yardage on the charges
Incarcerated cut-off from the world, disregarded
Crack babies retardly born, dis-formed
And fathers known for shooting China-White inside they arm
Desert Sickness, planet Earth at it's illest
Strategically the illest, plan a man in specifics
Life is like a bid, but it won't do me
Mentally these are the things that I should not see
And I'm standing here, counting all the casualties
Cause things ain't nothing really like they used to be, one, two

[Chorus] 4x

Verse 3 [Mic Geronimo]
Like a night sky
saw the darker levels, leading teams of rebels
And steaming these streets, just like kettles
Dime minds can rarely walk the concreate, eroded
Playing, I made a folding, off the cards I was holding
Young, Stand between you, from the phantom, ghetto backs drops a cannon

Still a thug, and some will stay the same, for most of his days
Flushing to South Jamaica raids, saw the time change hands
Caravans go to MP's after that Lex Lands
And it's bugged just the product of

Mic Gillette,"You thought you had found yourself a good girl,
One who would love you and give you the world.
Then you find, babe, that you've been misused,
Come to me, honey, I'll do what you choose.

She'd embarrass you anywhere, 
She'd make her friends think that she didn't care 

Give me the chance and I'd been begging 
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to 

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need 
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything alright

The girl you had didn't have no sense, 
She wasn't worth all the time that you spent 
Had another man throw you out the door, 
Now that same man is wearing your clothes 

I want you to
Tell your Mama, what you want, tell your Mama, what you need 
Tell your Mama, what you got to have",Tell Mama

Micah P. Hinson,"This first time

Something gotta change can't keep running away
And I've been running just as fast as my legs can take me

Shooting for the stars can be a hard task
When remembering all the miles I run oh so fast away
So fast away

Charging up the stairs should get you there
A million seconds before I can get there
Take along the towns and find the words to say 
The things you must have thought a million times anyway

Passing all the hearts and hoping to die
For all our promises turned out to be lies
Pull out the needles and heads from my weary eyes
For all those things I said, weren't all lies
Weren't all lies
Weren't all lies ",The Last Charge of Lt. Paul

And he had moved on none of us care

É come una marea
É un'onda che va
E tutto si ricrea
Se tu saprai
Guardare in fondo al cuore
Un senso d'amore
Tu lo troverai

Se pensi che
Il mondo è cosi grande
E sempre più
Di tutto ci confonde
Che cosa mai
Potrai lasciare in dono
Della tua vita
Di quello che sei

E' tutto qui
Il piccolo segreto
La semplicità
La giola di un minuto
Un figlio saprà
Vedere nel tuo cuore
E quel candore
Lui lo capirà

Avrà per lui
Il gusto di un tesoro
Che non si può
Compare col denaro
Ti chiederai
Se c'è un più bel regalo
Di tutto l'amore
Che gli lascerai

Lango la via
Cammineremo insieme
In armonia
Cercando sempre il bene
Lascia che sia
Nel cerchio della vita

Che vive con noi

E quale incanto vivo io
Solo a veder danzare te

Al dulce beso final
A tu triste adios

She laughed, she cried
And she loved as she breathed

Every moment with Martha
Was filled with her passion for life

I would miss you so much

Goodbye, goodbye, my love
I've lost everything
Goodbye
How will I ever live without you

Michaël,"La noche se apiada de mi
Y me aleja de ti
Y no me hace llorar
Sin ti
Ya no ardo en rencor
Aùn dueles
Pero vuelvo a sonor

Heridas que ya no sangraran
Mudo latir de corazon
Que ya no quire recordar
Que se ha cansado de esperar
Silencio que es mi ùltimo adios

Y sin mirar atras me enfrento al miedo
La lluvia lavo el amanecer
Y el viento borro los besos

Ya no es una obsesion
Solo una sombra, poco mas
Que mi promesa deja mas
Recriminarte tu traicion
Y ahora, desde otro tiempo y lugar
Sin que me ciegue la pasion
Pongo aqui el punto y final
A mi cancion de soledad",La Noche Sin Ti

Is never cold
Embers of summer
And the thought of you

Rain in September
Is never sad

And the thought of you
Lover, sing to me
Hold me as if love
Was finally true

Lover, kiss me
Tell me that love
Is finally true

Sweet secrets and a warm embrace
Will we meet again

Maybe in September
We'll dance once more
We'll dream together
Oh, the thought of you
Meet me in September

Plans are being made for after school
Should you tell them how you're really feelin'
Or go along and play it cool
Well, I know, I know
How it feels, I know, I know

Everybody's talkin', about a good time
Something tells you something isn't right
But when you're lonely and the pressure's on you
It's really hard to stand and fight

There's a candle burning in the wind
And if you can lean upon the Father
You can find the strength within

Well, I know, I know
That you can

Now it seems like everybody's against you
And no one really cares

You don't know who to trust,
You don't know where to turn
Well at least you know you've got a prayer

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Good to those who are good to me

Happy birthday, happy birthday
And they feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad

Michael Angelo,"There's a place where lovers go to cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
You can buy a dream or two to last you all through the years
And the only price you pay is a heartful of tears
 
Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to lonesome town to cry my troubles away
In the town of broken hearts the streets are paved with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town I can learn to forget

No decisions, child's play
Did they slip away?
Gone forever, gone forever
Lost to yesterday

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

As I walk down, streets full of amber leaves
I see nothing's really changed at all
We're just older now
Still together, still together
After all these years

And from the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend
True until the end of time

From the beginning you've been
Always there my old friend

Michael Anthony Natural Instincts Trio,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

Michael Ball,"To dream, the impossible dream
To fight, the unbeatable foe
To bear, with unbearable sorrow
To run, where the brave dare not go

To right, the unrightable wrong
And to love, pure and chaste from afar
To try, when your arms are too weary
To reach, the unreachable star

This is my quest, to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far
And to fight for the right, without question or pause
To be willing to march into Hell, for a heavenly cause

And I know if I'll only be true, to this glorious quest 
That my heart will lie, will lie peaceful and calm 
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars 
Still strove, with his last ounce of courage 
To reach 
The unreachable
The unreachable
The unreachable stars

I'll always dream, the impossible dream
And yes I will reach

For all I've been
Blessed with in this life
There was an
Emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by
The power of gold
With one honest touch
You set me free

Chorus:
Let the world
Stop turning
Let the sun
Stop burning
Let them tell me love's
Not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know
Deep in my heart
The only dream that
Mattered had come true
In this life, I was
Loved by you

For every mountain
I have climbed
And every raging
River crossed
You were the treasure
That I longed to find
Without you love
I would be lost

Chorus

In this life,
I was loved by you

And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever You Are

And if you should lose your path along the way
And find yourself walking in the dark
Whenever the ones you love seem far away

Some are lost and some are lonely
Drifting away but they are only
Reaching out for love to hold on to

Guide them where the healing waters flow

Here they sang about 'tomorrow'

And they rose with voices ringing
I can hear them now
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn!

That I live and you are gone.

Where romantic poets have left their mark
The time of year, the way I feel
I dream of you, the dream is real
I watch the flowers grow
Change their clothes and die
I wonder why
You and I may never be the same again
I always hold you close to my heart
When I'm walking through holland park

Lost in my thoughts again
Disaster's road
Has been walked by better men
In every tree, in every stone
The sound of love walked alone
Oh mighty love you are
A heavy cross to bear
And it's so unfair
You and I may never be the same again
I always hold you close to my heart
When I'm walking through holland park

I won't let me drown my emotions
Even though I'd just as soon forget
The voices made the most of the magic
And the moment
So I just listen to my life and to my breath

In every tree in every stone
The sound of love that walked alone
Oh mighty love, you are a heavy cross to bear
And it's so unfair
You and I may never be the same again

Even when there's nothing there but gloom

Has the strength to dream 
He can redeem his soul and climb 
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question 
Still I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow

While I can stand, while I can walk

Michael Ball,"No man, no madness, 
Though their sad power may prevail, 
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart 
They rise to fail 
She is eternal 
Long before nations' lines were drawn 
When no flags flew, and no armies stood 
My land was born 
And you ask me why I love her 
Through wars, death and despair 
She is the constant 
We who don't care 
And you ask me would I leave her -- but how? 
I cross over borders but I'm still there now 
How can I leave her? 
Where would I start? 
Let men's petty nations tear themselves apart 
My land's only borders lie around my heart

Michael Ball,"Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter. 
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter. 
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade. 
Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to. 
If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you. 
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade. 

I'll march my band out! I'll beat my drum! 
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir.

That sir at least I dindn't make it.

Or a freckle on the nose of life's complexion,

I gotta fly once, I gotta try once. 
Only I can die once. Right, sir? 
Ooh, life is juicy. Juicy and you see 
I gotta have my bite, sir. 

Get ready for me, love, 'cause I'm a comer. 
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer. 
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade. 

I'm gonna live and live now! 
Get what I want, I know how! 
One roll for the whole she'll bang! 
One throw, that bell will go clang! 
Eye on the target and wham! 
One shot, one gun shot and bam! 

Hey, everybody, here I am!

Michael Ball,"I dreamed a dream in times gone by 
When hope was high 
And life worth living 
I dreamed that love would never die 
I dreamed that God would be forgiving 

Then I was young and unafraid 
And dreams were made and used and wasted 
There was no ransom to be paid 
No song unsung 
No wine untasted 

But the tigers come at night 
With their voices soft as thunder 
As they tear your hope apart 
And they turn your dream to shame 
 
He slept a summer by my side 
He filled my days with endless wonder 
He took my childhood in his stride 
But he was gone when autumn came 

And still I dream he'll come to me 
That we will live the years together 
But there are dreams that cannot be 
And there are storms we cannot weather 

I had a dream my life would be 
So different from this hell I'm living 
So different now from what it seemed 
Now life has killed 
The dream I dreamed.",I Dreamed a Dream [From Les Miserables]
Michael Ball,"In a place that won't let us feel
In a life where nothing seems real
I have found you
I have found you
In a world that's moving too fast
In a world where nothing can last
I will hold you
I will hold you

Our lives will change when tomorrow comes
Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums
And we have music all right
Tearing the night

A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound, a lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me
To hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

On the other side of the earth
There's a place where life still has worth
I will take you
I'll go with you
You won't believe all the things you'll see
I know 'cause you'll see them all with me

If we're together that's when
We'll hear it again

A song
Played on a solo saxophone
A crazy sound, a lonely sound
A cry that tells us love goes on and on
Played on a solo saxophone
It's telling me
To hold you tight
And dance like it's the last night of the world

Dreams
They were all I ever knew
Dreams
You won't need when I'm through
Anywhere
We may be
I will sing with you

So stay with me
And hold me tight
And dance

The coffee cup, I think about you.

The morning ends, I think about you. 
I talk to friends and think about you. 
And do they know 
it's like I'm losing my mind. 
All afternoon doing every little chore 
The thought of you stays bright 
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor 
Not going left, not going right. 
I dim the lights and think about you 
Spend sleepless nights to think about you 
You said you loved me 
or were you just being kind? 
or am I losing my mind? 
I want you so...

Michael Ball,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the the lamp light the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory,all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time i knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every steet lamp seems to beat a fatalistic warning
someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
and soon it will be morning
Day light, i mustwait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin
burnt out ends of a smokey days
the stale cold smell of morning
the street lamp dies, 
another night is over
another day is dawning

it's so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory 
of my days in the sun
IF you touch me you'll understand what happiness is
look, a new day has begun

There's something due any day
I will know right away soon as it shows
It may come cannonballing down though the sky
Gleam in its eye bright as a rose

Under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due

Something's coming I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great

Something's coming, don't know well
But it's soon catch the moon, one handed catch

Around the corner or whistling down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be? Yes, it will maybe just by holding still
It'll be there

Come on, something, come on in, don't be shy
Meet a guy, pull up a chair

Just let you leave without a trace?

And even shared the tears

Michael Ball,"Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!

Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace

",Silent Night
Michael Ball,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up way up high
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born

A silent wish sails the seven seas
The winds have changed, whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt crumbled, tossed and torn
This comes to past when a child is born

A rosy hue settles all around
You've got to feel, you're on solid ground
And for a spell or two no one seems forlorn
This comes to pass when a child is born

And all of this happens because the world is waiting
Waiting for one child, black, white, yellow, no one knows
But a child who would grow up and turn tears to laughter
Hate to love, war to peace, everyone to everyone's neighbor
Misery and suffering will be words to be forgotten forever

It's all a dream and illusion now
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow, somehow
All across the land dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass when a child is born
This comes to pass when a child is born
",When a Child Is Born
Michael Ball,"The nights are colder now 
Maybe I should close the door 
And anyway the snow has covered all your footsteps 
And I can follow you no more 
The fire still burns at night 
My memories are warm and clear 
But everybody knows It's hard to be alone at this time of year 
It was only a winter's tale 
Just another winter's tale 
And why should the world take notice 
Of one more love that's failed 
(It's)a love that can never be 
Though we meant to love to 
You and me 
On a worldwide scale 
We're just another winter's tale 
Why I stand alone 
A bell is ringing far away I wonder if you hear 
I wonder if you listening 
I wonder where you are today 
Good luck, I wish you well 
For all that wishes may be worth 
I hope that love and strength 
are with you for the length of your time on earth",A Winter's Tale
Michael Ball,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
Coming to the edge, running on the water
Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters

Sing the greatest song
Stand on a star
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the darkening dawn

Oh, it's asking for the taking
Come run with me now
The sky is the color of blue
You've never ever seen
In the the eyes of your lover

Coming to the edge, running on the water
Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters

Oh what a circus, oh what a show, Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
They've all gone crazy, mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over themselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron

It's quite a sunset and good
For the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front pages
Of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, Eva Peron

But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love

I lie awake and watch her sleeping

So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark

If I never wake up in the morning

About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed

To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

Michael Ball,"I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a damm had broken in my heart

After taking every detour
Getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I've forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rolling through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are

But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when

My search for gold is leading nowhere
Whichever lonely road I take it seems to go where

How can I display
What I know I'm worthy of
When they turn me away. 

The doors are closed to such as I
A Boy from Nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
There'll be men with respect not humiliation 

A man's place on earth
I have come to realise is decided by birth. 

So what's the future?
No matter where I go
I will still belong
In Andalusia 
Where we don't know where the next penny's coming from -
Something's wrong 

I vow to Spain, I won't remain a Boy from Nowhere
There has to be a place for me and I must go where 

I don't fantasise, like a million others
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight for the need to survive 

So what's the future?
No matter where I go, I will still belong
In Andalusia 
The good honest men grow weak and the rich grow strong
Something's wrong 

Another dawn, another morn
A Boy from Nowhere
My destiny will guarantee that I must go where
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow

And the way things are round here
That's the last thing they need

Michael Ball,"There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

Can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far

Can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
And there's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

Can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far, oh

Can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest, oh
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Can you feel the love tonight?
Can you feel the love tonight?
Oh, can you feel the love tonight?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yeah, yeah

Oh, it is where we are
It's where we are

Michael Ball,"So this is who I am and this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow

And I will stand
For my dream if I can
A symbol of my faith in who I am
But I am so lonely

And I must follow on
The road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
I am so lonely

And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

Cause I have found a dream
That must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But I am so lonely

I'm sorry I don't have a role
For love to play
Hand over my heart, I'll find the way
I will make them give to me

Michael Ball,"Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness wakes
And stirs imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I compose the music of the night 

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes 
And embelish on your darkest dreams,
Purge all thoughts of the life you knew before,
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live like you've never lived before

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night 

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world,
leave all thoughts of the world you knew before,
let your soul take you where you long to be,
only then can you belong to me. 

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night 

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night

Don't write a letter when you want to leave. 
Don't call me at 3 A.M. from a friend's apartment. 
I'd like to choose how I hear the news. 
Take me to a park that's covered with trees. 
Tell me on a Sunday please. 

Let me down easy, no big song and dance. 
No long faces, no long looks, no deep conversation. 
I know the way we should spend the day. 
Take me to a zoo that's got chimpanzees. 
Tell me on a Sunday please. 

Don't want to know who's to blame, 
it won't help knowing. 
Don't want to fight day and night

Don't leave in silence with no word at all.

Michael Ball,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All [From Mamma Mia]

When the moon was just right 
Something good was gonna happen 
I could feel it inside 
That's when I saw her 
At a club called 'Simply Blues' 
And the way that we connected 
Should have made front page news 

She had an electric smile 
And an air of confidence 
Why she was there alone 
Didn't make no sense 
I said, 'Let's get out of here 
Hey, ain't you tired of this?' 
She said, 'Well, you put it like that
How could I resist?' 

[Chorus:]
She was a beautiful, beautiful heartache 
Beautiful chance I had to take 
She was a beautiful, beautiful heartache 
It hurt so good... 
I'd gladly make the same mistake 

It didn't take long till I was over my head 
So many promises were made 
So many things got said 
I loved her and I thought that she loved me 
But some things in this world 
Well, they just ain't meant to be 

[Chorus:]

No regrets, no tears, no feeling sorry now 
That's just a door that had to close 
I knew going in that it might not work out 
That's just the way the story
That's just the way the story goes

It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed.

It is a hunger, an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
And you it's only seed.
It's the heart, afraid of breaking,
That never learns to dance.
It's the dream, afraid of waking,
That never takes a chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
Who cannot seem to give.
And the soul, afraid of dying,
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely,
And the road has been to long,
And you think that love is only for

Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose.",The Rose

When the night is cold
And you need someone to hold
Ill be there for you - if ever you call

When you need to know the truth
I will whisper I love you
And be there for you - if you call
If you feel the rain
And everyone feels the rain - sometimes
Remember to call my name
And Ill be there

But it sounds like the signal's gone 

Thoughts of you rush into my head 
They tease me for a moment or two 
Trying to fill the hours ahead 
Until I'm beside you 

Leave a light on, leave a light on 
Help me find my way back into your arms 
Leave a light on, soon I will be there 
Keep it shining and I'll be along 
There's just one place in this world where I belong 
And I'll keep right on driving till I get home 
So leave a light on 

I can almost see you there 
Like a dream with your hair falling down 
The room is filled with whispers of love 
Could there ever be a sweeter sound 

Underneath the cover of night 
I feel your body so close to mine 
(And we'll be) On our way to heaven again 
And make up for lost time 

Leave a light on, leave a light on 
Help me find my way back into your arms 
Leave a light on, till you see me there

How strong the power of love can be
Sometimes you just take my breath away
You watch my love grow like a child
Sometimes gentle and sometimes wild

It's too good to lose
It's too good to be there
Just to use
I'm gonna stand on a mountain top
And tell the news
That you take my breath away
Your beauty is there in all I see
And when I feel your eyes on me
Don't you know you just take my breath away
Say my life is yours, my heart will be
Singing for you eternally

Michael Ball,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un'elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte 
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvisso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette d'affogare

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono i pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene, sai
È una cantena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai 

Te voglio bene assai

Though their sad power may prevail, 
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart

She is eternal 
Long before nations' lines were drawn 
When no flags flew, and no armies stood 
My land was born 
 
And you ask me why I love her 
Through wars, death and despair 
She is the constant 
We who don't care 
And you ask me would I leave her -- but how?

How can I leave her?

Not a sound from the pavement 
Has the moon lost her memory? 
She is smiling alone 

In the lamplight 
Withered leaves collected at my feet 
And the wind begins to blow

All alone in the moonlight 
I can smile at the old days 
I was beautiful then 
I remember 
The time I knew what happiness was 
Let the memory live again 

Every street lamp 
Seems to beat 
A fatalistic warning 
Someone mutters 
And the street lamp gutters 
And soon 
It will be morning 
 
Daylight, 
I must wait for the sunrise 
I must think of a new life 
And I mustn't give in 
When the dawn comes 
Tonight will be a memory too 
And a new day will begin 

Burnt out ends of smoky days 
The stale cold smell of morning 
The streetlamp dies, 
Another night is over 
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory 
Of my days in the sun 
If you touch me 
You'll understand what happiness is

Is a step along the way

Draw back in fear

I could stay lost in this moment forever 
Every moment spent with you 
Is a moment I treasure 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Laying close to you 
Feeling your heart beating 
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming 
Wondering if it's me you're seeing 
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together 
I just wanna stay with you 
In this moment forever, forever and ever 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

I don't wanna miss one smile 
I don't wanna miss one kiss 
I just wanna be with you 
Right here with you, just like this 
I just wanna hold you close 
Feel your heart so close to mine 
And just stay here in this moment 
For all the rest of time 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
'Cause I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep 
'Cause I'd miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 
'Cause even when I dream of you 
The sweetest dream would never do 
I'd still miss you, baby 
And I don't wanna miss a thing 

Don't wanna close my eyes 
Don't wanna fall asleep, yeah 
I don't wanna miss a thing

Michael Ball,"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's going as she's leaving
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool

My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile has been disguised
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes",Lyin' Eyes
Michael Ball,"Just One Voice, 
Singing in the darkness, 
All it takes is One Voice, 
Singing so they hear what's on your mind, 
And when you look around you'll find 
There's more than 

One Voice, 
Singing in the darkness, 
Joining with your One Voice, 
Each and every note another octave, 
Hands are joined and fears unlocked, 
If only 

One Voice 
Would start it on its own, 
We need just One Voice facing the unknown, 
And then that One Voice would never be alone, 
It takes that One Voice. 

It takes that One Voice. 

Just One Voice 
Singing in the darkness, 
All it takes is One Voice, 
Shout it out and let it ring. 

Just One Voice, 
It takes that One Voice, 
And everyone will sing!",One Voice
Michael Ball,"The sun comes up, I think about you. 
The coffee cup, I think about you. 
I want you so 
It's like I'm losing my mind. 

The morning ends, I think about you. 
I talk to friends and think about you. 
And do they know 
It's like I'm losing my mind. 
 
All afternoon doing every little chore 
The thought of you stays bright 
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor 
Not going left, not going right. 
I dim the lights and think about you 
Spend sleepless nights to think about you 
You said you loved me 
Or were you just being kind? 
Or am I losing my mind? 

I want you so...

Michael Ball,"Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Michael Ball,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City

Michael Ball,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",Winner Takes it All
Michael Ball,"Sleep like a baby 
My little lady
Dream tell the sunrise
Creeps into your eyes, dream tell the sunrise turns on the day

In the avenues and alleyways
While you sleep there's a whole world comin alive
Abel and his brother fight with one another
In and out of every dive
The avenues and alleyways
Where the strong and the quick alone can survive
Look around the jungle 
See the rough and tumble
Listen to a squealer cry
Then a little later in the morning paper
Read about the way he died

Wake up my pretty
Go to the city
Stay through the daytime
Safe in the sunshine 
Stay till the daytime turns into night

In the avenues and alleyways
Where a man's gotta work out which side he's on
Anyway he chooses 
Chances are he looses
No one gets to live too long

The avenues and alleyways
Where the soul of a man is easy to buy
Everybody's wheelin'
Everybody's dealin'
All the low and living hyde
Every city's got 'em can we ever stop em
Some of us
Have gotta try",Avenues and Alleyways [*]
