The Rodeo,"A magic wand
Now in your hand
Time to make a change
How can I teach you?
A better way to do
Something you won’t do
Up high in the sky
With butterflies
The setting is so nice
Add more colour
Make the world wilder
‘Cause I feel bored and sad

I’m a dreamer every night
In your shadow, here’s the light
Here’s a place I want to be

And see the world through your eyes

Dazzled by the sun
My feet won’t burn
It’s warmer in my heart
In your kingdom
The trees in blossom
The branches are my arms
A thrilling feeling
I try to explain
My mouth is dry

I’m a dreamer every night
In your shadow, here’s the light
Here’s a place I want to be
So crazy and unique

And see the world through your eyes

Turn the sandglass round
It’s time to fall in love
Turn the sandglass round",Here's the Light
The Rodeo,"I live in a ditch with my friends and enemies
We’ve thrown all the thorns to dry my inspiration up
I have no more words, I have no more patience
I have only sounds that hardly come from my mouth
My skull is like a cracked ballot box

But when the darkest night’ll come to us
The light won’t shine it will make me nervous
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)
We’re not even deaf but I scream to stay out of this nightmare
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)

I live in a ditch where too much waste piles up
Where my fallen dreams are more important than your talk
I’m a zombie for myself but for you I’m still a baby
My mind is half empty what the hell am I gonna do?
My skull is like a cracked ballot box

But when the darkest night’ll come to us
The light won’t shine it will make me nervous
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)
We’re not even deaf but I scream to stay out of this nightmare
And who’s gonna hear your message on the radio
(Radio, I’m on the radio)",On the Radio
The Rodeo,"Love’s a bird, a hard creature to tame
When its large wings sweep your door in vain
The weight of love is heavier than it seems
But, unexpected, it looks like a dream

And the wind blows through the mountains
Icarus was not insane
All the forsaken souls sing their hard times in chorus 
But you went away

One fine day the feathers fell off one by one
Now the animal looks nothing like a swan
You can hardly speak you’re not so strong
Time to put your own bird in a cage for so long",Bird
The Rodeo,"You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows

Move both hands very slowly across the screen
A silhouette appears suddenly through the beam
Your fingers are the most nimble I’ve ever seen

The light is too faint
To see your face
But I can feel
That you’re out of breathe

You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows

Make two baby birds or a woodpecker
An elephant or a snake
Make an Old King Cole or a clown
An Old Mother Hubbard and her dog

You wished the Earth would swallow you up
To live under the stars above
Underground with beautiful shapes
Hand shadows",Hand Shadows
The Rodeo,"High, high, resolution world
No flaws, no mistakes, nothing blurred,
Connected to the computer
What are we gonna do?
Not found, a message error on the screen and then you hung around
Beyond us there’s a wall of sound
Baby don’t you know
I’m good inside
You know I’m feeling good inside
Good, good, inside

I know you can’t
You can’t direct my hand
You can’t control my joy or my pain

Now, enter the word “alive”
My heart’s compressed in a desperate file
Let’s erase the codes we apply
What are we gonna do?
True, it’s true and funny how things you escape from and think about
Are maybe the links to our lives?

I know you can’t
You can’t direct my hand
You can’t control my joy or my pain",High Resolution World
The Rodeo,"I’m on my way to tell the end
The end but not a happy end
My mouth is full of razorblades
But I keep thinking of the past

I should have said
Everything’s gonna be ok
The tape is on
Recording all the words that come

‘Cause I’m gonna leave you
You know how much I care for you

I don’t know why I slow down my step
Maybe I know but I’m afraid
You’re really like the first day we met
I shouldn’t have any regrets

I should have known
The tears come, easy come
I should have said
Everything’s gonna be ok

‘Cause I’m gonna leave you
You know how much I care for you
For you",I'm Gonna Leave You
The Rodeo,"I’ve been wandering like no one my whole life
Leaving all my partners, what a big surprise!
But maybe one day, someone’ll make me stay

But I’m still loving, that kind of living
If you don’t respect it, run!
...
You’d better know where I come from!

Sometimes I keep on cheating like a child
When my mom spanked me, I never cried
The more we deprive me of  love, the more I’m wild! 

But I’m still loving, that kind of living
If you don’t respect it, run!
...
Or you won’t even notice when I am gone

I was dreaming about an army
Where I will be, lonely

If I’m just a little soldier
With no armour
What should I be?

Authority is part of me, 
It will lead me
To the next story",Little Soldier
The Rodeo,"I remember this pier where we were
Walking like two lonesome friends
The sky was our trophy
A beautiful dream
As far as the eye can see
You told me in a low voice:
“Heads or tails”, 
“Tails” we can get away from it all

But I can’t get out
Of my modern life

Listening to the ocean
Curled up in your arms
I didn’t expect that much
I was not in the mood
For being back for good
You told me in a low voice:
“Why can’t you see, we could get away from it all”

But I can’t get out
Of my modern life",Modern Life
The Rodeo,"I need a friend who well understands
All these ghosts in me that haunt my memories
Oh my God
I saw you there just sitting next to me
-
I need your hand to forget my pain
All these clouds I see
Draft proof my memories
I thought you here from behind, so real
But it was someone else

All the angels are gone
From your back all in one
To a place where all began
Like a baby in your mother’s womb

I need two hours to swallow my saliva
‘cause I’ve licked the ground where they buried you
And I will keep a dirty taste of your last days in my mouth

I need a cello to soften my song
‘cause I cry inside cause’ death is sometimes wrong
Oh my God I’ll think of you
Here’s my ode to you

All the angels are gone
From your back all in one
To a place where all began
Like a baby in your mother’s womb",My Ode To You
The Rodeo,"I’ve got nothing planned
No road maps in my hand
But can you give me a ride?

Man you drive me nuts
I need Mom’s whiskey in my throat
To forget who I was

‘Cause now, I’ve packed all my bags
And if you still try to make me see reason it’s no use
‘Cause now I’ve made up my mind
To get away from it all

I’m a little child
When everything goes awry
I’m sick and tired of playing

I think I’ve lost my bearings
Being nowhere is harder than it seems
You know I’m passing through

No need to keep me, I’m in a hurry now

‘Cause now, I’ve packed all my bags
And if you still try to make me see reason it’s no use
‘Cause now I’ve made up my mind
To get away from it all",Passing Through
The Rodeo,"Uncle Sam
Where have you been?
Take me in your arms
‘Cause I’m getting cold in my eastern city

You look dirty
But look crazy
Your beard is so long
I don’t wonder that the world seems strange to you

You’re paranoid
And fanatic
But you’re lovable
Uncle Sam, I would have grown up on your land

Come along with me
Enjoy what I see
It’s not fantasy
Just reality
‘Cause I’m watching the world like a little girl

Uncle Sam
Polish your boots
And put your hat on
You will find out how to get me a new home

I eat your junk food
It smells so good
I must say I’m full
I will fulfil my empty nights instead

A hero
Someone I know
That everybody knows
But we’d rather sing than watch you on TV

Come along with me

It’s not fantasy
Just reality

Sai che quanta strada tu farai,
Non potrai andare mai abbastanza lontano,
Tu sentirai ogni giorno qualcuno
Che ti chiama

If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse""

And I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
A man, and he looked pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
And I sung my song to my friend Jimmy
And he said one word to me honey, and that was 'Dead'

I saw a guy in the corner, bumming all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out: ""Hey!""

""Eh! By any chance, are you goin' my way?""

You're gonna be the first to go!
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back at nothin'

And he said: ""when you get to that red light
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""
He said: ""Now, I want you to park up in that alley
Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there

The Rolling Stones,"She confessed her love
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor

Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on mercer street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens and Manhattan
And The Bronx and Staten Island
I can’t forget New Jersey and Long Island
And all over the world, we came to rock for everybody like this

Anybody seen, anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out, I reach out and touch the prize

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes 
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes 

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black 
With flowers and my love both never to come back 
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away 
Like a new born baby it just happens every day 

I look inside myself and see my heart is black 
I see my red door and it has been painted black 
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts 
It's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks
And every time they heard the locomotive roar
They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door

Howling bye bye bye bye
Now bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode",Bye Bye Johnny
The Rolling Stones,"The wind blows, rain into my face
The sun glows at the end of the highway
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes
Oh, child of the moon
Give me a wide-awake crescent-shaped smile

She shivers, by the light she is hidden
She flickers like a lamp lady vision
Child of the moon, rub your rainy eyes
Child of the moon
Give me a wide-awake crescent-shaped smile

The first car on the foggy road riding
The last star for my lady is pining
Oh, child of the moon, bid the sun arise
Oh, child of the moon
Give me a misty day, pearly gray, silver, silky faced
Wide-awake crescent-shaped smile",Child of the Moon

The Rolling Stones,"Went to the fortune teller
Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

When she took a look at my palm
She said son are you feeling kinda warm?
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said you're in love

I said I could not be so
I'm not passionate with the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me lies

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she made a fool out of me

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well, I am married to the fortune teller
Well happy as me can be
Now I get my fortune told for free

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well, I am married to the fortune teller
Well happy as me can be

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing
I say, ""Hi, it's me. Who is there on the line?""
A voice says, ""Hi, hello, how are you?""
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
He says, ""It's three a.m., there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good,
Do you have to drive me out of my head ?""

I says, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
And decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out, I was so tired
And I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just - like a flag stuck on my window screen

I says, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Hey! You! Get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby

The Rolling Stones,"I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield
Listening to Gospel music on the colored radio station
And the preacher said, ""You know you always have the
Lord by your side""

And I was so pleased to be informed of this
That I ran twenty red lights in his honor
Thank you Jesus
Thank you Lord

I had an arrangement to meet a girl
And I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there, she'd be off
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find

Much to my surprise
There she was sittin' in the corner
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes

So if you're down on your luck
And you can't harmonize
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
Well

Well the preacher kept right on saying that
All I had to do was send
Ten dollars to the Church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart of Jesus
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California

And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got

So if you're down on your luck
I know you all sympathize
Find a girl with far away eyes

It had creases as sharp as a knife
I put the ring in my pocket
But there was a note
And my heart it jumped into my mouth

It read, ""Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.
But I have no courage to speak to your face.
But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou
There be no wedding today.""

So help me, please doctor, I'm damaged
You can put back my heart in its hole
Oh mama, I'm cryin'
Tears of relief
And my pulse is now under control",Dear Doctor

And the chauffeur drives your car

Your mother she's an heiress, owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
But don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Your old man took her diamond's and tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So don't play with me, 'cause you're playing with fire

Now you've got some diamonds and you will have some others

Ride around in limousines
We looked so fine, baby

I get so scared
Just to see you on the street
They're living dead
You're all the same, you never speak
You're wrecked out now
Washed-up high up on the beach

TV is just a blank
Looks like another dead end Sunday

What about an early night
Monday never feels so bright
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely

Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne?
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by

And she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot, as I wiped her brow
She was hot, she pinned me to the ground
She was quick, she knew her way around
She was hot, as she tore my clothes
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky grey
Nothing like the good old days
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting

I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound just like lightning

And she was hot, in a 50's dress
She was hot, her lips were flashing red
I was lost, in her burning flesh
I was hot, I was dripping sweat
She was hot, in the Detroit snow
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

And she was hot, and I had the blues
She was hot, honey, where were you?
If you were in my shoes
You would be excused

She was hot, you could never wait
She was hot, never hesitate
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails
I was taking passion where you find it

Honey when you're young and fresh
And you need the touch of flesh
Go take the treasure where you find it

And she was hot, in the melted snow
She was hot, in the molten glow
She was hot, she got it in the blood
She was hot, like the dam that bursts
She was strong, she was strong and true
She was black, and her eyes were blue
She was lost, and she took a chance
At just a brief romance

Down the avenue into the lost bayou
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again
In a cold Chicago night

TV is just a blank
Looks like another dead end Sunday

What about an early night?
Monday never feels so bright
Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely

Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne?
Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by

And she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot, as I wiped her brow
She was hot, she pinned me to the ground
She was quick, she knew her way around
She was hot, as she tore my clothes
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky gray
Nothing like the good old days
Well I got a fever that I'm fighting

I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound just like lightning

And she was hot, in a 50's dress
She was hot, her lips were flashing red
I was lost, in her burning flesh
I was hot, I was dripping sweat
She was hot, in the Detroit snow
She was hot, she had no place to go
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

And she was hot, and I had the blues
She was hot, honey, where were you?
If you were in my shoes
You would be excused
She was hot, you can never wait
She was hot, never hesitate
She was hot, on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails
I was taking passion where you find it

Honey when you were young and fresh
And you need the touch of your flesh
Go take the treasure where you find it

And she was hot, in the melted snow
She was hot, in the molten glow
She was hot, she got it in the blood
She was hot, like the dam that bursts
She was black, she was strong and true
She was black, and her eyes were blue
She was lost, and she took a chance
At just a brief romance

Down the avenue into the lost bayou
Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo
I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again
In a cold Chicago night

Pay for it, bust your ass
Lie for it, cheat for it
Forget about your past

You get a rise from it
Feel the hot cum
Dripping on your thighs from it
Why, why so divine, the pain of love

Women will die for it
Looking back, cut the crap
Was it really worth the rap?
It's hard to survive, the pain of love

Ooh, I need a time out
Time to make my mind up
Substitute a line out
I'll be back next season with a bang

No parole, no bail

Hard labor, money splashes

Who had a girlfriend in Paris
He, he had to date her for six months
And eventually she said yes

You know, he took her to his apartment
Cut off her head, put the rest of her body
In the refrigerator, ate her piece by piece
Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the freezer

And when he ate her he took her bones
To the Bois de Boulogne
By chance, a taxi driver noticed him
Burying the bones, you don't believe me?
Truth is stranger than fiction
We drive through there everyday

Horrible, wasn't it?
You know people ask me, ""Is it really true
You know where you live in Texas
Is that really true what they do around there, people?""

I say, ""Hey, now everytime I drive through the crossroads
I get scared there's a bloke running around
With a fuckin' chain saw
Oh, no, he's gotta cut off me
Oh no no! Don't saw off me leg, don't saw off me arm""

I prefer to rot 
I don't want to pop 

I think I'll head back to the jungle, alright 
Don't want to see no big bad rumble, too fright 
Back to zero, that's where we're going 
Back to nothing, right now, right now 
No heroes? No more heroes 
Back to meltdown 
That's where I'm going, back to zero 

My whole life is hanging on a thread 
I'm the fly inside the spider's web 
I'm looking to the future 
I keep on glancing back 
I prefer to rot 
I don't want to pop 

I worry about my great grandchildren 
Living ten miles beneath the ground 
I worry about their whole existence 
The whole damn thing's in doubt 
Back to zero, that's where we're going 
Back to nothing, that's where we're heading

And the earth bursts with the terrible life 
And the sun splash on the windows

I remembered the things that I'd seen
I could still hear the things you said

It was a sad day, bad day

So I called you on the phone
And your friend said, ""She's not home""
So I told her where I'd be at
And that you should call me back

Then I looked at the morning mail
I was not even expecting a bill
Your letter a-started, ""Dear""
And it left me with these tears

But we patched them up somehow
Think of the times I tried to go

Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Tryin' to find somebody to take away these blues
""She don't love me"" hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done 

Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin? two miles about 

Everybody's scrambling, running around
Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down
Foreman wants to panic, ?bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on

On a hot and dusty night?
We were eating eggs in Sammy's
When the black man there drew his knife

Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton
As he washed his sleeveless shirt
You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen
The one we all called Kurt

Come now, gentleman
I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming
Now you fixed your business straight

I remember you in Hemlock Road
In nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy
With a smaller piece of stick

You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man
Your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organs working perfectly
But there's a part that's not screwed on

Weren't you at the Coke convention
Back on nineteen sixty-five
You're the misbred, gray executive
I've seen heavily advertised

You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks
Policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats behind the man
Who works the soft machine

Come now, gentleman
Your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing
Laughing in my grave

When the old men do the fighting
And the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mothers meat
From tubes of plasticon

Be wary of these my gentle friends
Of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit
They eat the hands that bleed

So remember who you say you are
And keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys
So be strong with your beast

Oh Rosie dear, don'tcha think it's queer
So stop me if you please
The baby is dead, my lady said
""You gentlemen, why you all work for me?""

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver

Please take a sweet
Come take a walk with me
We'll sort it out
Back at my place, maybe

It'll come right
You ain't no fool, I ain't either
So why not be nice to an old engine driver?
Better be nice to an old engine driver

I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap

The Rolling Stones,"He walks along singing his fairy song
Picking up magic that grows at his feet.
She says the same her peculiar way
Dreaming good fortune on everyone's street.
Say, hey, have you heard, blue whiskey's the rage,
I'll send you a jug in the morning.

It is absurd to live in a cage,
You know there's got to be something better.
As they go by, don't look with eagle's eyes
Smile on your jailers until they grow weak.
Nothing can compare to something that's almost there
To tear up the madness that all of us seek.

Gonna give away my car.

But you would not go so far.
Don't see what I do not want to see,
You don't hear what I don't say.
Won't be what I don't want to be,
I continue in my way.

Don't see, see, see where I'm goin',
Don't see, see, see where I'm goin',
Don't see, see, see where I'm goin' to,
I don't want to.

You say poverty is picturesque 
As you dragged your nails across my chest

When all our friends
Were wavering
We kept on trying

Now we're always suffering

Remember when
On summer days
I would sing a lovers son
How you would smile
Shower me with praise
And the sun shined on

And the nights grow long
And the train
Cries out so hauntingly
She is gone

Now we're always suffering
Already lost

Please take these flowers
Smell the perfume
Let your soul come alive
Let there be hope
Hope in your heart
That our love may revive

For life is but a chance

And the seeds of love
Are swirling above
Let them be still

Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

Then I realize
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd

I was flippin' magazines
In that place on mercer street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good

Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen her around

We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens and Manhattan
And The Bronx and Staten Island
I can’t forget New Jersey and Long Island
And all over the world, we came to rock for everybody like this

Anybody seen, anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out, I reach out and touch the prize

I saw a guy in the corner, bumming all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out: ""Hey!""
I slowed down to see what he said, he said:
""Eh! By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said: ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""

This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
It shoots tombstone bullets an' a ball and chain!""
He said: ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know
If the cops start to crowding me in
You're gonna be the first to go!
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back at nothin'

And he said: ""when you get to that red light
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""
He said: ""Now, I want you to park up in that alley
Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""
That's what he told me
He said:""keep your foot on the gas
And always be on guard
''cause when I come runnin' out the liquor store with all that money
He wanted me to mash on it real hard
He said: ""Now don't you come out of there an' try me a double-crossed

And said ""Oh there you are!""
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car!
When they put the handcuffs on him
I said: ""Child, your crime must have outgrew him!""

Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode 

Well she remember taking money out from gathering crops
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he could play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss

Bye bye Johnny bye bye Johnny B Goode 

Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks

It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard 
Everyone said, ""What a perfect love match 
'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch"" 

I was drinking in love, gulping it down 
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud 
But after awhile I stopped to rebel 
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 

We'd been living together for over a year 
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear 
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray 
The little things big, that's what they say 

I acted impatient, I acted unkind 
I took her for granted, I played with her mind 
She didn't deserve it but it was too late 
I walked out the door and left her to her fate 

But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life 
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life

Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone 
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone 
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch 
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch 

But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised 
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights

The Rolling Stones,"I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield 
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station 
And the preacher said, ""You know you always have the Lord by your side"" 
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran 
Twenty red lights in his honor 
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord 

I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late 
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off 
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find 
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin' in the corner 
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear 
Was a girl with far away eyes 

So if you're down on your luck 
And you can't harmonize 
Find a girl with far away eyes
And if you're downright disgusted 
And life ain't worth a dime 
Get a girl with far away eyes 

Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send 
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus 
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California 
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio 
And all my dreams would come true 
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl 
Well, you know what kind of eyes she got, well I'll tell ya 

So if you're down on your luck 
I know you all sympathize 
Find a girl with far away eyes

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

I saw a guy in the corner, bumming all alone
As I passed him by, I heard him holler out: ""Hey!""
I slowed down to see what he said, he said:
""Eh! By any chance, are you goin' my way?""
I said: ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""

And that was the moment I regret
Well now boy ""Reach for the sky!""
Because I don't understand, sir
""Don't you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand!""

An' then he said: ""You see this rock I got in my hand?
This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
It shoots tombstone bullets an' a ball and chain!""
He said: ""I ain't tryin' to shake you up, but I just want you to know
If the cops start to crowding me in
You're gonna be the first to go!
You just drive on just like there ain't nothin' happenin'""
That's what he told me, he wouldn't even let me look back at nothin'

And he said: ""when you get to that red light
I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""
He said: ""Now, I want you to park up in that alley
Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store
And keep a sharp lookout at all times
While I sneak in that back door""
That's what he told me
He said:""keep your foot on the gas
And always be on guard
''cause when I come runnin' out the liquor store with all that money
He wanted me to mash on it real hard

And said ""Oh there you are!""
He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car!
When they put the handcuffs on him
I said: ""Child, your crime must have outgrew him!""

The Rolling Stones,"I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

When all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you, don't get what you paid for
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors
What's that funky noise
Guess that's the tightening of the screws
Sitting in the dirt
I'm feeling kind of hurt


All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go boom boom boom
And through the night your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah
Baby won't you dance with me
Ah yeah

Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking
Ar the garbage dumb
I'm running out of water
So I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober
But I end up drunk

We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Kinda makes your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
Yeah

But all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the night your face I see
Baby take your chance
Won't you dance with me
Yeah, come on

The Roomates,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe it
But, God, I know you have your reasons

They said, ""he's busy; hold the line, please""
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead? Show me a sign, please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we Siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults, and robberies
Cops yellin', ""stop, freeze,"" shoot him before he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we runnin' out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these
Hands, I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checkin' for the new award nominee
Wars and atrocities; look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market topplin'
Mad marijuana, Oxycontin, and Klonopin
Everybody out of it?

Well, I've been thinkin' about
And I've been breakin' it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if you're lost and around
Why do we suffer?
Why do we suffer?
(Uh huh)

Yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look at how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings, and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm trying to do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is livin' life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Uh, remix, rising up out of the flames like a Phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds; let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it, I mean it; I did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it, or bleed it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk delete it
I blast off then lay 'em out like a Tempur-Pedic
It's Black Thought; for certain I'm a win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under-appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated, I'm one of the most hated
Something that's so sacred; nobody gon' take it
Face it, I keep doin' it well
Doin' it sans assistance is do it yourself
Doin' it below the radar, we doin' it stealth
Doin' it again for Illadelph; yo, who else?
We gon' do it again

[Chorus]

Yeah, hey yo, I'm on a job; see my eyes focused where the prize be
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
Just like 'Pac when they got him in the lobby
Try to tax, you'll find me like Ronald Isley
I's a changed man--ain't no if, ands, or probablies
Niggas used to know me--they don't even recognize me
Yup, the P-5-D is who the repertoire be
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear diary, the fans still swear by me
Even though I'm Late Night now like, ""Here's Johnny""
Swimming with them Great Whites now--that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
Forever grimy, I guess it's just Philly shining
Rock roller, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

The Roots,"Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the most high for high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin

Am I a douchebag or just another doo rag?
Tryna get ahead on some brand new wave shit
For your entertainment money is the language
So every time I speak I’m tryna make another payment
I do ‘em dirty sleep and get a dirt nap, that works
Tell my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I woulda learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryna burn fat
I don’t give a fuck, now maybe that’s abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain’t got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

I’m down to 95 dollars, that’s the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of ‘em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what’s ironic is
I’ve honestly been tryna do what’s right
But from your legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I’m a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin’ for physical pleasure if I don’t go mental first
Molly poppin’, trolley hoppin’
Know somebody prolly watchin’
That ain’t stoppin’ me from coppin’ a feel
Karate choppin’ in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin’
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Jonnie Cochran
Livin’ fast, drinkin’ capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, “You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass”
She keep a dick in a box and in an emergency break the glass
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I’m thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin’ he ain’t never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares

This is the Brother Question, broadcasting live 
Via satellite, from the Never Never Tunnels 
Now dig the rituals for today, is good music 
So sit back, relax and dig the groove 

Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop 
Not R&B because to me that's not my style and 
The are-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul 
The ones that's hip won't change the dial and

In the outback, on the songwritin' ship 
Blizz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff 
On the cloud I be relaxin' from last night and shit 
In studio today but hey Brother Question 
Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when 
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone 
And tell him to get ready (Question, what ya doin'?) 
(Ain't no thing) Yeah
Buttered chicken wings, so I met him in the West 
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes' 
Bassey broke down on the other side of town 
Yo you know what it's about, The Roots is out

Gots to break fast if we want to get, to the bus 
Runnin' like a Mex for the border 
(Um, yo, oh um, was it a bunch of yas?) 
Nah, just the four of us 
Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine 
(Three fine) fo' five mo' fine, uhh! 

A girl says, ""Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?"" 
And I'm like, ""Heh, word,"" 
And then the shorty passed the sign 
Now we got to make out exit (where?) 
To the pavement (to what?) Crushin' trail mix 
(Oh word man, yo look out) Say what? (look out!) 
Question dropped a whole bag of drumsticks 
(Ain't no thing) but a chicken wing, so 
He bends down to pick up the sticks 
And his pants fall down (dang!) 
In my face, Question didn't frown, turned around 
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed 
(Hahaha)

Sprouted from The Roots and I was added to the trio

At the Rat Cave, mic I'm hand, I'm flowin' 
Tellin Question, to keep it, goin' 
What I'm doin', I'm not really knowin' 
But umm, to me see it sounds oh-and-kay'n (it sounds OK) 
Layin', to the sounds playin' 
Um, hi to hoe and, yeah, hey to hay'n (uh-huh) 
Trippin', I'm tryin', not to laugh, bust it 
It's the last paragraph, and I'm done half 
But Question's jokin', and I'm like hopin' 
That nobody comes in and opens, the door

I'm leavin', what why you scratchin' your face like that man? 
Look ugly, self-righteous, do-gooder)

The Roots,"Peaceful minds, in a land of war 
Seek peace of mind, through mental peacefulness 
Peacefulness, peacefulness, peacefulness 
Is in the mind of the beholder 

Behold, my mental piece 
Could shatter your peace, to pieces 
Pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me 
The echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace 

Forcing me to retreat, to the below beneath 
Down a step and a step and a step and a step 
And a step beyond 
To a level of my own 

Private, mystic, ritualistic, culturalistic sanity 
Yet some say that I am insane 
Is that not ironic? My soul not sonic 
As I flow through the tonic, of life I find 

That the strife behind, that pushes and pulls 
And pulls and pushes me 
Into all of the bullshit that I experience from day to day 
Is the reason for my search, or journey, or struggle 

To find, the broken pieces of the sign 
That combine, to form the crooked line 
That we call, peace y'all",Peace

Yo, niggaz can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messenger born to blow up
My niggaz knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You wanna bust your fronts, with the butter, my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I'm rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the twelve gauge had the reci-play, inter-terrestrial-ly
My everyday M.O. is gettin' dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggaz'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggaz too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin' you what goes on

Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin' heads because, there's no fuckin' ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal sovereignt
Niggaz run around like ?, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a scar man

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall ?, wavin' white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin' about steppin' to me
Niggaz forget it, you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthenics

Tellin' the the strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin' you what goes on

It's the 'I remain calm' but for jurge to erk
Come out my humble go berzerk and make you swallow your smirk
I splurge most and bash, capacitate mass
I fascinate as I assassinate and show task
Characters and egos, get crushed in trust
And my words stampede like herds in a dusk
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
When heated up, I gets hotter cause I'm proper
You never knew the levitude the clever few
Different tax for revenue man if you ever knew
The tac-tic, strategies, of word, ca-pa-bil-ities
Display, de-cease
The rhythm, and man how it swerved and curved
Made a niggas dream but his hope deferred then stirred
Dig the mentals, Papermate, Bic's and Number 2 pencils
My credentials blow on instrumentals
I write an anthem throw a tantrum and remain handsome
Mysterious vibes, like I was the phantom
Erupt abruptly, then conduct amaze
You're fucked when the lyrics get bucked because I graze
Never animosity, on my property
Niggas acropoly, or they feel extreme monstrosity
Wreakin leak out the verbals ? don't forget it
The chief of edit then Malik'll shred it yeah I said it

I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb, when you put me on, I remain calm

That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed I inhale, equality follow me now son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll, similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin Phillies in the cellar
My acapella verse, can stomp, I delete comp
My rated X, larynx, wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin, lyrically amusin, I drink brews
Then when I'm groovin I'm no longer human
I'd like to take this time, to give a shout to all the money makers
In the house galore, they help me turn it out
I whip the cap to the max, I'm laid back, like your gramps
I make, niggas embarrased like they spendin food stamps
I take, my time when I rhyme lovely, me nah like
Ugly like, God we get odd to the rhythms
Rappers thinkin of steppin up, what the fuck you're doin?
I amplify the hymn, to bring your empire to ruin
Who's your girl screwin fellas? Jealous because I'm fly
Keep my sneakers dry, when you cry-baby
See, I can have you headin for the border, like a ReFugee from Haiti
Aiyyo, this brother drivin my cab, tried to flip, saying
""Pay me in advance"" -- I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark, with the rap devil, Black Thought
See niggas who get caught off guard remain scarred
Into air, with headphones remainin on the domes, they hair
I resound and astound and scare, I reign terror
Into another nigga rap era, my rhymes sedate
I lubricate, like aloe vera
I'm extreme, restin in the land of the plot and the scheme
Peace to ? Rock and the Equal Team

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field

A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Intro/There's Something Goin' On

My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo

Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw

I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair

I'm the fuck up outta here","Lesson, Pt. 1"
The Roots,"One two
Yes, The Roots layin' back, real-xin
Coolin' out with my man Malik be
We call him Sla-xon
YaknowhatI'msayin? We in effect
Mo like Al B. Sure, for your pleasure
Aiyyo bust it
We about to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip
We gon' set it like this
Yo check it

Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those afro picks, with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist, it's
The cause of that ""Oh shit!""
The skits I kick, flows like catfish
And got many emcees on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach
Offender want to go like Meshach, Black
Thought the nappy cat a bookworm shoe styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand
Of my mellow my man, Malik be

Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower
The professional, best in those skills that kills so uhh
Whoa, slow down before you go down (sissy)
Trixie this is Agatha Christie your slain and know now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote, when he croaks
They sayin', isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
'Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms
(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms
Capture, was to, whack ya
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rapture
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it slam
For my mellow my man

The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that

Yo, I got spunk, plus funk
And Jump Like Punks, to Get Beat Down
Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool
Deeper than the pool than Wilt the Stilt
Damn near drowned in clowns bounce to sound
When Thoughts pound
And brown's, my complexion section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, cause this kid gets
Grits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip dup damn
Yo I lost it but
Back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked, by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik be

Whoa, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh)
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats (say what?)
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust them
Even though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices
Twice this nice, this witch sure does her spices
I won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You want to turn and page your eyes, and try to plagiarize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hyp-ocrites
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, them ain't
That was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin the wrath
Of Malik, aiyyo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome
And then we cap, YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check

The Roots,"I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7, residing at the Mecca, rest address in south section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-six
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party everybody jocked [who me?]
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993 and
I shall proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm flyer when I'm higher put my shit up on a tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick it for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase, yes I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let them play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas ya see she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan, just think
Just think, what? What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?
As I proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Malik B get on the mic yo there's too much on my mind [say what?]
Malik get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fucking with The Roots, you know them niggas is the dime
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
And I could Metallica and Guns 'N Roses crash
Used to smash crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd I can make you say, ""He's superb""
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the lands where niggas scheme
So you know I got the sheen in my gleam

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic",Proceed
The Roots,"MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

The rhythm just sways and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and ri-vals, who wanna come
This way, they better pay attention
Or a penchant not to mention suspension
From the microphone plus the tension
Trey-eight-o's will vacate those
If there's drama with my henchmen
So lamp to my man Mussolini
Go get your whole staff, call the calf
Cause half-and-half's couldn't cream me
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Mannn, transss-gressin
You'll catch lead I, crushing
Poundin on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
I styles with my vocabulary
The Roots the one to call your ultra adversary
Now you're all desert cause I'mma serv ya like a tray
To meet your doom Malik's the boom so you get swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

Yo hello everybody do I need introduct
I be the mic mercenary very un..clear
To your ear the exquisite pattern that you hear
It's known to be Black Butta Baby
Crazy cardiac my attack on any fat rhythm
That I capture kid I snatch the mic from tykes
While I proceed and continue to tend to
Business, cause this is, how I do
I'm insane, and go against the grain like freight
Never on no nigga dick, cause I'm just too hip
Plus I rest where niggas pack and never act
Other than ill, shit is real in Phy-double
So if you want trouble let's stomp
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

Thought to myself, should of said a little louder 
Bet hurry up before she gets lost in the crowd of 
""Excuse me Miss, excuse me miss"" 
""No, I'm not havin it!"" I just got dissed 
I didn't get mad, was calm and collect 
I didn't call her bitch, I didn't break her neck 
Start to wonder why the brothers disrespect the cutie 
It's a place of 180's and the high-priced floozie

The brown, rhymer organically grown, I've shown, while
Sip-pida-didip-styles and proceed, to flow
You know I'm flyer than G.I. so yo Joe
Fuck, I run amuck, cause I'm the father of the fattest skatter
Black is intellectual, cat that is perpetually
Ritually catchin wreck, don't step, I cut ya
I mix the Sector 6 and now I knowledge butter words
To prop up Afrika Bambaataa, a lotta, brother is out there
Waitin on that new shit, well this is how we do kid
The levels is correct one-two, call in a blunt too
The front two, run through, good for you
Brand new styles like Kung-Fu
And rip this from the front to the back
To all my peoples where you at I know you dig it when I kick

Out of sockets, the extra-curricular particularly this
Miraculous in lyrics they be callin me Jesus
Please just call me Malik I'm not a prophet
Pass me a topic and I'll drop it

Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom, in my room at the Ramada
Four tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit
Because my click'll make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix

Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-why
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With air smooth, takin' niggaz loot with dice
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
Ridin' in, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings and brins swings when I sings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin your dreams, I gasp with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, re-color fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under blunderin' I'm not, lyrically
Ya getm, shot, get caught so distort with thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin' move fakin' I isn't
Niggaz can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin' what is it
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and hers like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
SO policies, of equalities, get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged
Together, damn it's quite clever, however
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow of culture, rhythmical vulture
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle
Strangle from every angle, my lingo hingles and it jangles
Under Kangols, nahh them niggaz don't want to tangle
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you say you maybe, then come in to flex
Now you wonder what's next",Distortion to Static

I inflict properly, ain't nobody risin on top of me
I be droppin more plot in my mic monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or I clue they say baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin on inside my brain
You're scared, jealous
No analyst can maintain or handle this...
Mind train, yo

So niggaz best get out of my path

Facing these leads to cats diminished

The Roots,"It's a lazy afternoon

Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
Of the Jeep pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20
Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I
Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss click Now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
Sayin' ""Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat""
Now it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest
With the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out
As I parlay in my room cause it's a lazy afternoon

It's a lazy afternoon

Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I
Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss click Now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
Sayin' ""Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat""
Now it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest

The Roots,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grazed in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a--motherfuckin-rap--muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbread for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetrate in this void

Ya leave niggas missing in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[He heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin that I'm insane
When I'm taggin my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin a train honeydip and I'mma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin
If you wanna know better ask brother question
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair

Yo, I had a Queen named Amina, height 5'7""
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
Like some shit from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brotha, I call her my sugar sista
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin an' shit
Like, ""Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin to hit I could quit speakin'
Tariq in fact, you bein BlackThought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed ta
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya""

Crazy frustration, about my lovin' situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin'
I want some Marvin Gaye healin', feelin' is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd
Love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin' and sexually neglect
Then sayin' I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinnin'
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into communication
Temptation played the vandal, freakin' my brain, my mind
Rippin' the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo! She knew what I wanted, but she fronted
Bust it

Well umm
Movin' right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And livin' trife, while I open ya mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin' like you're makin' me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin' killa pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin' or no guessin'
Undressin', carressin', in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggaz with a lot of dough

The Roots,"I the voyeur, peer, as she begins her, ritual 
Paying sexual ties for few and untrue 
Words of admiration, translation: 
Sucker ass, lines, of trash 
Spewing from First One's unskilled lips 
That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp 
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance 
Through the back door 
""Bend over bitch, you know this is what you were born for; 
To dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor 
And take it in, that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore"" 
Her subsequent screams seemed to praise 
Sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain 
But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass 
As he quicker comes, then Third and Fourth One just as dumb 
Invite themselves to join in 
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style 
While Fourth One says, 
""Don't she got some DSL's, make a nigga joint just swell, 
To think? I want to sink my inches, into that bitch's, 
Berry-framed mouth"" 
So one goes North, the other South 
To sanctified places where in-house spirits 
Will later wash away all traces, of their ill-spoken words 
And complacent faces 
And then, like their Minutemen, predecessors 
Lude, aggrandized sexual endeavors, end up rough 
Cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up 
Corrupt, Fifth One steps to her 
Hip-Hop clothed just to, think he gonna impress her 
""Hey Slim, I heard you was a spinna, sit on up 
Top this thing, black dick, and work it like a winner"" 
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her 
But suddenly he, stops mid thrust 

Seems she nameless to 'cause, got his stuff in a death cunt clutch 
He fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch 
Just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch 
Now here comes Six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix 
Talkin' smack at that 
Saying, ""Girl, I'ma wax that ass, and stick that slit so hard, 
You gonna be calling me God"" 
So he proceeds to poke and prod 
With clumsy finger and wack sex slinger 
""Condoms make me last longer,"" wrong, cause her 
Motions of snatch, however detached from the situation 
Cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation 
It seems she just wastin' 
Good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven 
Who ain't learned their lesson 
He wants to enter the flesh divine 
By dropping a kind of semi-sweet line 
""Your honey hole so fine and mile deep; I'm gonna leap 
Into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin"" 
So he jumped in and then, he drowned 
Got lost and found in her Tart Canal 
Slave to the waves, made him cum for days 
Eighth and Last One turn arise 
Plys her with familiar lies 
Even more familiar still, cause 
Him she used to love 
But he never could quite see above, her mound 
A pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice 
So poised, she rises, Phoenix from the flame 
Finally bored with their feeble fuck games 
She smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim 
At eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded Glock 
Parts lips, not expressly made for milding dicks 
And then, she speaks: 

Your shrieks of horror bring me bliss, I must admit 
The thought that I could shred your tips with eight quick flips 
Excites me, see y'all fuck with the pussy 
But I fuck with your minds 
Lack of soul and respect is the crime

Yo, niggas can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messanger born to blow up

At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You want, I'll bust your fronts, with the butt of my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest so play, and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggas'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real

Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggas too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin heads because, there's no fuckin ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
Niggas run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a sun tan

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall hinder, wavin white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin about steppin to me
Niggas forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthetics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Talent is strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin you what goes on

Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest 
To see who ""Gets Money"" 
No milk and honey, in this land

So it's play dirty or die by the hand 
That's holding all the guns 
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision 
To save me and my daughter's lives, but 
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture 
The picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her 
In a life wanting for nothing 
So I got into this drug thing 
Not doing, but dealing 
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds 
Of the doomed became my mission 
Izm was just too small time 
I had to find the best design to 
Fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds, and pockets 
So I sold ? kits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits 
And, five year old preschool pussy 
And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out 
Weary racks of snatch, in other words
I sold crack 
Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep, 
Silk sheets and money heaps 
Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to 
Boarding school to keep shit under cover 
All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes 
Plus his, game I was playing, and winning 
While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold 
I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen 
To me I seemed unstoppable, my coffers full 
I went buckwild, wanting more 
Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore 
No time for playing with my coochie 
Counting my man's mad lucci 
While he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece 
I signed the checks and, I counted out the cash 
Wasn't saving ass for no niggaz sent upriver 
I thought my shit was tight
Til my empire started to quiver 
Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to 
And watched, like Assata Shakur 
My place on the top was no more sure 
Loose lips flipped the script 
The fantasy trip, swiftly ended 
It took no time to blend in, with the population prison 
My jaded vision, busted like a cherry 
Every, dream I had, now tainted bad 
I fucked and, I killed, to prosper 
Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel 
Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice 
A land of fields to toil in like slaves 
No lilies in this field just plenty of souls to save 
Plenty of fat uniformed rats with 
Below average size cocks that slither 
Through cell locks, in the night 
Lactating tits being licked, left and right 
Plenty of coochie, burning with desire 
Like black churches in the South 
Black prayers and pussy on fire 
Penned up behind barbed wire 
Me and my fellow female mammals, animals 
Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages 
Minds haunted by our children's faces 
They mace us, with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption 
Place smoking guns in empty hands of, native sisters and sons 
I joined in this nation's favorite pastime 
On a quest to gets mine 
Now I'm passing time standing on line 
In the commissary to buy Maxi-Pads 
Instead of shopping at Barney's for Chanel bags 
Nana who raised me, went to bed a-dazed 
Via my mistakes, and my daughter hates 
Me for what I did 
And I'm fucked, and I'm stuck 
Doing the Devil's bid 
Being locked in a moral corrupt crib

You want to get finger fucked tonight?

Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face

Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous

My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
I breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a falcon
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cap you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggaz
Whether small, middle-sized, or tall niggaz

Well it can only be for one night

Trust me it's somethin' bout the way I touch her
The way that I hold her, the way I clutch her
She move a lot but that ain't shit to me
Man, I need that bitch and that bitch need me
And I ain't even talkin' bout r.a.p.

Heads froze, they peepin' outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold
Well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle
Depressin' um, load with this gun hold
Wild like a sun sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass
Entire crews pass not making the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever have transform to the war path
Pure wrath from north down to 24th and Task
Games store the half the niggas you were prayin the streets
Tainted with camouflage, guerrilla sabotage
My cousin's da ratatard was livin tight large
Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lambar
So many so called hearts scared they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick up kids is jumpin' outta played the Dodge Rams to jam

You ain't missin' of life ain't what this should be

Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Top see nigga think slice of dream
Yo I'm fast for the buck do anything for the cream
Never seen a case like this although it's quite contagious
He even got his little bother actin' all outrageous
From dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk
They do anything and everything tryin to come up
It's kinda sickenin' how the cash is so fucking addicted
And when I say some bout they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
Cause the loot is for the takin' and not for the givin'
Then ya got this world well I say I'ma die hustlin'
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in
I guess the couple just did not know the truth
Cause the following week I seen threw him of the roof
And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whap for somethin' less than a pat
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
Thought he was his brothers keep but fuck all that

Americas worst nightmare guns against hands

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

It was the year of '84 I was tryin ta get in the mix
The year the niggas roll with sheepskins gazelles and kicks
Even got the patten leather Adidas snatched of your feet
Man that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first sto was word to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties and search for Cinderella
Was just a little man real bold
Tryin to act grown and old so da respect can be shown
A Hip Hop a little copped in and break dancing
When niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins
Remember Zigglers? Uptown the bottom to Natrona and
St. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang
H-are-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow
Niggas was snatching gazzeles and flipping pockets for the dallo
You run ya little wolf chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge
Aggravated assault another weekend in the precinct
Take everybody for their ring man that's how we think
Back then you catch a sucker punch off guard
Niggas will pull you card trying to walk around all hard
Niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service
When you see fifty niggas deep with Scully's get nervous

Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed in to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - Tariq Agenda how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated- I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Driftin (the hypnotic, the hypnotic)

I would begin to dial
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

But it's deceased now only lives the true realance

Because I'm liable, to do this

For this capital gain bein' that we in the rap game
It's time to have it all; he said he figured he same
We realized this a planet of cream to obtain
When the predominant rap, conglomerate rap spark the flame
Hark the name, the fifth from the Ill-Power Hill at that
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil'
Where niggas think that killing's living real
Shorty's is getting wetted, fulfilling their fantasies to set it
We don't sweat it, by the fifth you get beheaded
I pivot through my borough givin' pounds to the dreaded
At the lye spots I got credit; could run 'em down
In alphabetical order it's sorta pathetic
Yo, I'm livin' life within a labyrinth of nonsense
This is a consequence of being Philly residents
Tryin' to get it on, the rhythm gettin' shitted on
The exquisite I exhibit to shine, yo

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

I walk through this field with criminals
Ill, die-hard soldiers try to make it towards the generals
Hard-headed, rugged captains walkin' head on through action
Turnkeys on the closed caption
I bring the skills of wizardry
Treat emcees with bigotry, so now you see the picture vividly
Seduce your brain from the temple over instrumentals
The fifth chant; you see the exhaust out
The swift camp mannerism is to scan your vision
You see the light; you can't eclipse the sun
We call back the young, but still they'll strap a gun
To shoot caps that spook cats and rappers hung
Now you might tube across from the diners where you find 'em lost
Niggas hearts so cold, they sport frost
The M-the-ilitant, the Bad Lieutenant kill your camp
You're now a victim of reality, my personality
Afflicted, for three to five if convicted
Illicit, because most cats will live corrupted
It ain't no pity in this; inner-city niggas fuckin'
Exquisite, I exhibit the shine; now check it out

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

Inclined to rap about facts; I never fake jacks
Shit is real like E-packs, forty fifty-sixes
Trims and gimmicks couldn't faze the true heartache
When I first started, but then few remember this
Anti-gangsta bitch, sporting new jewels
Plain Jane styles internal to the naked eye
Derived from mind states of Cold Crush tapes
And beat breaks seduced by means to elevate
Equates my views with the passing
Those matching this intellect identify, for like minds
Intertwine one thought in unison
We exquisite, I exhibit the shine, ah

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind

And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind

The Roots,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

y'all know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurar, preditar of a competitar
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like ""nah"", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack a-biliti?
Make your words known, amplify the you-tiliti
I'm crooked like the ""I"" on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest
Reflect, then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex
With my man low to flex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next flow
So my man, my mizza, my man
M-ilitant, what's the master plan?

Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity

Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up wait, sit straight
It's in mil, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs
When I strike, I stay severe, niggaz stay low in they glare
From over here, my Range Rover square to blast offside
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous

See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin back at it
The Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin automatic
Mic, rippin asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggas is livin highly medicated
I Used to Love Her but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

Wild niggas, like I'm high on latari
Some let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec be at the places I be
Hey, I'mma be back on the deck, opening
Business in places for you to cash your check
My, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs, and still get had
The sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake
They tryin to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate
Call each other cuz cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate
Harmonizing through beeper and reefer

The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation

I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home

Keepin' ya party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, ""Yo, we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured; it's nothing sacred

A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya; get the party live
I'm black thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhymes sayin' rent payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain; that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadel-phi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short ""I want it made"" like Ed; 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed

And discover my level is that of no other

 Some innocent ak that would front
 To flip the rock on them at King Street block
 Similar to the blood now floodin his top

I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
into the deep cosmos

But before the raw live shows
I remember I'se a little snot-nosed
Rockin Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes
Learnin the ropes of ghetto survival
Peepin out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
When it came to gettin mine I ain't tryin, to argue

Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggaz had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police, in her I found peace (like who?)
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, trickin off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losin weight, not picky - with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggaz she know is dirty
Havin more babies than Lauryn, she started showin early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testin me
In _Retrospect_ I see she brought _Life_ and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, makin the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

I would begin to dial -
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

In 1987, I linked up wit the question 
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen 
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven 
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven 
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon 
Swollen wit minds that got stolen 
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen 
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water 
Fathers sexually assaultin' they own daughter 
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle 
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle 
In a game of life, yo it's hard to roll a double 
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples 
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms ""fuck you"" 
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left 
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas 
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness

Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor

Caught in the Hype Williams, and lost H-E-R. direction
Gettin' ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H-E-R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H-E-R
Her daddy'll beat H-E-R, eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggaz had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The police, in her I found peace (like who?)
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, trickin' off
Tried to make a hit with H-E-R but my dick went soft
Movin' weight, losin' weight, not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggaz she know is dirty
Havin' more babies than Lauryn, she started showin' early
As of late I realized, that this is H-E-R fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testin' me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
Over H-E-R I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, makin' the right moves

It's nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new

Ghetto related with this hit the whole world awaited
Y'all dorito-head cats that yak and stagnated
Black thought, the Doug E. most war vete-ran
Crown ruler, soul controller of this lyrical land
Spliff wizard kid, who is it?
Fifth dinosaur ghetto, beat detonator
Apex my level, next, my complex pattern of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of makin' you snap the necks
And chase Manhattan endorse my mic checks
Upset, poet threat
Just collectin' my debt, yo I'm overpaid in dues
Blood tears and sweat, when you fuckin' with the roots
That's as good as it get, ultra magnet
We pull you in a drag-net then brainwash your click
And extort your assets, then roadie all your homies
On some old school shit, roots crew represent
Life's a gamble, step up and place your bets
I drift through space, then make my escape on through the 'net
With CD's, cassettes, no C.O.D.'s or checks
Straight from the old school, aiyyo raw's in full effect
I'm like, Lex Luthor with rifles filled with kryptonite
When you grip the mic it's like c'mon kids, let's say goodnight
You don't like me but don't even know why should you hate me
You scared to face these so I still remain safely
Confidin', north phil' where I'm residin'
Never let an outside nigga slide in
This ain't home plate, I dunk on you once inside the paint
Flow like this you can't, take me you out, you ain't

Nuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, tell me what you could do
Yo we drop the funk, and do the shit

Yo, head lost, sippin' this limbic framboise
Spittin' it for like whoever demand the answer
What's the cure for this hip-hop cancer? Equivalent
To this avalanche of black snow, rap flow
To get my people thinkin' mo', we at the brink of war
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more next music explore
It's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think the roots get the world respect for?
The splendid authentic hip-hop that's raw core
Severe, world premier, a superior sophomore
No doubt, wherever you dwell, that's where the bomb fell
Explodin' from the imperial en-sem-ble, for real
From the ven-ue to the avenue
We truly only got respect for a few, y'all ain't sayin' nuttin' new

Blow up y'all, it's nuttin' new, nuttin' new

Look at y'all you just a army ant, I'm a gi-ant, arm fist
King of my city, runnin' this shit, just like a ty-rant
Y'all clowns know what I meant, that's if we at war
Then my henchmen, will be at your back door, uhh
Waitin', wise at debatin', trippin' over legos
Runnin' up the steps and lookin' for a weapon
But you come out wavin' a white flag, that's why
I just back slap that ass like shaq did ostertag
Either take me or be taken, you think I'm goin' down?
Psych, the jury, they're still deliberatin'

Nah I'm just playin' yo but that's how I'm playin' doe

The Roots,"We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Runnin one on one and only hip-hop bound
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
(It sound tight) well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, bustin this blunt, instrument spit
The magnificent, rapper's run from it
All fly girls, nipples and toes, numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
(What nigga?)  The Black Thought and M-O-S Def done it
Who the ultimate?  Yo my man speak upon it

Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

Aiyyo, keep your tape rollin so you catch every bar
of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touchin surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggaz just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
(eh-eh-eh-eh) Now you niggaz can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit, useless, they got they tools missin
Watch me, grand prix, champy for wealth driven

Yo, you go one for my hustle (hustle)
Two to rock rhyme (two to rock rhyme)
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illets of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they run it down one of mine
Thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggaz is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
by the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

Yo, me and Kamal and Leanord Hubbard, ?uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travellin
Give me the mic, we on that again
b-boy business, off the top actin and battlin
Servin them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow

Brace yourself, it's about to go down

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They takin total control, of the body and brain
Flyin high in the sky, on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginnin to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest

Blows to chest 
No breath 
Air gasps 
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch! 
With each hit, each kick, each, broken rib 
Crack, crack! 
Bones are crying 
Mommy's crying and bleeding 
And pleading 
And then 
Daddy wants to fuck 
Dick hard, swelled with power rush 
And as if all that wasn't enough 
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth 
As, Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear 

First, lullaby 
First, son, will, ever, hear 
And never forget 

Mommy almost bled to death when she have him, finally 
She'd already lost, three 
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak 
From being daily beat 
And Friday nights were the worse and 
Daddy never came with flowers 
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot 
With some bar pop named Cookie 
Putting his thing down 
Soiling Mommy's sheets with
Sweet, talk shit, 
Cookie's cheap lipstick, 
Hair grease, sperm, and Jezebel juice 

To hell with the good news that
He was a father for the first time 
His thirst for wine and women 
Clouded his vision 
No warm welcome for mother and son 
Just 
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum 
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense 
She, burned the dirty linens 
Made a fresh bed 
Laid sleeping First Son down 
And never made a sound 
As she purged her scourge 
With birth-blood and quiet tears 
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice 
Lie there in his soft skin and new life 
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye 
Mommy's little survivor 
Like, her 

Mommy called crazy and scorned 
Cause she two more born 
One boy soon after 
The girl much later and 
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
Her, First Son, the first one 
Whose, womb-world was profaned 
Came of age playing street games 
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother 
'Till his heart start to wither 
In pain and shame 
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her 
And him
Let, sins of the Father cause his innocence to wander 
Found out amongst thieves 
Chose to squander his dreams 
Stopped believing in himself 
Become prodigal with his life 
Make impossible shit right with
Gang-ties, crime, lies 
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother 
Replaced them with absurdities of others 
Who had also lost their way 

Played a different kind of street game now 
First Son plunged deep 
Speak street-family vows 
Espouse no causes but his own 
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp 
Or, protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath 
Couldn't shield her ears from
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers 
His only defense-served be confidence 
Brown bottles housed his swift descent 
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans 
Now, Daddy and him twins in addiction 
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends 
By liquefied demons 
Had become what he despised from conception 'til end 
Destined for a demise 
Survived nine lives of staying high 
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft 
Womanizing, only for money, never for sex 
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head 
Left for dead 
So, eyes wide and glassy 
Speech, slowed and slurred 
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy 
And mouth corners one December 24th

Took final ride to suburban supplier 
Shots were fired by the gray man 
With shaky hand 
But not shaky enough to miss
Hit, Lost Boy in back 
So-called Friend runs for door 
Leaves First Son blood-born 
Lying alone in blood on cold floor 

Death was the cause of

M-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
I float across seas and, breezed across land
Standin', in these thoughts of murder within
The structure of this world that's corrupted with sin
I'm always hittin', to leave MC's guessin'

There will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated
Buddha session, to stop stressin'
Me with the madness, puttin' niggaz on my had list
No sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt

My weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter
My attitude a product of society
So sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me
Niggaz eyein' me, with looks of they anxiety
Wonderin' what's in my heart, velocity or piety
Yo, it depends on which one, you bring to surface
At times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose
Malik be blend with the tree, to spot an enemy
You cloggin' me up cat, now vacant the vicinity

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

I'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik
Don't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid
Route through your district, we keep it simplistic
No need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt
Show me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase
Wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
I'm tryin to get it, these rain bottlin' thoughts become acidic
With one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it
A girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered
I take what you got to give, cause I got to live
The last hour, I bet your ass you act sour
Might act up, but I still can pass dowa
I'm usin' new ways to try to reach these better days
Instead of tryin' to take you under I just make you wonder
I still fast, make salaat, and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
Livin' two lives, one of turn and one with true lies
Keepin' a hoe, knowin' these hands into my do'as
In the quarters livin' modest with my nigga Trotter
I circle my foes, like tawaf around the kaba
I used to live life, like there was no mañana
Now I'm treatin' every breath, like it was your honor
I'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm
Like a pillar, I'm I and T-L like Manilla

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with

Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud

If you were worried 'bout where

What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop
And keep tellin me

And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering ""she tryin to play you for the fool Black""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some ""oh I'm a celebrity""
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you

How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck

In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe
Off, comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe

Bad misses throwing raspberry kisses on me
You looking for direction girl I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweatin' we ain't 'sposed to be involved
Knowin' when we get it off girl I mean it all

Keepin' ya pheenin' 'til you're taken and tossed
And when I'm breakin' it off there's no denying the fact it's strong
'Cuz you got a man who's probably playin' his part
You probably breakin' his heart he's trying to figure the reason you gone

Is it 'cuz he's superficial or is he too submissive?
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic?
Or is it 'cuz you really couldn't see a future with him
All he 'bout is paper never took the time to choose or listen

You wanna get gripped up, flipped and thrown
And get strictly shown the way to get in the zone, of course
Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll with the one who's breaking you off

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe
Off, comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe

Rolling down the highway listening to Sade sing
""The way the smooth operator move my way""
You sitting beside me looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body

Keep each other thristy, kisses like hershey
But lips is sealed 'cuz we dont need the controversy
I say I'm in town, you say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday

Meanwhile, it's champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life
We breakin' down like we grove dogs pulling a hike
You making sounds like a vive got you reaching your height

Prepare for flight, this is your captain, I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength that it's attraction girl
Workin' with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one who's breaking you off

Baby, baby, baby don't you want me 'round
Nothing 'cuz I'm coming, and do you know
Whenever you want that thing you need I'm there and I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you, babe, babe

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe
Off, comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off, yeah babe

And what she's fittin' to have she don't know
She wants neo soul cause hip hop is old
She don't want no rock'n roll
She want platinum, ice and gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you're an obstacle she'll just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary's bad
In these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
Because you're quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much but enough to room to spread my wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, just listen to me

I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lovers behind my lovers back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we headin' for she don't know
We in the city where the pro shake rattle 'n roll
And I'm a god dang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold a chrome
And it's weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is the only one
And Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matter of fact I've been keeping it cool
Since money been changin' hands
And I'm left to shine, the legacy I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from a rich man
And I don't scream and kick when his shit don't fall in my handsman
Cause I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lovers will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Oh you know the deal you'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Oh break it down, down for me
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've takin' my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it rock 'n roll

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right

Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)
(Once again it's time, it's time)
It's time to ride, ride

Yo, piss in the staircase, blood on the pavement
I fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages
Compose another anthem for the killers and manglers
Villains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber
Shit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta
Pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
Then bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger
I'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents
We muscle the language
What 'Riq spit will leave your shit in utter amazement
I'm hot brolic call it contagious
The shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes
My vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish
Y'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages
Is something in the iris and the way I spit
That tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit
Black traumatic, so there you have it
My battin' average, abort full of graphic assault, it's all classic
Thought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
Experience is all that is, I'm well established
Me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
The technique in your reach, if only you could have it
For me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro
Poet for hired pack metal
You feel me?

Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)

It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the load heavy
We walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady
Withdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures
Niggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
Cryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen
The story in the ghetto the same
Seem like it's just some things that never will change
Give birth to a style and won't give it a name
Talk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang
Envision again, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak
The understandable diabolique, animal style
Out of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this
Fifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious
Inject you with the broke down english
The most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq Geez, guess what the fame is
Kareem's beat makin' me fiendish
Don't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga

Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)
Tonight (cheeba cheeba yo, soul shock yo)
(Give it everything you got yo)
(Once again it's time, it's time)
It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the rebel Jake Rivera
You felt another date, you better
Don't copped off, create it just save your cheddar
I hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
Sippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter
Driftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens
Sands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning
The flash and the cash and the fast women
It's nothing, a lust for the craft keep the passion and
Blaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins
Poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
MCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again
Must have seen their face in the news it's gots to been
Thought known as the cure for cancer
Same corrupt city as Mumia the Panther
Man to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff
Bang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall
Yo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
Bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
Thing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all
Thought, diesel like a 28-inch python
You know what I'm saying?

When I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin'

Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with
Like death
Riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
It was like dat
Me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit
Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed
An all your Sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh anyway

I can see something in the way of our selves
I can see something in the way of our selves
That's why I say the things I do, you know it
But its something else to you

Like that job
This morning when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning soft behind you
Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

My mistake is I kept sayin' ""that was proof that God didn't exist""
And you told me, ""nah, it was proof that the devil do""
But still, its like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag

Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk which you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit

And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see

But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something stalking us

Like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it
But then we got to argue

And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the (light or mic??) is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?

The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too but can't call its name

Ain't it too bad why'all said
Ain't it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha
Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad

I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will

And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You want to know what

You want to know what I'm talkin' about
Sayin' ""I seen something in the way of things""
And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
The is? in that face and remember now, remember all them other faces

And all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face

Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else

Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
Wit his ass on fire
Or the solomNOTness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

I seen something
I SEEN something
And you seen it too
You seen it too

In Illa you a poet son
You a ball creator

""The way the smooth operator move my way""
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?
We breakin' down like we grove dogs pulling a hike
You making sounds like a vive got you reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength
That its attraction girl
Workin' with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one
Who's breaking you off

Baby, baby, baby, don't you worry bout
Nothing 'cause I'm coming to handle you
Whenever you want, that thing you need, I got it
I'm there and I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you
Baby, baby

Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Yeah baby

Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Comin' to break you off(beat started, start-started)
Yeah baby",Break You Off
The Roots,"[Chorus: x2]
I've been wondering about the complexity
Of what we have it shouldn't be
More
Just can't see
More

You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
Yo your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

[Chorus]

When your boyfriend's in town, it's bound to be trouble, Love
His name Black, and he known to be a lover of
Getting it on with my smoker's jacket on
Eyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan
Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
'Cause it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling
Girl, all in all I never leave you stranded
'Cause my respect you commanded, you figure it out

[Chorus]

I used to come into the party and stand around
'Cause I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you
That's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work

You will be standing next to me

Yo, my own head once said, it's more powerful than cocaine
Freaks dancin' in a line like Soul Train
To get your pride up, that extra push
Niggaz lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush
Yo I know sis', dawg, her name Lorraine
She's a thick brick house with a chocolate frame
I went to school with her
Twelfth grade, I used to fool with her
She put me on with her squad, I got cool with her
She used to say she wanted to be a doctor
And couldn't nothin' stop her
From gettin' up that cash
For tuition, even if she had to shake that ass
Fucked up, her money ain't accumulatin' that fast
Lorraine know it's real, 'cause sex controls America
Turn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo
What the freaks in the video for?
Fuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore

You see, life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore

Yo, desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil
So it's promoted like it is so all y'all know
Keep a nigga under the spell, you under control
But yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists
Weakness, pussy make a spy say secrets
But what for? Cause sex is the law
???, many an empire rise and fall
From the squares to the players
From the pimps to the whores
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
Ya know, I sit back and just peep thangs
Nine outta ten, it's the same songs, only the beat changed
So don't be lookin' at your peeps strange
When I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range
That's when you see me up on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks fittin' to get crunk with this

Life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Corporations going to war over the pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record stores, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore

Yo, fresh cut, with the thick black velor
With the black ??? sneaks, headed out for tour
Lookin' out the limo window up at the billboards
Two hundred miles, she was the only thing I saw
Promotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine
Cell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings
You gotta show a little skin to get them listening
For real yo, the world is a sex machine
Full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
That go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
Half the time, it ain't even responsibly
Tryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin' to be
Ghetto, Sin City, where the P is free
You catch a bid far worser than a one to three
All up in the after-hours on the second floor
For that good thing, that keep 'em comin' back for more, ya heard me

Ayo y'all rappers less play, what I'm about to say
Will probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and I've been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzin' off the killin' dispense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aimin' straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments mad vocabulist
Yes I must confess
I'm like Diddy tryin' to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that it's Black you can tally up that
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split it's Black comin'
You can tell it's a hit, comin' to drop you nigga

We will rock you

Yo y'all savages is primitive
I'm true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rhyme hypnotist
Making sound waves
Prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent Pope distributors

Niggas tell me how they never comin' better then frame
They love what I say
Here come the rebel breaking the frame and it's all true
My earning bars arts is martial
I'm comin' to off you

When you least expect it I'm gonna step out the
darkroom pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice

As much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one the noose or the gun
Cause you're getting banged or hanged
Thought second to none nigga

Yo check it out whether you ballin' or just one the
wall and groovin' groovin'
We've come to get it kickin' and get the movement movin'
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin'
Remember your development with out any music
Spit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mic as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money ain't no need for makin' excuses
Burn you fuckin' with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro than cut your fro off
I been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word

Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's just pro blackness
Grown man tactics no pediatrics
The kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst. Thought with the knack of splashin'
I'm dashin', I mastered the craft of mashin'
The level-headed thoroughbred the females passion
Magnetic attraction be keeping em askin'

The crews in the Cadillac, the Pendergrassin'
Swerve half-naked won't come near crashin'
But if I go to Heaven would ya'll know my name
Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for your freedom dog, that's what's happenin'

The hustle is a puzzle, each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction

From Bolivia to Boulder

How we gon' make it through the dark?
I'll show ya.

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
Listen,
If you want to be high

Yo kick off ya shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes from off ya block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins wit ya men's who you thought could box
A couple people wanted thought to stop
But guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time greedy stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lackluster
Gotta put it to ya straight

Came close to the utmost but no cogar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award-winning it's the world's eighth wonder
Come on!

You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
If you want to be high

Yo, your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in a capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though,
I get in the zone, recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology, fraud or tricknology
Just trust what I see and I say and follow me
My way, I be the open book, look inside me
The star of the story that the grooveteller guide me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the true gon' sense it

Since granddaddy old Desoto stopped and he got the Caddie
I been gladly servin, any y'all cats want to act determined
Spit pesticides for rats and vermin
Seem like none of y'all chumps is learning
Y'all hopeless, and I'm a little better than dope is
Far from a brand new kid to show biz
Tryna hold on, maintain my focus
Coming out a room with a could of smoke
Smokers rolling with the punches
I survive and rock
Cause I keep the crowd alive
And the texture of my voice
Is course and kind of hoarse and cut
Like I'm throwing a thousand knives

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

The man at hand that rule the school
And reach and teach the blind and find a way from A to Z
And be the most to boast I'm load and proud
The game and reign that remain
The heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the
More higher level of depth one step beyond dope
To suckers all scope and hope to cop a note
Cause I could never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let it speed around the board like an astro
And send them to jail for tryna pass go
Shaking them up
Breaking them up
Taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So quest love let the fire roast
So I can flow and we can kill the whole show cause

Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

I'm live
Design a finer rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates thought from divine
You can take it as a caution or a warning sign
Look for antonyms
Words I'm sending em
Homonyms, synonyms good like M&M's
You know the time when it's Riq Gees slicing
I turn a Mic's last name into Tyson
My brain like a factory constantly creating
Materials stitch by stitch for decoration
My lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining
My passion of rhyming is fashion designing
Now it get sorted cause people want to sport it ya bought it
If you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises it's like a game show
And my brain go
I do my thing yo

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom

That's what's happenin on stage",Boom!
The Roots,"Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles; coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science; science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

'Riq geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun
Black master of any trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue
Clear my path and come get your captain hung
Trying to breath like black'll collapse your lungs
Young chump you could choke off the web I spun
I done cleared 'em out from the threat I brung
You done heard about what set I'm from
My nigga, word-a-mouth little rule-a-thumb
Y'all better bow down when the ruler come
I'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum
The way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all
Cats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all
With a keyboard got do with a drum 'n all
School 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar
Professional type, I'm adjusting my mic
Go to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like
Give you something to run from
Bust off your dum-dum
Stop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from
It's philly world-wide phenomenon
And reinforcin' that shit is my nine to five
And when I finish making you recognize
I'm getin' at a couple civilized women that's tryin' to ride
You were waitin' on the raw to come off the oil
You wanna get the bitches up off the wall
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To keep you in health, this for all of y'all
I'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw
And I can't tell what y'all cats rappin' for
My name 'riq geez and I'm back for more
To get more chips than the corner store
With a portrait of Malcom X on the door
While I'm eatin' MCs like a carnivore
Matter fact, ease back 'fore you get harmed
Ring the, warning horn when I'm gon' perform
The first nigga that move, or disturb the groove
I'm a have y'all flicks on the evening news
Play y'all part, get on y'all P's and Q's
And when y'all think Thought, be prepared to lose
Bring money to spend and somebody to lend
And some worthwhile money not twenties and tens
Get took for your tuck right in front of your 'hens
Who coulda help you nigga, not none of ya friends
Because, I put a black fist under ya chin
Have your physical remains found under the pen
If I'm coming up in the place, I'm coming to win
Wasn't in it for a minute, now I'm dumbin' again
'Riq geez ock, y'all can chat what y'all please
Receive what I'm gonna give back to y'all please
'Cuz y'all don't really wanna get clapped with all these
My man, you can take y'all strap when y'all leave
You see the squad come in the place, they all freeze
Ice cold, with his mellow cool breeze
MCs, never showed loyalty yet
Kool Herc ain't never get a royalty check
I do work, no question, and bomb your set
I'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette
RIP my man Gillette
Until I touch the mic, y'all people ain't seen danger yet
I'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck
Never hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks
If you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes
I spit, live rounds that would penetrate a vest
Nigga, take ya seats I'm a demonstrate a test
How to freak the beats, so gangsta fresh
And it thump, from the east coast to Bangladesh
Big bank, willy gank smoke the thing to death
But hold tight, cuz it's not over yet
I don't even feel like I'm not sober yet
And it ring like shots in the projects new year's eve
And it ain't even October yet
I'm a big bounty hunter like Boba Fett
Y'all more shell shocked then a soldier get
If the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this
Whoo whoo 'riq geez be the ultimate
I'm the corporate, give me the bulk of this
'Riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip
Get down how you 'posed to get
I got nothing to lose, I'm a killer with no regrets
I'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell
Makin' niggaz screw face like Gargamel
Now I'm all out on my own like Patty LaBelle
Put the pimp game down on your mademoiselle",Web

Kamikaze south splash like it shot from a gauge

Reed pipe but deed tight, disposition keep on flipping
Keep em playing they position
Keep making the people listen what I spin
Put em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat, leaking out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not setting a trend
We never listen to them
It's like trying to take a piss in the wind
My home team doing visitors in, yo don't test em
They all standing close to the edge, so don't stress em
Now who the type built to last?

Yeah Illadelph, home of the original gun clappers
Out on the wrong corner your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wanting the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties running reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprising what niggas willing to do to get a neckless
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waiting in the wings ready to D
Thirst decise or need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times they be sticking you without the gats
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse
And if it's my worst bar then I'm a take it right back nigga

Yeah, it ain't nothin' like I rush I get, in front of the band
On stage wit the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform, from aynonomous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin'
I'ma flame some, sentence the shit, the cold twist to slang
Thicker than big boy baby, mom, sister pain
Beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here Geffen Records, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga black ink, red was a G financial
We finna have the whole industry at a stand still
See me put the system on lock like can pill
So get wit them endorsements, and call reinforcements
Cause my click come a full sizable portions

Cause you never met brother nothin' like me yet
So push another slice into your toast and tighten your vests
Cause it's a warrior you seein' here tonight in the flesh
I give you somethin' high voltage double dosage
Runnin' with these vultures givin' me ulcers
Which one of these hustlers bringin' the thunder
'Riq Geez not another man takin' us under
Nigga please which Philly cat doin' his own thing
Might say black my give you a code name
Round my neck see the microphone hang
Have your lady lips singin' like on soul train

The Colonel, Captain, Lieutenant, General Sergeant
Black, one man army move in on your squadron
You sittin' still you know you a target
You heard you better duck down!

The underdog knuckle and brawl with the bigger ball
I spit what your wig absorb sicker than sycamore
I'm creatin' a circumstance that you a victim of
The rebel or the renegade out on the quest
The super black man runnin' wit a S on his chest
And stand for the straight struggle to escape the stress
You think it's sweet tryin' to eat, you ain't taste this yet
So make y'all steps precautious into the darkness
Thoughts cold and heartless makin' me nauseous
Gettin' more remorses for what I done
If the lawyers and courts wonder what I run
You see the liberty is free but just for some
How you a gangster and you scared to bust your gun
For the call, trust your fam' and trust nobody at all
Seein' brothers gettin' struck down
You better duck down!

A gladiator in a colliseum ready for war
That old timer holdin' his revolver set to blow
Just like a gladiator at whoever stick his head in the door
And one who been through it all, anything go
Rather give it to you straight 'stead of speakin in codes
'Cause man, that bullshit can get you riddled with holes
If you ain't insured than the hospitals is close
You got to go up-town while ya leakin' on the ground
In cases like these, you need to duck down
You're five dollar toys, I'm a million dollar man
Esquire 'Riq Geez go according to plan
I'm thinkin' outside the box, off the blocks
An outside your concept of time, off the clocks for real
Well it's Black Thought your boss DJ
However you brothers weigh that's what ya gonna pay

But save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors

You know the stakes is high we in the face of drama
That's why we can't shake it or escape the problem
Its like a game of roulette the barrel revolving
They only want to see us occupying a coffin
Mothers crying too often from they lost child leaving
From trying to get over, get under, get even
Get inside getting, getting dumped, getting greedy
We got to get it right

You better pull you goggles up, it's about to get greasy
Believe it's on as long as we can still speak freely

that the O.G. flow, it could fuck with you head
And the police know that the green black and red
too strong to con-trol, they study what I said
Dig it - my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin' that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way - I'm a MONSTER!
You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit
Been a long time comin', I was caught in the scramble
of cats, tryin' to do the same thing that they man do

They never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them

Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin' in spirals

They shut shit down before the law start shuttin'
Get your route right cousin - be out nightclubbin' relaxed
And want to get lights out tonight brother, perhaps
It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic
For some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit
Some cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it

And be there when the shit hits the fan
I hope y'all out there understand
Look man it's a fucked up job, but somebody's gotta do it

Yeah y'all, ideal for a lyrical perfectionist
Raw, that's what every soldier in my collective is
Thought, control level is that of a gold medalist
My level headedness make it come off so effortless

The rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish
Back setting it with the answer to your deficit
My track record is hot shit, consecutive
Smug, I got game just like a record executive

A kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen
A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling
Bet on Black
Bet these cats that's all gelatin

Will fall back spittin' them raps that's unintelligent
Raps that cap, rabid rattlin' out the gattlin'

And y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands

Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -
So I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different
Gifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell

They'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell
Before there was ain't hard to tell
The mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well
Since a minor I walked with the spine upstraight

I learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
I scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks
'Cause in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots

Will get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box
Fox logo if your fave is local
Get bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo
This is work niggas

I made it - ain't nobody believe in me
But this rap game is like selling coke legally
Ain't no innovations - that takes concentration
nigga's celebrating not knowing the time they wasting

Rip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric
Shit they play on radio's now give me a headache
Can't slow me down I know where I'm headed

The profit on kill if you let it

want to rumble - guns will come out
Here come the paramedics

Tired of my people failin'
We all sin - the devil, what di I tell em

I'm puffin this Cohiba mami coolin' her heels
All she ever seem to do is play it cool f'real
She be pushin', pop vessel, and her shoes is ill
But her hand, keep slippin on the woodgrain wheel
But it's cool, we never slippin' when there's moves to make
Especially when what we talkin' ain't ya usual cake
I pump bass for y'all bathin' apes, to get charged
Nah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large
We in the wind with the roof back, lettin' the breeze hit us

Go up against enormous odds
Wouldn't break a sweat, money make her bet
Funny son you threat, well I ain't shakin' yet
Twenty-fo'/sev' chillin', tougher than penicillin
From the block where the crooked cops killin' like a villain
Children, in the hood gettin' rocked by they buildings
And brothers, 'cross the board gettin' knocked by the millions
The stress, got me ignitin' the potent marijuana leaf
Tryin' to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
You feel the music know I'm over there probably
Pimpin on the same system that forever shorted me
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
It make you want to make a new dance up
It's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff
It's not another sound system rockin steady as us
And it's cool

They never ride past me, they really comin' at me right
They want to know where the drugs guns and cash be
Probably want to get me to run, so they can blast me
Just, blast me in your box, play my shit
I know it's crowded at the top, cause I'm on the tip
And that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get
And how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset
But it's fine, re-gizzlin' I'm back for mine
In case y'all gettin' tired of the same ol' shine
And I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned
The way I'm operatin' what is a surgery of rhyme
It's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames
I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James
Hip-Hop is out of Hustleville, comin' for change
I exercise 'til a muscle build, breakin' the chains

Sky's the limit so you know I'm gonna rise and shine
I gotta do my thing, I'm kinda getting a little tired of all that's hidden
That's the reason I'm a speak my mind, keep from going insane
Now work with it, we in the last innin'
The world keeps spinnin', my peoples steady losin' while the rich keep winnin'
It's like we neva smilin' and the devil steady grinnin'
Killin' what we representin'
Even our children and women, 2K4, livin' above and under the law
Young teen joins the marines, says he'll die for the core
Inducted up into the government's war as if the land of money and oil
Funny how ain't none of it yours
I can't sleep yo I'm paranoid, it's code orange
It's far from right, I guess that's why it feels so wrong
To see the world get stripped out of every resource
And people pray to Coca-Cola now instead of the gods
What's goin' on?

Why

Keepin' your head above water, hustlin' to survive
Some people chasin' a dream, others just chasin' a high
Some people blind leading the blind, they chasin' a lie
Some people chokin' backs broken barely makin' it by
But still they workin' all they live, they pushin' for the light
Givin' everything they got to stitch them swishes on ya Nike's
Puttin' pockets on our jeans, mining diamonds for them rings
Rewarded with small change and bullets in the brains
And it makes me feel strange everything we take for granted
At times I feel stranded on this planet of mine
Now should I pull the hammer, clap it out, and laugh about it
Or stand up, be counted while I cast my ballot
When the undertaker's busy and the prison's is crowded
People livin' in fear because they vision is clouded
But the sky's the limit, I ain't cryin' you a river
Gotta move me a mountain, I'm a git up and shout it

Why?

When I dream it's hounds on my heels gainin' momentum
I'm tired, can't get uninspired or quit runnin'
I can feel they only inches behind, I escape, I survive
Some how I gotta decide how much I want it
Or is anybody listenin' without a pot to piss in
If I disappear I wonder if the world will know I'm missin'
Who my support system, it's not the court system
Gotta letter it said that you're not avoiding prison
People 'neath the microscope 'cause we defining the culture
They smile and insult you like you shinin' their loafers
Them old heads say we need a modern day Moses
When the leaders is posers we needing some soldiers
It's the X generation, the anger is a nature
Got the writing on the wall so clear that I can taste it
Like a kid sniffing glue somewhere trying to escape
Cause we vulnerable and naked
Gotta show 'em we can make it

You can keep your problems
I hear your opinion
And yes we've got 'em
Somebody's trash is somebody's treasure
Somebody's laugh is
Somebody's pain
Somebody's loss is somebody's gain
It don't matter what car yo drive
Or whatever sound you like
It don't matter if you're praying to God
Or trusting mother nature's strife
What's true to you and I maybe
Won't be right for another kind of life
Can't we agree to disagree and we can be happy

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are

We should be able to say what we think and make love at the end of the day
We should be able to step out out of sin and fall back in our own kind of way
It's ok if you don't wanna see, it's ok if you disagree
Just reach inside of yourself and realize that we're one of a kind
And all that you are is just fine know that you're you and I'm me
Free to fly
Free to fall
Free to learn, love and lie
It's up to you to live
If you don't know what to do with yourself, just breathe

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone

We are who we are
Love us or move on
Don't you know that there's a star guiding everyone
We are who we are
Love us or move on

The Roots,"Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me 
That's the way it is, when ya gotta be 
Indeed as I distort I proceed, I need 
Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom, in my room at the Ramada 
Four tanks in your memory banks to fill up 
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe 
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit 
Because my click'll make a motherfucker sick 
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix 
[It's Bob Powers] With the snares and kicks to fix 
Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-why 
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer 
With air smooth, takin' niggaz loot with dice 
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic 
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles 
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five 
Foot seven, inches in height 
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights 
Ridin' in, like lightning 
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently 
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements 
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter 
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around 
Saturn like rings and brins swings when I sings with bass 
Then distort up in your face like mace 
Bustin your dreams, I gasp with loaded magazines 
I'm on the rap scene, re-color fellas like a vaccine 
As I, rocks from under blunderin' I'm not, lyrically 
Ya getm, shot, get caught so distort with thought, for real 
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly 
Money makin' move fakin' I isn't 
Niggaz can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite 
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin' what is it 
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night 
[Malik be, get on the mic, get on the mic] 
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song 
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone 	 

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary 
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries 
Words and hers like some cattle in the steeple 
People, there's no equal, or no sequel 
SO policies, of equalities, get abolished 
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished 
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged 
Together, damn it's quite clever, however 
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like 
These, troops, who be's, Roots 
Insult ya, mellow of culture, rhythmical vulture 
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra 
I make MC's dangle like a bangle 
Strangle from every angle, my lingo hingles and it jangles 
Under Kangols, nahh them niggaz don't want to tangle 
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango 
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure 
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure 
Baby, you say you maybe, then come in to flex 
Now you wonder what's next",Distortion to Static [Black Thought]
The Roots,"Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long, you busted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere

Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear

You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin' like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin' to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be

'Cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin' my wife to be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Why'know what I'm sayin' my peoples in the place, let's hit it off, one two

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

Yo, it's like nothin' changed, it's all the same thang
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game

The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whisperin' 'bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face

And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings

Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap [Incomprehensible]

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for
[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real 'cause these memories is photographic

Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm trippin' on acid tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso

Spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lotta fights rollin' with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room the think, and space to ventilate

Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place
I got to go

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right
We got to give you more of what you're lookin' for

Here's what you want right, here's what you need right

Ladies and Gentlemen 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Yo, adrenaline 

Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm where the pressure's on 
And MC's are dressed funny like a leprechaun 
I chop rappers like chicken suizceiun 
Send a squad off like a slave auction 
Yo my zodiac sign read caution 
On stage, I'll make your seed to an orphan 
Yo, my agent have to break equation 
Niggas want some? I hit 'em with a portion 
Son of fifth foursome, armed at the door, son 
In milita, Dice Raw quick draw, son 
You don't want no more son? That's when more come 
And drag a nigga Eerie avenue to Oregon, you're all done 
Ladies and Gentlemen, select a weapon at the gate 
Upon enterting The Roots' instruemtalin' 
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit 
We hit 'em like The L on 60th and Market 
South Philly click will hold it til a nigga park it 
Take sneaks, chains and rings and braclets 
Split back, just like we the therapist 
Adrenaline, fifth mic terrorist 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

Nigga, nigga, niggas tryin' to get a grip 
Bu still slip, so lift me up 
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt 
You get to know me, you'll poke me slowly 
When caught fussin' 
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't 
Punked 'em with the dozen 
The pellets all in they skellet 
Transform from the norm, start the brainstorm 
Yeah, Malik be	 from The Roots, he ain't gone 
I took the wrong exit, the sings to lay on 
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls 
Shouts to armour and ??? whose name Jahlil 
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand in 
Demandin', taking you back like Knots Landing 
And Ralph Cramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton 
Yo, what what what what what what the...? 
I get wicked on this concrete earth until I rot 
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet 
But still I rock once again 

[Chorus] 

Beans passed the mac and we held 'em, like hostages 
Rappers see me hide they face, like ostriches 
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages 
Under water rap, you know who the bosses is 
North Philly, baby, that's where that raw shit is 
You get blown out the sky once you get talkin' it 
Hey, take the vibe raw, I fathered it 
And when you see me on the street don't bother kid 
Just be on your merry way or you might get slit 
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did 
Lay you on floors like you gettin' carpeted 
You need a special kind of mic, for retarded kids 
Me against you's like Kang vs. The Partridges 
Want to battle? change your name to the forfeiters 
Cause that's what you do, faced to face with raw niggas 
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

They used to talk shit, but I'm a quiet 'em 
Kick in the door with my boys, stick to fryin' 'em 
First nigga that flinch, I'm a fire him 
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plyer them 
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em? 
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in 
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em 
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him 
Paid a front row seats, watchin' Iverson 
First class air crash when I'm flyin' in 
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them 
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them 
Used to shotgun in cars that I'm drivin' 'em 
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em 
Run all up in yo' spot with Rob and 'em 
Grew up, two-four, with Pry and 'em 
But do my dirt, twenty first, with Kyle and them 
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them 
Brother knews, nigga schooled Marly Park and them 
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em 
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them 
Tore their body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em 
To sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em 
These Illadel' foul streets when I'm stompin' 'em

The Roots,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless

If you use it you can fly

I fly higher than them dudes from off ya block

Now next time greedy stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lackluster
Gotta put it to ya straight 
Y'all fools is jacked up

Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars

Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in a capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though,
I get in the zone, recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology, fraud or tricknology
Just trust what I see and I say and follow me
My way, I be the open book, look inside me
The star of the story that the grooveteller guide me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the true gon' sense it

That the O.G. flow, it could fuck witcha head
And the po-lice know that the green black and red
Too strong to con-trol, they study what I said

Dig it - my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way - I'm a MONSTER!

You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit

Been a long time comin, I was caught in the scramble
Of cats, tryin to do the same thing that they man do
Eagles born to fly, real is made to ramble
""A Dangerous Mind,"" I'm a prime example

They never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them

Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin in spirals
The wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral
Could be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you

It ain't really bout nothin - Philly just love cuttin
They shut shit down before the law start shuttin
Get your route right cousin - be out nightclubbin relaxed
And want to get lights out tonight brother, perhaps

It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic
For some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit
Some cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it
But move to the music he can live through the record

With tension runnin' deep as the ocean
Many are called, but so few are chosen
As I go through the motions, of medication uppin my dosage
Bangin' Earth, Wind & Fire ""Devotion"" as I admire the focus
Takin' the city with a grain of salt
Where they tastin' foul, chase it down, with the latest malt - liquor
Roll and hit it, knife did it, hope you got some smarts wit'chu
Hope you got some heart it ain't no stoppin' when it start, nigga
Feel somethin' bigger got a hold on me
And I ain't trippin' not a Bobby Brown, lippin' with my nose runnin'
Basically I had two, options I just chose one
And then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted
Coast to coast, from L.A. to Chicago
Now I'm faced, with the weight of survival, plus the taste
From the way I been lied to while the preacher man spittin' his gospel
I can win if I try to

I'm tryin'a get a piece of this government green
And smack 'em in the melon with another LP
C'mon, help a couple people in the struggle get free
We from the block, where people stay prepared to rock
And it's hard, 'cause opportunity be scared to knock
And mo' people in the 'hood found dead from cops
Than guns that drop, that sprayed off random shots
But what'cha know good, people say they in the hood fo' good

Can't Stop This, I want my peoples to rock this

Legs and users, 'bout as a deep as my thoughts is
Sit back and I'mma paint you a portrait

This shit can have you exhausted
Just, picture the planet and imagine it's yours, kid
Don't ever let nobody knock you outta your orbit

Can't have that, because here come, the city of Philly
Put an end to all the trivia, really
Where I'm walkin' everybody ain't pretty or friendly
It's work, my whole life they ain't give me a penny
Comin' up between a rock and a hard, watchin' for God
People, hip hop, and with no option at all
Yo, it's how it's goin' down

Thought's pen is sharp enough to be considered a crown

In front of an audience that never been pleased
I'm comin' from all the streets that never been cleaned
And speakin' for any faith that never been seen
This debeneir style of my words is high-caliber
Speakin' my mind for every day that's on the calendar
Cause I'll'a been quiet, about as long as I can handle it
Walked a mile in these boots that I'm standin' in
Mellow soul brother with his lyrical dean on
The stages I'm seen on, mic I fiend on
When it's all full of soul, that's when it means more
I never hesitate to give a shoulder to lean on, yo
Check it out, man

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I came to y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they Can't Stop This (stop this)",Can't Stop This
The Roots,"Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears
Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grass
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the car, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your man's goin' get up and stop with no yams
All it take is one break, it could pop the program
Whether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sentenced a lot
I feel some brothers is beginning to plot
It might have been a close friend I forgot
Who started up and ain't remember to stop
I bet these niggas going remember the shop

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, I'm like Malcolm out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
Need it from the horse's mouth or from my eye with less account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Haters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
People locking their doors, clutching to their crosses
The block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices
So what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left
I watch my back, and watch my step
And I might forgive, but I will not forget come on

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, living in turbulent times
The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind
Your sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison
My man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand
He just attracted to scam, he right back in the can
I never sleepwalking, you dig
You get your shuteye
I'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
But fin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an energy
Half telling me nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
To many parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge
And every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown

The Roots,"It don't feel right, don't feel right, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?
Something don't feel right out here

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman
And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing
My main adversary any silly concoction
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing clear
It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, children working, weapon producing
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all got to make that living
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free
If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me

It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
It don't feel right, it don't feel right

Downtown Philly where it's realer than a heart attack
It wasn't really that ill until the start of crack
Now it's a body caught every night on the Almanac
Rock bottom where them cops gotta problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at
I had nothin' but I made somethin' outta that
Now I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack
From 215 it's him the livest one
And he's representin' Philly to the fullest
Blacks the realest
You can't touch him and not for nothin'
If you bout hip hop then you gots to love it
If not then fuck it
I'm still handlin'
Smokin' more reefer than Redman and them damaging MC's
And my name's Rick Gees you endangered species
For what I do I'm about to up the fees
I'm paper-chase motivated I ain't the one to play with

I'm about ready for a classic massacre
I'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa
Jump outta a black Porsche huffin' a fat cigar
Night ridin' on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff
Voted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full
Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves
All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
And put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep
Cause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell

My instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe

So if you into sight seein' don't visit there
It's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware
Philly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there
Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryin' to get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga's head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence
To you old self you've lost any resemblance
They say the city make a dark impression
The youth just lost and they want direction
But they don't get the police, they get the protection
And walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit

It's kind of a thrill, my mind it will spill, my nine it will kill
Of course bro like crossbow, I bring the force though
Hittin' your guts splittin' your torso
It's colder than the North Pole livin' unlawful
I'm giving you a jawful Of somethin' awful
Yo my theoretic is leaded, Will come and set it
The shit bang and leave you diabetic for paramedics
I spit flames and get dames to get change
With pit bull bark and lock the shock
Don't bother me Och, don't you dare lie to me Och
I don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Och
Benefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout
Big shit, send it for route and finish him out
Joints stiff from rigor mortise
While we swimmin' in waters, women with daughters
Will have us niggas sinnin' with orders

From the time you in the bar gettin' high
To havin' conversations on your phone through the wire
You can drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
Livin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe
From the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me
I couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me
Maybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically
How niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy
No benefit of doubt he had to be from

Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin'
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin' your head boppin' and all

Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter

But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at

Can't take it outta him really

For crack to make it happen

And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino pullin' paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin' the floors
And runnin' to stores
But all those old heads
Would talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip

Spine tingle elevating every singular hair
All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
Where the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Chain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's submerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers

Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

Flash light, red light, proceed ahead right
Straight into them headlights, you get your head right
Head right get a third strike, hit the turnpike
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Make you wanna holla 'bout it
It ain't no doubt about it
Every now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it
And I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count

Raw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls
Some of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar

Raise up time to lift off
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board

Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial 
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way the getting is on
The cost, dealing with this you only taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And go with the one who breaking you off

Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholics are really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all 
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll
With the one who's breaking you off

Rolling down the highway
Listening to Sade sing
""The way the smooth operator move my way""
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?
We breakin' down like we grove dogs pulling a hike
You making sounds like a vive got you reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength 
That its attraction girl
Workin' with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one 
Who's breaking you off

Baby, baby, baby, don't you worry bout
Nothing 'cause I'm coming to handle you
Whenever you want, that thing you need, I got it
I'm there and I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you

You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mountain into grands of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The desperado, that refuse to follow
The Fifth afficianado, break you up into parts like vibrato
I deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back and forth the same

With hammers on their waist, yeah, waste rare niggas
And I race scared niggas, them snake head niggas
That take care of niggas who don't break bread with us
Niggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas
Brown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas
No telling when the bullet coming, be prepared niggas
Cause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas
That's everywhere niggas, Am I the motherfucking legendary?
Yeah niggas, make it very clear niggas
Been looking at y'all in my rearview
Mirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas
I'm the definiere nigga, a bear taking more than my share
Lookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga
Neither is a bar even with a hair trigger
Haystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga
Leave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet
That don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga
I'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga
I'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga
I am such a fair nigga, you in a battle telling
Me you not ready like you figured I'ma bear with you
I don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds
Of the money making jam trillionaires nigga
Gentlemen of an extraordinary league
You never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
What I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed
Your boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry
As a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green
We tried to launder the cash and never came clean
So now I'm in the story with all the cats before me
And smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame
The train to the buck, did another dang plan
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint, I'm a modern day kane
My definition I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand
It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your zanny, work your set, work it down
What's your net working plan? You better look alive
Cuz them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga
And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hitting
I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall? I ain't heard of that
Y'all niggas is off the wall like Aresnio Hall
I'ma put you right back where the dirt is at
450 Fahrenheit on the thermostat
Somebody starving like a white girl runnin' that
But she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work,
Not earning that, the black microphone murder vet
I'm in a class of my own,
If I got beef with you, you the last one to know
I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already international-able
I done toured to Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring
My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone
Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on
Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm
You been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate
I'm a rebel, renegade must stay paid",75 Bars (Black's Reconstruction)

Monday they predict the storm
Tuesday they predict the bad
Wednesday they cover the grass
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

[Black Thought]
Look, it is what it is
Because of what it was
I did what I did
Cause it does what it does
I don't put nothin' above
What I am, what I love
My family, my blood
My city and my hood
Hater for the greater good
I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick
Though, I know I probably should
But, what I'm doin' is not a good look
I never did it by the good book, as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's gettin' old on me
But still somethin' gotta hold on me
Maybe it's faith
If it's comin', yo I'm willing to wait
I'm not runnin', I done ran through the mud
I done scrambled and such
I done robbed an odd job and gambled enough
Till I'm put up in handcuffs
And pissin' in a cup
If there's a God,
I don't know if he listenin' or what

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Yeah, it is what it is
And that's how it go
Get treated like a criminal
If crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga
If a nigga saw your show
A public enemy, to send a eye in the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishin' for a raft
And prayin' that hope flows
Some real f'ing things going down low so,
Who lookin' for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here
Screamin' ""fuck the mayor""
He see the faces at the bottom of the welfare
They act like I'm somethin' to fear
Trapped in urban warfare
And pullin' triggers at a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild
That's drawin' 'em near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off
Still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah

[Chorus]

[Saigon]
Who wanna challenge mine?
I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes
That's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spittin' them sentences
To senseless experience is the difference
You can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen
Still livin' but gettin' benefits
Put emphasis on hittin' my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that
Remember nights I used to sleep wit a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack and raid me
It took a week for that
Beat the rat, but you're sayin' ""look, he think he the mack""
Fuck yall!
Niggas who thinkin' they might try us
Watch us inside riots
Blue cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus, cops rush to brutalize us
America's polluted by lust
Who could I trust?
If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you
Then fuck you!

All on the red carpet, guns from the black market

I've been down but now I'm back up
Bout to act up boy you better back up

I crack up when a rapper gets slapped up
Number one reason yall should give rap up
Dice it's mine, I got it all wrapped up

I'm used to the one two check not the one two step
Um strapped I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!

My head already so heavy its making the scales tip,
I got my own pressure and got everyones elses,
I'm rehabilitating and still feeling rebellious,
Candidate of heart failure more pills than Elvis,
In a layer cake, half chocolate half velvet,
I'm listening to some howe Melvin,
I got so many options theres so many toxins yo,
Didn't really tell what we killing ourselves with,
I lit a cigarette and then held it,

Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To prisons that mixed in to the wrong crowd,
My life is on a flight that going down,
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child,
With the time I felt loved, thats gone now,
Thats replaced with purples rays some storm clouds,
Misery love Misery, so why make friends lets make enemies,
An now I got a habit thats wasn't meant for me,
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be,
One more reason to change identity,
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties.

Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Foul smells around them pells in the alley and
Corner filled with teddy bears, cause they killed a child again,
They sing about murder, so it ain't a song it's hollerin'
Get off the choir with your soft attire,
Niggas out here don't give a fuck, cause they lost desire

[Talib Kweli]
My city's full of heart breakers and stargazers
Who puff gosh vegas
So they gone with the wind, like Clark Gable,
Breathin' like Darth Vader, believin' in dark angel
Yeah, we got flags, but they not star-spangled
We not patriotic, the heroes are not them,
Ghetto griots like rims, you stop, they still spin,
Tall tales at the bar, witnessed after dark,
And we still stop in and chicken and brown timbs
And listen to Rakim
With the where that y'all been
For realla, I hadn't been schemin' or plottin'
You fear us? Fear is self, personified
Payin' homage to homicide
Prayin' to the dollar sign
It's idol worship
The rebel forces
Bodies lie at the foundation of the fortress
This is war, we expect some losses
And we comin' for the heads of the bosses

[Chorus: x2]

[Black Thought]
We on some casualties of war shit,
What you stand for, kid?
We in the city where they definitely lost it
You open your eyelids and capped in the ribs
Your funeral they have your 12th grade portrait
Pretty corpse in casket, bell-shaped orchids
Said he 19 and left a self-made fortune
And left three orphans
Now he in a box with the same chain and watch
That never came off him
It's a shame what it cost him
Where he come from it ain't nothin'
It's a everyday thing, that's a problem
It's chambers revolving
Bustin' like Russian roulette
With a full set, then change what the odds is,
Flames in the mosque, and
People held hostage
Everyday I struggle, try to get up out the mosh-pit
Homicide for profit, tell me how we not sick?
This shit is out of control, they can't stop it

Entrances exits vestibules and alleys
Winding roads that test the firm nerve
Fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
The engine oil purr lights flash to a blur
Speed work through the earth make your motor go scurr!
Tonight at noon watch a bad moon rising
Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds
Blindin' staring at lights till they cryin'
Bone gristle popping from continuous grindin'
Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass
Ingredients influential on your ways and acts
Zero tolerance to raise the tax

Do not shake I'm workin' while the boss relaxin'

You know I'm hip to it and its hard to claim the land
When my great great great grands were shipped to it
Look at technology they call it downloading
I call it downsizing somebody follow me
Does a computer chip have an astrology
And when it fuck up could it give you an apology
Could it
Should it say hello or should it say goodbye
Try to understand how smart and how hood am I, It don't matter though
Until we learn that the world don't turn right ,we all oughta the scatter though

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying

She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that
The radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it

The crown ruler is back
He congruent to the shape of a mack
Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back
This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just makin' it hap
To all the frauds stop fakin' relax
And to the broads if you cakin'
Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back
I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that

And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less

I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it
We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen
And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics
But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin'
So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin'
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it.
They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin'
This is the trial and error era no co defendant
I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it
I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga

Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh answer me what kind of question is that
I'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap
And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics

Days are living fast, moves in misery

Sing another song, singing man

Sing a song for me

[P.O.R.N.]
Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?

Yo, She said she was a magazine editor named Jenning 
Backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
Probably had the most devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen
She had sumthin' to hide she snuck in from outside 
And got everybody gassed like the car I drive
With all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe
She said she came to see them roots boy fallout live
But listen,

Verse 2 [Black Thought]
You see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
I talk to a woman, he mind more steady 
Probably something in the way they designed just more steady
I just let you recite cause the line so heavy
But I shoulda known better cause now I feel like America's underbelly 
R. Kelly got a smart better less, internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist 
You trying to send me to the therapist

Verse 3: [Black Thought]
Now she told me cheddar cheese grits 
Two tomato fried fish 
Cause she heard its my dish
Tryna be my sidekick 
All the people all around thinking she was my chick 
Saying DAMN the girl thick 
But she ain't no twenty-six
Looking at me like am up to sumthin' on the funny tip 
Like I ever been the one to honey jib
Its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
In fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me

If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand

'Cause them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga

And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver

You late, I'm already international-able

I done toured to Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring

My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffle I'm gone
Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on

Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest

Trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings, and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm trying to do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is livin' life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage when the sky's the limit

You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck

Yo, when you on the corner, it's too much drama
Livin' with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother

It's too much lyin' and too much flyin'

When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Out on the streets where I grew up (how I got over)
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck (how I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to care

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people countin' on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world; I'm not frontin' like it isn't
There's no time for comin' up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'm-a raise the bar though like Bridgette
See every star go; don't blink--you might miss it
It's precious cargo--you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types; be more specific
Shit, I'm Blackthought--what could be more prolific?
For this love I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond the gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hit list, it's 'bout business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it; right on

Gym stones, niggas copyin' shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion that I hop, the new star to hit
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm Heaven-sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverent for what I represent to show my benevolence
This is Dilly; I'm reppin' for the art of the city
Came from Southwest Atlantic and gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry 'cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shootin' up the club like they party with Diddy
You pick the diggy; I put my incandescence to fluorescence
And an essence I convert with (?) for energy per second
I put 'em on the lessons while I'm smokin' on a pleasant

The Roots,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Web 20/20 [Edited]

The Roots,"When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'm-a get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never, now or never, now or never)

I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain
Tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change
Finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done
My head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page
To start acting my age and part ways
With black thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase--bygones is bygones?
Niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this mid-life kind of crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now, but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead--which is my look-a-like now
I'm moving ahead

[Chorus]

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew 'em
On the sunniest days of my life I cried through 'em
Mom's was out the picture and pops I barely knew him
And I would pray to God, but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam' and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?
My mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
I know my good and bad needs both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role was cast before I even auditioned for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reclamation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering
You can go ahead throw the towel in
'Cause, nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the lights
Like (?) it's the end of your life
And I'm out

[Chorus]

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feels like there's something else far off in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger take and leaving less of me
I can't fight it now; I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in (?)
Or will it just start bringing out the best of me?
But is the best of me really just the worst of me?
And if so yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinners' court it's important to have church with me 
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I feel that change is an absolute certainty
'Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain

What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit

The Trail of Tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For the working the bone like my name Robert Dion
I go above and beyond--the duty called truly, y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Asked me if I'm just another muli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on; it's a mission I'm embarking on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, 
Like how she kneeled and prayed
Willin', master forgive us, 
Our trust pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin' that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of forty nights and forty days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings 
But a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, 
To the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, 
Soakin' before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin' to move out of the dark, 
And closer to the light

Cause we see, so much pain and misery

You can make things change
Oh if you just take a stand, yeah yeah

You've got to believe in yourself, in all that you do
You've got to fight to make it better, better
And you will see, that others will start believin' too

The Roots,"You know you ghetto boy, when you got a face, with a scar
And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car
Shorties pull out and bust, like a money shot
Now he on the run, he hot
And he hurtin' his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin' to find a sunny, 
Spot-light, they caught him at the 
Stop-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But instead, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin' to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms, chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficulty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
Can, good, and bad co-exist?

Though I'm the type to bare arms
And wear my heart on my sleeve

Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but
We're more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters

And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us

The Roots,"I drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story never read at all
I’m better off looking for the end
Where the credits are
It’s a pain living life against the grain
I’m looking back and y’all look the same
Troy, Mark, and little what’s his name
Memory is rerunning it all
It’s the flight of my fall and it’s right on the wall

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you?

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I used to ride the train to the same two stops
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playing on the jukebox
Joint called “Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox”
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can’t be forgotten like old acquaintances
I realize how depressing of a place it is
And when I notice my reflection whose face it is

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was

It’s only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles’ heel
A leopard can’t change his spots and never will
So I’m forever ill
Now I can never chill

When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
Sometimes it’s as cut and dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still",I Remember

Stars are made to shine

I’m in the double G, three-piece tux
Screaming dressed to kill
Hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house, sipping on a royal flush
Two queens is on my cuffs
Good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time
I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think
How do you find this upper echelon this time
Let’s toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yo, I’m never sleeping like I’m on methamphetamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers
Rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide right pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I’ve got em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the lime light or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line tight

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like hornet
Damn it felt good to see people up on it

You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka
You pick your poison down Davey Jones' locker
It's rum we be wanting
By the tons my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver
It's disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror
We start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing the punches
Me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding water starts receding
A feeling comes into my heart I start believing that
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive my own thoughts of suicide that's competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far you can't reach ‘em
And it feels like there's no one

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves
And even blood is lost
Where did it begin
The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath
Now I am better off
There without a trace
And you in my head
All the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done till you dead and gone
The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
I'm not even breaking out in a sweat
Or cold fever but
I'm never paying up on my debt or tolls either
I'll leave the memories here I won't need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom
Your body's part of the Maritime museum
Face down in the past is where I'm bein'

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean

It's what it seems..
Well, in the world of night terrors it's
Hard to dream, they hollerin' cash rules everything
Just call it cream, cause when it rises to the top
You get the finer things
Oceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks
And saying grace over lobster and steak
Like please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
Cause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my)
Make my (make my)
Departure from the world

Tryin' to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish
Feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway

If too much money talking

Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a
Kam-I-Ka-Ze pilot
We wilin' out of control until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y’all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best
I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away
I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest
But once you’ve had the best better ain’t as good
Weak heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like the samurai
The street’s Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck
I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash and grab
And where my party people y’all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, Now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line un-rhymed

You ever wonder what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time
What’s the big deal, why do they feel
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky and if I’d ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then drive in head first like the jack knife
Cause out here, yo you niggas can’t belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the sub prime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Then through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets
A life of high crime
To make it to the bottom
Such a high climb

Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time

Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell I’m gonna make an entrance

Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more

Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying cold blood hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I

Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to breaking the law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose
Get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got

The Roots,"Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I’m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It’s unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves",Sleep
The Roots,"It’s about flesh and blood
It’s about a heart beat that beats strong
It’s about s passion
That is unyielding
And I want you men to know today
It’s your time
It is your hour
It is your moment
Go take it

Yeah speaking of pieces of a man
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter I’m leaving for my fam' but
It’s written in language they will never understand
A late repentant
Never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned
The wheels spin, I’m looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen
Was this a matter of flesh and blood
Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose
Yes it does
It ain’t about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence
What is it back to the essence of
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of
Cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular
But how far am I ahead of ya
It just as easily could'a been me instead of ya

We gone fight till we can’t fight no more
You can't fight no more
You gone lie down and bleed a while
You gone get up
And fight some more
Want you say it with me
Repeat it after me when I say it
We gone fight

Fuck getting fucked
Immaculate conception
Now what’s beef ain’t even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape
Flirt with death every night it’s a blind date
One night stand paybacks a bitch
Shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss
Blood sweat and tears broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth
Blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat
Daddy should’ve let me be a stain on the bed sheets
I’m one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like welcome to my world
I’m an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time I'ma keep it one hundred
Don’t play chicken when I’m driving them crazy
Get hit in the wing thigh breast or drumstick

Same as yesterday
Oh that's right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce

For real for real I feel like
Cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that grow another here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like casper what the fuck do I know

At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lies
You got to pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl

Yo, the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
I damn with animal anguish
So love no bitch die richer than language
Guilty of sin depending on the reeds shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here looking for its end

At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lies
You got to pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong

Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak
I'm an AK you down the street

Money bag, nice swag, pockets need an ice bag

Niggas lose their lives sad
Rockets in their flight path
Breaking bad, make them bad
Choices out here thinking fast
Smoking wet and drinking bad
Soaking wet and sinking fast
Shoot them niggas making cash
Stick them niggas take their stash
The law of gravity meets, the law of averages
Ain't no sense in attempting to civilize savages
Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment
I'm a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison
We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing
No idea how much time's left, fuck trying to cherish it
A life in times unchecked, now that's American
Inherit the wind, pressure in everything

The world ain’t ready for someone like me
And life is sex, stress, drama and I’m hookin out 3
I’d rather O.D. than be the next O.G
Than fronting for a whore that already chose me
One man revolution that’s supportin prostitution
I’m trying pimp the game, where balling don’t mean hooping
And riding don’t mean cruising
It mean keep your bitch-ass moving
If you ain’t built for bruising, redrum ain’t in your blueprint
In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji
On Easy-E and PCP, ass-cash or EBT
How you monetize pigeons on a power line
On a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign
I don’t mind, I don’t mind, long as all the smoke is mine
And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns
And I heard that def-ass caller money’s on the other line
The last episode of Good Times is my life

‘Freeze’ they say in the streets when the young players
Get rich or die trying
But the funny thing about that phrase to me
Is that these little niggas be lying
Cause don’t nobody wanna die
But everybody trying to get rich though
But the fucked thing about that
These lil' niggas don’t how to get rich so
I still run with those angels
Man I still P for those angels
Speaking with guns, sticking in tongues
Talking that Arabic and that Yiddish
Riding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles
Yeah I play for those gangsters
My tag on the wall, you niggas look up
You can still see my name yo
How did I end up where I’m at?
It’s kind of hard to explain yo
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans too
Crossed that bitch, then I got that bitch
Now all I want from her’s an abortion
My mind filled with distortion
My eyelids say caution
Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back
They say it’s gonna cost a fortune
And I wonder if the lord take debit?

But I know my head is surrounded by clouds
Spirallin' down, destined to drown
Forever is just a collection of nows
Off on my own, nowhere is my home
Approaching infinities fork in the road
When I was young something I often was told
It's not a bargain if it costs you your soul
Costs you your pride, caution aside
I'm gone with the wind and I'm long for the ride
Wish I could rest and open my eyes
But time ain't finna fly down from the sky

Not another soul's there, only us

Still covered in dirt from working on his farm
Theres an old faded calender
From Johnsons hardware store
Still says July nineteen fifty four 
Theres a piece of that ladder
I climbed where he couldn't see
I smoked my first and last cigarette
And i turned john deere green
No he never told momma
When he caught me he just laughed
And said son that won't make you a man

Today the sun was shining as the family gathered round
Teardrops were falling as we laid him in the ground
But i knew where i could come to be with things close to his heart
Theres a lifetime of memories
In grandpas barn

I rolled back the cover
On his long white cadillac
At ten years old he let me steer
Sitting there on his lap
Theres a picture of grandma
That he kept in the dash
An old 8track
His favorite Johnny Cash
In a corner of his tackroom
Underneath his cross
Theres a worn out Holy Bible
The one that saved him when he was lost
It said remember son
You've got to get down on your knees
And thank God for the blessings you receive

And I went from A to Z;
I took out every pretty girl in town.
They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you.
No girl who is in my little red book,
Just ever could replace your love,
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of.
Won't you please come back to me?

Of the drunks in the street
And I can hear when they're playing their lovesong

Of your hair when it falls down
From the pillow late at night
On the brink of illusion

All along with their family awaiting the sea

And his arm like plants torn from one another

As if it would lead to foreign ground, my friend,
And he likes to dream about the worms, my dear!
Swept in his blood - all the flowers are kept in his coffin
Oh, the dread you can see in their eyes
As he tells them to praise all their black fear.

He says: ""Hospitals, you're just a kidney,a uterus, liver and blood, dear.""
Talking to God, you're just souls with a body - a dirty machine to wear

Beat the drum, oh restless son,
Dancing in your coffin they will claim your past.
Paint his face, they say, he was my love!
Dancing in his coffin he beats the drum

Won't show

Why don't you just go away

An' you showed me the town
I thought you were kind of nice
But if someone stepped in
With more to show
You'd drop me without thinkin' twice
You tie yourself to my apron strings

Oh tiny bud, that grows in the womb
Only to be crushed before you can bloom

Stop, turn around, go back, think it over

And if so 
Will you still continue 
To be on my side 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (Tell me, girl) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

I was so 
Insecure with you 
Did you still want me 
So I let go 
Of the feeling that you 
Were still all mine 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (Show me that you care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

Must we both 
Go on being confused 
And placing blame 
My heart knows 
That you're my number one 
Do you feel the same way too 

Tell me 
If you still care about me (If you still care) 
Tell me 
If you still care about me 

Yes, I know 
That I still love you 
You're forever on my mind 
And it's so hard to let go 
What I feel for you 
You've blown my mind 

And captured all my love with your sweetness 
And I gave it to you, baby, from my heart 
So if we really care for each other 
Tell me, baby [Tell me], why are we apart

If you still care about me (If you still care) [Do you really care?]

If you still care about me (You're forever on my mind) 

Tell (Listen to my heart beat) me 
If you still care about me about me 
Tell me (Tell me)

If you still care (Listen to my heart beat)

I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right

And then it starts flowing through me
From my feet right to my head
Then I scream calling out your name
I want you back in my bed, my bed

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Like a drummer always beating the insides of my soul
Hidden feelings always seeking
The touch they knew so well in the places that matter

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
I can't eat, I can't sleep, thinking about who you're with
Are you happy making me crazy? You were the best I ever had
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?

The pain of too much pleasure is all so clear to me
After you go nothing but ache to fill my emptiness
Emptiness, emptiness

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
