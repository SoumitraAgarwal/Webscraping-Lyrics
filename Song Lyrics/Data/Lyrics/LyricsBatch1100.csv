Pulp,"This is our ""Music from A Bachelor's Den""
The sound of loneliness turned up to ten
A horror soundtrack from a stagnant waterbed
And it sounds just like this.
This is the sound of someone losing the plot
Making out that they're okay when they're not
You're gonna like it
But not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh, baby
Here comes the fear again, oh-oh
The end is near again, oh-oh
A monkey's built a house on your back
You can't get anyone to come in the sack
And here comes another panic attack, oh
Here we go again

So now you know the words to our song
Pretty soon you'll all be singing along
When you're sad, when you're lonely
And it all turns out wrong
When you've got the fear

And when you're no longer searching
For beauty or love
Just some kind of life
With the edges taken off
When you can't even define what it is that you're frightened of
This song will be here

Oh, baby
Here comes the fear gain, oh-oh
The end is near again, oh-oh
If you ever get that chimp off your back
If you ever find the thing that you lack
But you know you're only having a laugh, oh
And here we go again
Until the end

Until the end

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh",The Fear
Pulp,"Come and play the tunes of glory
Raise your voice in celebration
Of the days that we have wasted in the cafe
In the station
And learn the meaning of existence in fortnightly installments
Come share this golden age with me
In my single-room apartment
And if it all amounts to nothing
It doesn't matter
These are still our glory days

Oh, my face is unappealing and my thoughts are unoriginal
I did experiments with substances
But all it did was make me ill and I used to do the I Ching
But then I had to feed the meter
Now I can't see into the future
But at least I can use the heater
Oh, it doesn't get much better than this
'Cause this is how we live our glory days
And I could be a genius if I just put my mind to it
And I
I could do anything if only I could get round to it
Oh, we were brought up on the Space-Race
Now they expect you to clean toilets
When you've seen how big the world is
How can you make do with this?
If you want me, I'll be sleeping in
Sleeping in throughout these glory days

These glory days can take their toll
So catch me now
Before I turn to gold
Yeah we'd love to hear your story
Just as long as it tells us where we are
That where we are is where we're meant to be

Oh, come on, make it up yourself
You don't need anybody else
And I promise I won't sell these days to anybody else in the world but you
No-one but you
No-one but you
No-one but you
No-one but you",Glory Days
Pulp,"Help the aged,
One time they were just like you
Drinking, smoking cigs and sniffing glue
Help the aged
Don't just put them in a home
Can't have much fun when they're all on their own
Give a hand, if you can
Try and help them to unwind
Give them hope and give them comfort
'Cause they're running out of time

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover, baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

Help the aged
'Cause one day you'll be older too
You might need someone who can pull you through
And if you look very hard
Behind those lines upon their face
You may see where you are headed
And it's such a lonely place, oh

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover baby
Teach you stuff although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

You can dye your hair but it's the one thing you can't change
Can't run away from yourself, yourself, yours-s-s-s-self

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away.
When did you first realize?
It's time you took an older lover, baby

Pulp,"Laid here
With your advertising sliding past my eyes
Like cartoons from other people's lives
I start to wonder
What it takes to be a Man

Well, I learned to drink
And I learned to smoke
And I learned to tell
A dirty joke
Oh, if that's all there is then there's no point for me, oh

So please can I ask just why we're alive
'Cause all that you do seems such a waste of time?
And if you hang around too long you'll be a ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-an
Tell me about it

Your car can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-an

So you stumble into town with your stomach in
Show 'em what you've got (though they've seen everything)
Yeah, you're a beauty, but they've seen your type before, oh

You've got no need
But still you want
To go and book
That restaurant
The wine will flow
And then you'll just fly away, yeah

So please can I ask just why we're alive?
'Cause all that you do seems such a waste of time

Pulp,"Don't bother saying you're sorry.
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes, again.
Every time I get no further.
How long has it been?
Come on in now,
Wipe your feet on my dreams.

You take up my time,
Like some cheap magazine,
When I could have been learning something.
Oh well, you know what I mean.

I've done this before.
And I will do it again.
Come on and kill me baby,
While you smile like a friend.
And I'll come running,
Just to do it again.

You are the last drink I never should drunk.
You are the body hidden in the trunk.
You are the habit I can't seem to kick.
You are my secrets on the front page every week.
You are the car I never should have bought.
You are the train I never should have caught.
You are the cut that makes me hide my face.
You are the party that makes me feel my age.

Like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid.
Like a plane I've been told I never should board.
Like a film that's so bad but I've gotta stay til the end.
Let me tell you now,
It's lucky for you that we're friends.

Pulp,"Hey, man
How come you treat your woman so bad?
That's not the way you do it
No, no, no, you shouldn't do it like that
I could show you how to do it right
I used to practice every night on my wife, now she's gone
Yeah, she's gone
You see, her mother and me
We never got along that well, you see

I'd love to help you
But everybody's telling me you look like me
But please don't turn out like me, you look like me
But you're not like me I know
I had one, two, three,
Four shots of happiness, I look like a big man
But I've only got a little soul
I only got a little soul

Yeah, I wish I could be an example
Wish I could say I stood up for you
And fought for what was right
But I never did
I just wore my trenchcoat and stayed out every single night
You think I'm joking?
Try me
Try me
Yeah come on, try me tonight
I did what was wrong though I knew what was right
I've got no wisdom that I want to pass on
Just don't hang round here, no, I'm telling you son
You don't want to know me
Oh, that's just what everybody's telling me

And everybody's telling me you look like me
But please don't turn into me

Pulp,"I used to try very hard to make friends with everyone on the planet
I've seen you havin' it, havin' it, yeah
But now you've just had it

Entertainment can sometimes be hard
When the thing that you love
Is the same thing that's holding you down

This man is dangerous
He just shed his load on your best party frock
Before you enter the palace of wisdom you have to decide

Are you ready to rock?
Hmm, can you party with me?
Can you show me a good time?
Do you even know what one looks like?

And I don't need to hear your stories again
Just get on the floor and show me, show me what you're made of
Just what exactly are you made of?

(Baby, you're driving me crazy)
(Baby, you're driving me crazy)

I was having a whale of a time until your uncle Psychosis arrived
Why do we have to half-kill ourselves just to prove we're alive?
I'm here whenever you need me, whenever you need me
Well, I won't be here

And have you ever stopped to ask yourself?
If you didn't come to party, then why did you come here?
Why did you come here
Baby, you're driving me crazy
Baby, you're driving me crazy

And do you really want to know
Just how come you turned out so dumb?
When the party's over, will you come home with me?
When the party's overn will you come home with me

When I close my eyes, I can see you lowering yourself to my level
I don't know where you got those clothes
You can take them off if it makes you feel better

No, I don't know know
No, no, no
No, I don't know

I open my eyes and you're there
Even better in the flesh, it would seem
I'm so ready and willing and able it's untrue
To act out this love scene
And make my dreams come true
And how many others have touched themselves whilst looking at pictures of you?
How many others could handle it if all their dreams came true?
I don't expect you to answer straight away
Maybe you're just having an off day
But I need to believe in you
Yes I do
Yes I do

I know you're feeling the same as me but what you gonna do about it?
Now here's an exclusive
I've wanted you for years
I only needed the balls to admit it
When the unbelievable object meets the unstoppable force
There's nothing you can do about it
No
I will light your cigarette with a star that has fallen from the sky
Breathe in, breathe out
I love the way you move
Don't let anyone tell you any different tonight
You are beauty, you are class
You showed it all, but you still kept a little piece back just for me
A little piece back just for me

Can't you see what he wants to do?
He thinks if he stands near enough then he will look as good as you
Oh, he don't care about your problems
He just wants to show his friends
I guess I'm just the same as him
Oh, I just didn't know it then
I never understood you really
And I know it's too late now
You didn't ask to be that way

Pulp,"Without you my life has become a hangover without end
A movie made for TV
Bad dialogue, bad acting, no interest
Too long with no story and no sex

To wish the day would go away?
Like you did yesterday
Just like you did yesterday
And I can't think of a way to get through this pain
To be happy again, to make it all alright
And I know it must be bad, 'cause sitting here right now
All I know is I can't even think
I can't even think of anything clever to say
So I say
Why pretend any longer?

It's obvious that I miss you so much

Look at all these buildings & houses

Hey now, slow down a minute. 
Take my arms & fill them full of life.

Does it ease the pain of being alive? 
Or is it why - why you keep nodding out on me? 
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe out. 
Another day, another major disaster
I love my life. I love my life. 
You got a problem. 
I lost my keys when I stayed at your place. 
On the floor of your living room, you made the scene but it'll never get shown on TV. 
So tonight prepare to kiss goodbye to my lovelife. 
So get this right- I love my life; it's the only reason I'm alive. 
It's mine, all mine - as long as I don't forget to breathe. 
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe out. 
Corny I know, but you had better believe it

That's right: you've got to fight to the death for the right to live your life.

Pulp,"""There's a light that shines on everything & everyone. 
And it shines so bright - brighter even than the sun"". 
That's what Minnie thinks as she walks to meet her brother, 
Who is nearly two years older, on a Saturday night. 
He's DJ-ing at some do on the edge of town on the night 
That Minnie Timperley died.

It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl. 
So much that you want to try, the world wants to sleep with you tonight. 
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life.

How can a girl have sex with these pathetic teenage wrecks? 
Football scarves, the girls drink halves & her brother's crying 'cause he has lost his decks. 
Outside the air was cool, an older guy sitting in his car asked if Minnie needed a ride. 
He thought he was still dangerous - paunchy, but dangerous -
On the night that Minnie Timperley died.

It's such a beautiful world, you're such a beautiful girl. 
And he only did what he did 'cause you looked like one of his kids. 
But Minnie, Minnie if I could I would give you the rest of my life.

Your hair in braids
Your sailor top

In my hotel room

To piss-poor, but all that's gonna change. 
Because here comes sunrise. Yeah, here's your sunrise. 
I used to hide from the sun, tried to live my whole life underground. 
Why'd you have to rise & ruin all my fun? 
Just turned over, closed the curtains on the day.

Yeah, the trees, those useless trees produce the air that I am breathing. 
Yeah, the trees, those useless trees; they never said that you were leaving.
 
I carved your name with a heart just up above - now swollen,
Distorted, unrecognisable; like our love.

Are the incense at the funeral procession here, today.

Pulp,"We came across the North Sea with our carriers on our knees
Wound up in some holding camp somewhere outside Leeds. 
Because we do not care to fight, my friends - we are the weeds. 
Because we got no homes they call us smelly refugees. 

We are weeds, vegetation, dense undergrowth. 
Through' cracks in the pavement: there weeds will grow

Weed.",Weeds
Pulp,"This is the true story of the weeds: the origin of the species.
A story of cultivation, exploitation, civilization. 
Found flowering on wasteland unnoticed, unofficial, accidental. 
A cutting was taken but weeds do not thrive under hothouse conditions & wilt when in competition with more exotic strains.
A charming naivety, very short flowering season; 
No sooner has the first blooming begun than decay sets in. 
Bring your camera, take photo of life on the margins. 
Offer money in exchange for sex & then get a taxi home. 
The story has always been the same
A source of wonder due to their ability to thrive on poor quality soil offering very little nourishment
Drinking 'Nurishment'. 
But weeds must be kept under strict control or they will destroy everything in their path. 
Growing wild, then harvested in their prime & passed around at dinner parties. 
Care for some weed? 
So natural, so wild, so unrefined & someone's gonna make a fortune one day
If only they can market this stuff right.
Come on: do your dance. 
Come on, do your funny little dance. 
Germination. Plantation. Exploitation. Civilization. 
A sensational buzz - zzzzzz.

Pulp,"Just behind the station, before you reach the traffic island, a river runs through' a concrete channel. 
I took you there once; I think it was after the Leadmill. 
The water was dirty & smelt of industrialisation
Little mesters coughing their lungs up & globules the colour of tomato ketchup. 
But it flows. Yeah, it flows. 
Underneath the city through' dirty brickwork conduits
Connecting white witches on the Moor with pre-raphaelites down in Broomhall. 
Beneath the old Trebor factory that burnt down in the early seventies. 
Leaving an antiquated sweet-shop smell & caverns of nougat & caramel. 
Nougat. Yeah, nougat & caramel. 
And the river flows on. 
Yeah, the river flows on beneath pudgy fifteen-year olds addicted to coffee whitener
And it finally comes above ground again at Forge Dam: the place where we first met.

I went there again for old time's sake
Hoping to find the child's toy horse ride that played such a ridiculously tragic tune. 
It was still there - but none of the kids seemed interested in riding on it. 
And the cafe was still there too
The same press-in plastic letters on the price list & scuffed formica-top tables. 
I sat as close as possible to the seat where I'd met you that autumn afternoon. 
And then, after what seemed like hours of thinking about it
I finally took your face in my hands & I kissed you for the first time 
And a feeling like electricity flowed through' my whole body. 
And I immediately knew that I'd entered a completely different world. 
And all the time, in the background, the sound of that ridiculously heartbreaking child's ride outside.

At the other end of town the river flows underneath an old railway viaduct
I went there with you once - except you were somebody else - 
And we gazed down at the sludgy brown surface of the water together. 
Then a passer-by told us that it used to be a local custom to jump off the viaduct into the river
When coming home from the pub on a Saturday night. 
But that this custom had died out when someone jumped 
Landed too near to the riverbank 
Had sunk in the mud there & drowned before anyone could reach them. 
I don't know if he'd just made the whole story up, but there's no way you'd get me to jump off that bridge. 
No chance. Never in a million years.

Yeah, a river flows underneath this city
I'd like to go there with you now my pretty & follow it on for miles & miles, below other people's ordinary lives.
Occasionally catching a glimpse of the moon, through' man-hole covers along the route. 
Yeah, it's dark sometimes but if you hold my hand, I think I know the way. 
Oh, this is as far as we got last time 
But if we go just another mile we will surface surrounded by grass & trees & the fly-over that takes the cars to cities.
Buds that explode at the slightest touch, nettles that sting - but not too much. 
I've never been past this point, what lies ahead I really could not say. 
I used to live just by the river, in a dis-used factory just off the Wicker 
The river flowed by day after day
""One day"" I thought, ""One day I will follow it"" but that day never came
I moved away & lost track but tonight I am thinking about making my way back.
I may find you there & float on wherever the river may take me. 
Wherever the river may take me. 
Wherever the river may take us. 
Wherever it wants us to go. 
Wherever it wants us to go.",Wickerman

Pry the lid open on you
But you manage to lie low
You depose the reign of truth
Claim not to be my foe
You creat my emptiness 
With false ambitions
It's hard to live alone in

So justify conformity

She was an air force wife 
He used to fly weekends 
It was the easy life 
But then it turned around 
And he began to change 
She didn't wonder then 
She didn't think it strange 
But then he got a call 
He had to leave that night 
He couldn't say too much 
But it would be alright 
He didn't need to pack 
They'd meet the next night 
He had a job to do 
Flying to Cambodia 

And as the nights passed by 
She tried to trace the past 
The way he used to look 
The way he used to laugh 
I guess she'll never know 
What got inside his soul 
She couldn't make it out 
Just couldn't take it all 
He had the saddest eyes 
That you have ever seen 
He used to cry some nights 
As though he lived a dream 
And as she held him close 
He used to search her face 
As though she knew the truth 
Lost inside Cambodia 

But then a call came through 
They said he'd soon be home 
She had to pack a case 
And they would make a rendezvous

And not a single word 
And all the love she knew 
Has disappeared out in the haze

Welcome aboard the Underground Railroad, I'm your captain
I'm gonna explain the reason why I keep on rappin
Why I keep on movin, doin shows in Manhattan
Knowin in my heart, that I'll probably never go platinum
See it's for the love, music is in my protoplasm
I can only wish but I don't have a genie and my name's not Aladdin
Fasten your seatbelts, we're takin off soon
I'm gonna rock rock on, on a rocket to the moon
Start a label up there, sign an alien rappin clique
Sell a million units, and get paid in amethyst
Cause on this planet, reality doesn't exist
You'd rather sell souls than to sign some real shit
But I refuse to put it in park so I'm shiftin the gears
Even though time flies, I'm 28 in years
That's about 10 thousand and 2200 months
Spittin heat for ten years and haven't been signed once
How I'm 'sposed to blow up, when independent labels front
Don't pay up, don't promote, your record label sucks
You got MC's out there that deserve to get put on
So for them, I'm gonna rock rock rock on

At first, I wanted to paint, so I went to art school
Then I saw heads rappin, bangin on tables in the lunchroom
In a cypher, they were playin some hot beats
And these heads rappin was C-Rayz Walz and Mobb Deep
Yeah - I went to school with them dudes
And they dropped out, and eventually I did too
I formed a crew with a group named Doom, they call 'em Hydra now
And they even sound liver now
So me and Blitzkrieg, now we got Park Slope on lock
That's when I battled, this Puerto Rican cat named Block
And we battled, he beat me, I was impressed with his flow
He saw potential, so we broke bread and smoked 'dro
This ain't fake, trust me this is a real tale
Block had a group called Zooty Zoo and introduced me to Will Tell
We did a track with Medaphoar and shit clicked rapidly
Then Block said let's form the Brooklyn Academy
So we did, kids flipped, they loved our songs
We were like Pink Floyd, Run-D.M.C. and Cheech & Chong
Then Black Panther Marco Polo came along
So now we gon' rock rock rock rock on

I rock for Brooklyn, Park Slope, that's my home
I rock for the brothers on lock gettin chopped for the phone
I rock for the b-boys and the DJ's
I rock for MC's and writers, catchin tags on the freeway
I rock for my dad and my uncles, rest in peace
I rock for my grandma Isabel who's also deceased
I rock for those who died, and those who are alive
I rock for my mom and sis they helped me to survive
I rock for my wife, she brought our son in our life
I mean it so sincere that I'm sayin it twice
I rock for my wife, she brought our son in our life
I rock for him like when I rock him to sleep at night
I rock for the Ak, my family, in these dark days
I rock, for y'all, like I rock for The Plague

Punch Brothers,"The leading lights of the age all wondered among themselves what I would do next,
After all that I'd found, in my circles around the world, was there anything left?
""Gentlemen,"" I said, ""I've studied the maps, and if what I am thinking is right,
There's another new world, at the top of the world, for whoever can break through the ice,""

I looked 'round the room, in that way I once had, and I saw that they wanted belief,
So I said, ""All I've got are my guts and my God,"" then I paused, ""and the Annabel Lee.""
Oh, the Annabel Lee, I saw their eyes shine, the most beautiful ship in the sea,
My Nina, my Pinta, my Santa Maria, my beautiful Annabel Lee

That spring we set sail, and the crowd waved from shore, and on board the sailors waved caps,
But I'd never had family, just the Annabel Lee, so I never had cause to look back.
I just studied the charts, set the course north, and towards dark I drifted toward sleep,
And I dreamed of the fine, deep harbour I'd find past the ice, for my Annabel Lee.

After that it got colder, and the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night.
And the sea turned the colour of sky turned the colour of sea turned the colour of ice.

After that all around us was vastness, one glassy desert of arsenic white,
And the waves that once lifted us, shifted instead into drifts against Annabel's sides.
And the crew gathered closer, at first for the comfort, but each morning would bring a new set
Of tracks in the snow, leading over the edge of the world, til I was the only one left.

And as the going got slower, colder and colder, my crew drifted closer to me,
At first for the comfort, but then it was more like the icebergs rammed Annabel Lee
As the floes shrieked her hull, the shouting began, and a mast snapped off in the wind,
And I woke up much later, my crew disappeared, and they never were heard from again

After that it gets cloudy,
But it feels like I laid there for days, or maybe for months
But Annabel held me, the two of us happy,
Just to think back on all we had done

I told her {We talked) of the other new worlds
We'd discover as she gave up her body to me,
As I chopped up her mainsail for timber,
I told her of all that we still had to see.
As the ice {frost} turned her moorings
To nine-tails and the wind lashed her sides in the cold,
I burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold.

I can't {won't} call it rescue,
What brought me back here to this old world to drink and decline,
Pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine.
But sometimes at night, in my dreams,
Comes the singing of some unheard tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep,
Thinking Annabel Lee's finally made it to the top of the world.

Yeah, sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of some unheard tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep, thinking Annabel Lee's finally found another new world.",Another New World

Your new rhymes couldn't fuck wit' none of my old shit
To any emcee that comes out his mouth
I give your shit to the bootleggers before ya come out

You only sold a few units, 'cause of your guest-stars

I learned and mastered the art of war

Name your favorite rapper
Yea I know about him
I heard the whole album, its hot, but no value
Chill out, battle, don't do it
We the nicest, there's are other things I haven't included
Like
We tight nothin' less than that
I know you wish this rap was your reference track
And next to that
You' hype ''cause the spotlights on you
That's quite normal
When Words'll write for you

[Punchline]
Right on you
Lyrically keep it tight for you
I switch to plan be	, if the plot foils
Fuck the hoes, gimme dough and mo' fame
Spit the flow till I blow like cole-trane
why'all know, name
We, Punch & Words
Those beats with the keyboard sounds, irk my nerves
Any battle I entered, never got served
If I should die tonight these be my last words

Punchline,"I try to find the words to say to you but I can't find them; so I'll just keep my mouth shut. I can't say what will make you go way because I don't want you to leave. But I can't see you and you won't hear me. I can't hold you anymore. To my surprise I open up my eyes and I hear your voice and I hear your lies, but I still want to be the one you dream about when you're lying in bed and you scream and shout that I should have been the one that was there and you should have been the one that cared, but I guess its too late and we're on bad terms but I've got to admit that it still hurts. So here I am again always stuck in this situation, I guess you could say that I messed up. If you go, I don't know if I can handle being alone.

Punchline,"Wait...I said, underneath my breath as she turned away from me. Never did I see the look in her eye because her back was turned to me. Maybe if I had seen a tear drop in her eyes I would have stopped I swear I would; but I kept pushing her to love me but I didn't know that I was only pushing her away from me. Maybe if I hadn't chased her to the door, then maybe she would have come back for more. All that I can say is if only, maybe if I quit saying maybe all the time then you'd be back and you'd be mine. Now I'm lost. I've been down this path before, but it hasn't been a while. I sit here and just think, about my life and how I never seem to win. Constantly not smiling because of a stupid girl, who I only want because she doesn't want me. Isn't it funny how life always works out, works out when you'd least expect it to.

And leave me behind suppurated sores

Minimal skinning can be an effective technique

Use a little plier

Start slicing off bits of muscles

Amputation may be a great punishment technique
Beware of too fast mutilation

Cutting off a limb

Slice away his lip

Before pull off his nails
And cut off his toes

Pur,"Mein Kartenhaus ist wieder eingestürzt
Weil der Wind von mehr als einer Seite kam
All die Farben sind jetzt übermalt
Mir bleibt ein schwarzes Loch und eine Hand
Wenn ich sie hebe, wird sie schwer wie bleibt
Oder sie fängt an, etwas neues zu bauen
Ich weiss, ich könnte, wenn ich wollte
Doch wollen können kann ich nicht
Mir fehlt der Mut mich zu trauen
Hinter mir zerschmettert Glas und Porzellan
Vor mir zerspringt der Spiegel
In dem ich mich sonst sehen kann
Und ich steh' bebend mitten drin
Aber noch lebend mitten drin
Zwischen den Scherben - wohin?
Ich mach' die Augen zu und lasse mich fallen
Ich hoffe, jemand fängt mich auf
Ich dreh' mich I'm Kreis mit verbundenen Augen
Bis mir jemand die Richtung zeigt
Do bist da und streichst mir übers Haar
Do fängst mich auf wie warmer, weicher Sand
Do beatmest mich mit allem, was do bist
Ich spür' die Kraft zurück in meiner Hand
Wenn ich dich so spüre
Dann kommt die Welt zum Steh'n
Mit dir zusammen könnt' ich
Barfuss durchs Scherbenmeer gehen
Und die Wunde heilt mit der Zeit
Doch do und ich erleben zu zweit
Trotz aller Scherben zu zweit
Ich mach' die Augen zu und lasse mich fallen
Ich weiss, do fängst mich auf
Ich dreh' mich I'm Kreis mit verbundenen Augen
Bis do mir die Richtung zeigst
Do machst die Augen zu und lässt dich fallen
Und do weisst, ich fang' dich auf
Do drehst dich I'm Kreis mit verbundenen Augen
Bis ich dir die Richtung zeig'
Do machst die Augen zu und lässt dich fallen
Und do weisst, ich fang' dich auf
Do drehst dich I'm Kreis mit verbundenen Augen
Bis ich dir die Richtung zeig'
Mach' die Augen zu und lass dich fallen
Mach' die Augen zu und lass dich fallen
Mach' die Augen zu und lass dich fallen

Pur,"Wo sind all die Indianer hin,
Wann verlor das große Ziel den Sinn?
Dieses alte Bild aus der Kinderzeit
Zeigt alle Brüder vom Stamm der Gerechtigkeit.
Wir waren bunt bemalt und mit wildem Schrei
Stand jeder stolze Krieger den Schwachen bei.
Unser Ehrenwort war heilig,
Nur ein Bleichgesicht betrog
Und es waren gute Jahre,
Bis der Erste sich belog.
Wo sind all die Indianer hin,
Wann verlor das große Ziel den Sinn,
So wie Chingachgook für das Gute stehn,
Als letzter Mohikaner unter Geiern nach dem Rechten sehn.
Der ""Kleine Büffel"" spielt heute Boss,
Er zog mit Papi's Firma das große Los.
""Geschmeidige Natter"" sortiert die Post,
Und in seiner Freizeit sagt er meistens ""Prost"".
Und die Friedenspfeife baumelt über'm Videogerät,
Wieviel Träume dürfen platzen,
Ohne daß man sich verrät.
Wo sind all die Indianer hin,
Wann verlor das große Ziel den Sinn,
So wie Chingachgook für das Gute stehn,
Als letzter Mohikaner unter Geiern nach dem Rechten sehn.
Es gibt noch ein paar wenige vom Stamme der Schoschonen,
Die finden sich, erkennen sich am Blick,
Und deren gute Taten kann man nur durch Freundschaft belohnen,
Sie nehmen ein Versprechen nie zurück.

Pur,"Hier oben, wo die Luft am dünnsten ist
Wo nur Mut nicht vor Angst die Augen schließt
Ist der Traum vom Fliegen so erfüllbar nah

Die langen Bretter, die die Schwingen ersetzen
Gesetze der Schwerkraft zu verletzen
Der Schanzentisch als großes Katapult

Als ein Spielball aller Winde
Selbstkontrolle nicht zu verlieren
Außer Kopf und Kragen
Möglichst doch nicht allzuviel riskieren

Das Können und das Wagnis
In die Hocke - gleich soweit
Und der Puls rast mit nach unten
Zum Absprung bereit

Adler sollen fliegen !
Adler sollen fliegen !
Die Adler sollen fliegen -
Weit und hoch und frei !

Zu können, was kaum ein anderer kann
Dafür alles zu geben von Kindesbeinen an
Bis nach oben, in die Tiefe geradeaus

Mit Schweiß und Tränen jeden Zweifel
Mühsam weggewischt
Mit Erfolgserlebnissen
Körper und Seele neu erfrischt

Der oben auf dem Treppchen steht
Ist der, der sehr weit fliegt
Was wirklich bei der Leistung zählt
Ist der innere Sieg

Adler sollen fliegen...",Adler Sollen Fliegen [Album Version]

ich streife die gewohnte Haut ab
und fühl´ mich wieder nackt
wollte doch nur kosten, aber hat so gut geschmeckt
bin abgehoben, losgeflogen
hab´ gar nichts mehr gescheckt

Bahn frei, es ist nie zu spät
ich bin viel zu jung
he do, geh´ aus dem Weg
bin nicht mehr allzu jung

das oben war bald innen und das unten war bald kalt
alles gab es zu gewinnen doch dafür gab´s kein Halt
ich flog aus stumpfen Zonen ohne Lücken I'm Netz
in herzliche Regionen ohne Auffangnetz

doch do gibst mich nicht frei
zerrst an meinem Herz
und do ziehst an dem Seil
das uns verbunden läßt

laß mich endlich fliegen
kapp die Nabelschnur
denn Drachen sollen fliegen
ohne feste Spur

die Luft ist süß und streichelt
die schlimmsten Schmerzen weg
ein Blick in deinen Spiegel zeigt
ich brauche kein Versteck

Bahn frei, was sein muß muß sein
lenken kann ich´s nicht
he do, ich muß da durch
bevor zu viel zerbricht

Sah viele umfallen, ich blieb meistens steh´n


Viele 1000 Momente in die Zeit gerafft
Ich wünsch mir noch mehr davon, mehr noch
Hab besser kapiert, was mich glücklich macht
Was mich echt nicht kümmern muß, na was?

Wir kosten nun Nerven,

Der nicht mal angefangen hat
Das Frühstück steht da wie verlor'n
Nicht angerührt
Und do bist durch die Tür.
Spür' die Träne I'm Gesicht
Laß es kommen
Wehr' mich nicht
In mir drin ist es so leer
Warum ist ein leerer Kopf so schwer?
Und der Traum
Mit dir alt zu werden
Scheint ausgeträumt
Schmilzt wie Butter in der Sonne
Und der Tisch wird abgeräumt.
Es tut weh - wie beim ersten Mal
Es tut weh - einfach jedes Mal
Es tut weh - heut' ein bißchen mehr
Weil ich weiß
Alle Tränen der Welt
Und Versprechungen
Die man eh nicht hält
Bringen dich nicht mehr her.
Wir wollten alles und noch mehr
Doch daß es so zu Ende geht
So ganz gewöhnlich
Tut am meisten weh.
Do stehst vor mir und fragst mich: Wie heilt man Gefühlslegasthenie?
Ich weiß nicht mal
Wie man das schreibt und sage nur:
Es tut mir leid.
Und die Tür fällt ins Schloß
Und all die jahre sind um
Das ging alles viel zu schnell
Ich weiß nicht mal genau

Der gerne hilft
Den man auch gerne kennt
Sie war noch zuversichtlich
Nach dem ersten Befund
Und sie glaubte und hofft
Denn es gab keinen Grund
Von Gerechtigkeit hielt

Und sinnlos ihr Ziel

Die Schmerzen vergeh'n
Die Tränen vergossen
Das kann keiner versteh'n

Doch was auch geschieht
Sie lebt in Gedanken
Und in diesem Lied

All die Therapien

Die kraft zu entzieh'n
Doch sie wollte kein Mitleid
Mit Löwinnenmut
Oh

Als ging es ihr gut
Ich sah sie und weinte

Valentine's Day will never be the same

How come men nowadays bring you so much joy
And so much pain
Can anybody help me?
I think I'm going insane
Valentine's Day will never be the same
'Cause I think about you always
I cherish everything you gave to me
I'm thinking of

Roses that you sent to me
All the kisses that you gave to me
Memories of what we used to be
All alone this special day
Thinking 'bout the time you went away
Valentine's Day will never be the same


You took my love for granted
Then you mean to think that
Everything was fine between me and you
Everytime this day comes around
I wanna feel your touch
I can't believe what you did to me
I hate cha, did me wrong
But still I must move on

I gotta move on, ooh oh

Purity Ring,"You were young and you'd start
With a reverence incurred
There was an echo far and faint
Beneath the air remained
You were young and you'd stare
Where my limbs hung far and fair

You push and you pull and you tell yourself no
It's like when you lie down, the vein's growing slow
You push and you pull but you would never know
I crept up in you and I wouldn't let go

There was no light and I swear
I could see a rearing fear
I heard the planes moaning back
I saw the thunder roll or black
There was no light and I swear
We sat still in our fear

I build a constellation lair
Out of the moles that hovered there
A fever billowed with the wind
And I obeyed the sky therein

[Movie Quotes Intro]
Well this is the effect, all these films beginning ???
The kids are very impressionable.  Three?
They see all these films and they want to imitate their heroes.
What heroes though?
All they see is robbers, rapists, muggers, and murderers.
I'm impressed, you're a killer.

[Mr. Lif]
Yo
The plans' covered in asphalt
The Lord told me that its man's fault 
For perpetuating detrimental ways of living we can't halt
Everything inside ya move
You're caught inside a homicidal groove
Where only the idle loose
By violating one of life's most vital rules
Thou shalt not
But hell is a foul spot, where many are misinformed when they are taught
And thus cherish the untrue
Then die for the lies that they clung to
Del and I were there when they hung you
And as you swung to and fro 
We asked, (where did the humane humans go?)
With none in sight
We're left to focus on the same stunning fight
That spites the same force that put the sun in flight
So I summon night
The lack of light left some in fright
And living in fear
With something they couldn't bear
I promise to tell the truth and the whole truth
I solemnly swear

[Dj Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Del the Funky Homosapien]
Progression, the lesson
I figure out which direction, then jettison
Minimalize perplexion
Flesh and bone, that's just a physical
I got a spiritual
Awareness, I have risen to
Its not mystical, something that I listen to
When these plastic motherfuckers try to get in-to
My cypher, I ciphen they blood like they split in two
Yeah, Del, repel, arduous
The purest, give 'em service
With no insurance
Evil
I see through, like cellophane
Knowledge of self, that's why people see Del is strange
They want to humanize the most demonic dudes
Apply harmonic rules
Decide, who is the guy
Americas'
Just like a pair of glove
Don't want to share with us
Anarchy, tear it up

[Chorus 3x]
[Craze scratches ""three sixty degrees""]

[Mr. Lif then Del alternating stanzas]
The new era, brings terror
You wish the quality of life was better
Peep the dilemma

Yeah life's getting dimmer
Stomachs' gettin' thinner
But your souls keep you full, obesity is for sinners

The sentiment lingers
Low self-esteem hinders

I tell my people 'bout slavery, no one remembers

Maybe they ought to take a look in they mirrors

Like Michael Jackson, and they actions gettin' clearer

Beware, the imagery might scare ya

If you ain't close to the source, then you don't like prosperity

One or many waitin' in line for therapy

But everyone bear a seed
Pure as the air we breathe

Pusha T,"In the midst of negativity, a positive site can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good, seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form,
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night rich wealthy or poor with dislikes
We pray, asking for forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith
We pray
Amen

Yeah, you like that right? I wrote it myself by the way

I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin' myself

Oh, what a feelin', the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathin' in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling 
Still up on my nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm Downey fresh soft white like my kilo
Feelin' myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself

[Chorus]

Baby take a chance, never mind what you're hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell 'em what you're wearing
Shop till you drop they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions, like baby steps
We can share beginnings, walk before you run, but she so independent
That I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or no Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin' myself

[Chorus]

I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No jokers here, you can call me smoking ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin' myself

It's like a bitch you can't shake

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the seventies, I cater that
You know what fame is? Sitting with the woman
Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is? Flushing two bricks
And tryna have a nigga strain it out the drainage

[Chorus]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Grew up watching momma car repoe'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velor, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real niggas sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show 'em all love, the bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

Testarossa top models, G fours
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in

Pusha T,"I can't be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow so that my core follows
We don't mourn for the dead, nigga we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with Similac powder in a baby bottle
Yughck, the formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother, nigga I'll be damned
Gator at my momma's house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler's paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down forty but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye at it, kept a poker face
Cause the batter I added had the coca base
When you get to heaven's door they won't hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker's face
There's no feeling like your bitch chinchillin' right
You in Italian leather and you four wheeling right
You know you're up when you can count a quarter million right
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I'm a wizard at it, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel I threw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bare witnesses I unveil this instant classic

Yes, my God, my God, my God
Yes, my God, my God, yes!

Yughck the Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I'll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say the feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I'm heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The o twelve a year early, I'm a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at thirty and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They'll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
Yughck, it's the new god flow, ain't it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted

Yes, my God, my God, my God
Yes, my God, my God, yes!",My God
Pusha T,"I'm only in the company of Kings
I made a power move and it's everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of twenty thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F B I R S D E A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try and crack the code
Combination lock to the kilos that I hold
Leopard print Louboutin's, prowlin' the concrete
Roller balls come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
Thirty five large took it right out the top draw
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

[Chorus]
It's like rain, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing but we is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear, hocus pocus
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Unless he is an insomniac and dying to dream

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to them o's
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look I'm all grown up and I dun blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I'm filthy
Drop Phantom is milky
White on white, twenty four inch blades I'm skatin'
Red eye smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan 
Niggas surprised, fifty back on fire
Fifty back running round this bitch strapped
Hit man for hire

[Chorus]

I sit with the liars, duct tape and tires
Been lost their soul
They just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea dive for the fish scale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a record head back if that shit fail
Drop weight like an anchor than you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine double scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleep overs
Yeah, Re-Up gang with the G-Unit
This is Taylor made drug dealer fiend music
Test it on ya tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

Pusha T,"I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's nine one one you're on your twenty fifth hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't go by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya, yeah
Upgrade 'em, upstage 'em
Change the whole body shape and just update 'em, pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it

I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch out the rainforest
So many bitches its a blur, I take the blame for it
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I lay ? camp is vilify
As I up lift this arch for them ceiling high
I can't identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg

Better know who you is
When you looking in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters
It ain't gold
I'm getting low, from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happening
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, that ain't gold
I'm gettin low, hold me from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'

Just another day getting by, by, by

For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted one kept owing
For every bitch I showed the way it's one that kept hoe'in
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and the tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lions
The news you read can be you, ghetto law abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies you and your soul can't see it clearer

Five into ten the return of the clones
Then took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned em to Boeing's
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Lost a lot of niggas, some in club fed
Few still reminiscing in they CL,
Sellin' Pete rock cruisin' in they V twelve

[Chorus]",Everything That Glitters
Pusha T,"I see you supplyin' the strip
I'm supplyin' the hits
These niggas been fiendin' for this shit

In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares
Let the gods of the game know I'm right here
To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folk
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em
Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em
I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'

[Chorus]
I just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it
I just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it
I just wanna flip it, I just wanna sell it
It's so obvious, in my clothes you can smell it

Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it
Hit the jackpot, bullseye, dart through it
Music, I talk through it, it's an art to it
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it
Eighty cents could save a child, but I ain't up to it 
I just shop through it, cook and chop to it
Move Heavy D, I shewop to it
We got our own thing, drop the top to it
This is block music, Wacka Flock to it

[Chorus]

I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw
Here to raise the bar, chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In the two door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best getting better
Look, but can't touch, I'm a muthafuckin' leper
Q dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better
K I L I'm just waiting on a letter
Oh, there it is, let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever

[Chorus]",So Obvious
Pusha T,"It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio
Looking at a guy out here hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilled liquor 
In bars form one side of this world to the other
Than you made
You talkin' to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing
Kiss stealing, woo, wheeling dealing, limousine riding
Jet flying son of a gun
And I'm having a  hard time holding these alligators down

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mention
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I'm what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin, that's pop warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on 'em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

[Chorus]
You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I'm still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling under dressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlas applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometres all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by Peta
More Pony hairs, more Zebras
More pythons, more lizards

[Chorus]",What Dreams Are Made Of
Pusha T,"It's the blackout, 'rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, never throw up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches out with money or with ass shots
G.O.O.D had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-up gang paid a nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels
You and LV Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Pharrell said ""get 'em,"" so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game
I'm a problem cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch's lips
Mr.Lipschitz has been trippin' since I mentioned Reptar's
Triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these mutharfucks
As a musk like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bush wick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Uhm, well, not really, it's gettin' kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting' jiggy with it and Bel-Air's riches
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks ironed pair of dockers
Two Glocks cocked screamin' west side!
With the speakers blastin' a pair of pots
Yonkers ten milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'Preme wasn't free willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils
It's Wolf Gang and the

With the re-up's a hell of a buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a hell of a drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry
When you at the top of your game, you make enemies
You'll never finish me

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind",Trouble on My Mind

Money goin' in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Get money, gold chains
I don't never feel pain, 'cause I done felt too much pain
Standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I ain't never did a thing
Getting money, rocking chains
You'll never feel the same, We the? in the game
I don't never feel pain

18 wheeler, gorillas
Black with gold chains, Pittsburgh, like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords, running through this money screaming encore
Spending nights with the prime whore, but that's the bitch that you're blind for
Celebrating on a whim, nigga, pain is parked above the rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas!
'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga!
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas!
So now we're even like a hem, nigga!
Put your freedom over failure!
Tryna find my Grizelda
Might as well, they gon' nail ya!
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the feds knock at your door

I'm just standing in the rain, blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing, getting money, rock a hundred gold chains

Pain is joy when it cries, it's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling, Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain (yeah)
This is drug dealer brilliance

Pyrex on the platter like hot sex, but my tribe don't quest like love
Came in this bitch, with a mask and a glove, and a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
It's no risk without gain, there's no trust without shame
It's no us without caine
Push, my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron, Tre-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
But instead I chose Avon, colored face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup
It's a match made in heaven, all that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message

Pusha T,"Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
Younger brother me a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard
That rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burns us, ashes to ashes
Mix us with the powder, sell us to the masses
We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic
Now you celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses, Push'

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres

Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always fuck it
35 years of marriage and my momma left it
You shouldn't question if you ever stood a chance with him
The better question is did you enjoy the dance with him
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
You know this money grew your hair out, switch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Place none above me, God don't like ugly
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
Called him tar baby now he’s transcending genres
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan vs Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres, Push!

Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind

Pusha T,"I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descendant from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on",Hold On
Pusha T,"This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if it hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Call me ""daddy"" from a complex
Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking spanish like Don Omar, but

I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks

Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
When them lights on you, and them letters big
You point us out, just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress, 'cause

I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks

Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout caine copping
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best d-boy all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova, but

I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks",King Push

Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging
I ain't tryna guide you, hand on bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
30 dollar new catsuits is not cute
And 50 comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone she's just bluffin'
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing

Boy, you got that 6 in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Hey mama come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dolla' thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see through V1 V2
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
Christians or Chloe, damn them C's too
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here

Boy, you got that 6 in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you

Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
Blow it all cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin' “honey don’t ask”

Boy, you got that 6 in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want

Say hi to the bad guy, say ahhh to the champagne
Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing
(Woo!) They see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go
Representing my niggas down till they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way, aow!

Momma had me in the ghetto (ghetto), I was raised in the slums (slums)
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums (yeah)
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, they was chumps (woo)
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murder, federal escaping (damn)
Uncle got power, now I see him in another 10
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this powerless masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower (ha-ha)
Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale (scale)
Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back can't you tell? (That's right)
In the hood I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal (yeah)
Sportcars, Italian leather, Princess Cut, with piguets
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet

Super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said
Ye told me I'm outta here
Mentioned Ye two years ago

Pusha T,"20 plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby face monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm and hammer and a mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago tried to fight the urge like Ivan Drago
If he dies he dies, like Doughboy to Tre
If he rides he rides, Throwing punches in the room
If he cries he cries, we don't drink away the pain
When a nigga die we add a link to the chain
Inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playing on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills who's gone fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
Nigga this is Simon says, Simon red
Blood on your diamonds til you dying, dead, yah!

You better change what comes out your speaker

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Troubles on my mind, I still smell crime
My little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten
Back when nine ounces have got you ten
And nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
My daddy dumped a quarter piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat land on his gold
I said ""daddy, one day I'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said ""son, how come you think you be my connect?""
Said ""pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect""
He said ""well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga
Please reap what you sowed, nigga
I was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession

Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, ""it ain't adding up""
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question ""Were you man enough?""
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me; can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
""They sayin' Tarian been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home""
""Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome""
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying

Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing
Once he told me that

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me; can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!",S.N.I.T.C.H.
Pusha T,"Yeah, I just ordered one my nigga
Yeah

I’m still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I’m still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to em, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
Balance on the scale, I ain’t a Libra either
I’m just a name and number with the means to reach ya
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, him chief of
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers you been leeching
Been baller, been Jacob, been dealer
Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas you zoolander, Ben Stiller

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred, just point and give them a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Between renter and a homeowner
Hip Hop, we can cover any rolling stoner
Louboutins I heist nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers cause they in their moment
Might of crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
Don't make us equal cause we shared a bitch or two
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the bible don't burn like these bullets don't spiral
Like I can't see the scene that you mirror in your idol
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
Oh, suicide, it's a suicide
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go

You don't know me nigga, fuck out my way

Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top 5, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Story of the sheep and the wolves I un-master
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it fall like Sebastian
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, nigga brick, break down, break dance
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin

When it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes

Even if it's left overs I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes

And I'm going 'til I K.O
Eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll
Even when we role-play

Your SL's missing an S, nigga
Your plane's missing a chef

If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
King Push, kingpin, overlord
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Hard to get a handle on this double-edged sword
Whether rappin' or I'm rappin' to a whore
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-league, I'm like these clothes
'88 Jordan, leaping from the free throw

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards

(Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more)
Mix drug and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
Twenty-five bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed twenty-five more
I see flaw, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simple Simon
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us

Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch live and say I bought her Michael Kors?
Every car driven was decided by the horse
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
Thirty-six years of doing dirt like it's Earth Day, God

The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes 
It’s more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that’s above money
This the ministry of street energy 
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I’m the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it

Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It’s good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
‘Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn’t have to make a cameo to get it off

I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper

Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA

Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I’m at your door
You don’t wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow ‘em
I done laid in lawns when they didn’t mow ‘em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show ‘em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief 
It’s on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don’t duck and dodge
You can’t trust them odds

Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear

I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em

And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough

Building prisons where the mountains is

I am dreaming every moment I'll be near you

Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning

Precious memories keep-a lingering on, 
ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness,

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Finding another world.

We couldn't look you in your eyes,

The graves open up
Lifeless cadavers roam the earth
To take their revenge
Tormented souls without hope
No possible escape
A terrible fate they must lead
But they do not complain

The town sleeps most calmly
Unknowing, full of bliss
The room might reek of death
Yet they sleep in peace

Gasping for a final breath
Awoken savagely
Staring in death?s cold eyes

Torture and let bleed slowly
These are the dead
Arisen from eternal sleep
They are the sleepwalkers

Not a scream, not a sound
Lungs ripped out of sleeping bodies
The art of silent slaughter
They want nothing, but to harm
Get revenge on the human race
For all its evils

Torture and let bleed slowly
These are the dead
Arisen from eternal sleep
They are the sleepwalkers

As warm blood hits the ground
Life leaves drop by drop
Nothing left but an empty carcass
To one day join the sleepwalkers

Sleepwalkers of the night
Eternal and forever there
They will not stop killing
Until we are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs
We are theirs

I'm wit whateva comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain on day to day
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, tech's, jimmy hat's, in case I need protection
So I land cruise, play I want to be's
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me
So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't want to get wet, so they step
Cause mine's is slighty bigger
But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't want to talk
I stay true blue, I'm hopin it's you too
I got the fever for the flava of a??????
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus: 1x]

[Verse 2]
Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep it sight's
Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's own tonight
I'm doin the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T.
But it's home, so I flex, get pressure's off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next
Stomach ache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie
Get a final call for the brother in a bow-tie
I'm from little kid's, dream, and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playin wit her son
I pass by a girl wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray their's a hood in heaven
Fake brother's claim their's no shame in they're game
You know my name, show me a real nigga wit a brain
Too it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus: 1x]

[Verse 3]
You know I gotta get props, I can't stop, wit out y'all
I be nothin, no wreckin, no checkin, no rhymin, no cuttin
No stages from pages, no phones, no beeper's
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real like respectin in rule
Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day, around the wha, around the muthafuckin way

Q-Tip,"Take you (higher)
Hit you (higher)
Make you (higher)
Hit you (higher)
Take you (higher)

I don't know what to make of this
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous
I guess I really gotta do it
Put my game down
Hold the game you fucking blew it
Put my name down
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong
Figured out a lot, you won't be that way long
Plus, you niggas is bush leaguers
And I bet y'all ain't get no bush either
My hood dogs sing songs of rejection and pain
If we get sunshine, it's followed up by rain
Like to lay your jig down and get a blessing of brains
My man Skeet so he stressing your chain
We see the 'morrow through the shades of it might not come
Got to get it all now 'cause we might be done
Matrix, nigga (nigga) you looking at the one
Fortified with a bonafide blastin' of a gun
We in the space for positionin'
Money and illiciting
Living out our lives while certain cats just lookin' in
We bewildered off the sacks and the green
Whether the bay, L.A., or Chicago or Queens
You better raise your game
They comin' at you high
You better raise your game
Don't ask no questions why, nigga
Then speak figuratively, I mean this shit
And speak literally, you in some shit

I dominate flows
I dominate shows
And, in the night time our dominance grows
And, you could see from the posture I'm holding
Yo, I'm re-ing up while the rest is folding
A hip hop cat who's flown world wide and
Experience, adventures like Poseidon
Bunk heads with r and b chicks
Give 'em one hit joints and they lookin' for the remix
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze
I'm so irregular
Ear on the cellular
Let's celebrate 'cause your man is a hell of a
Fillin' the blank with a good thing to fill in
We hold it still 'cause we walkin' with still (chance)
Blindsided up in your own reality
While we in the heat of the moment, fuck morality
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma (ma)
I'm lookin' straight don't see your eyes get my point ma (ma)
However you do it, I'm doing you back
Yo, don't misconstrue it, 'cause I'm screwing it back
Yo, rappers better count my presence as they down time
I gotta move around, don't have no fuck around time
So, you better just get on back

Q-Tip,"Brand new truck, butter soft seat
Four point something with a low ride something
Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
Who looking better and damn you looking good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in a choice ride
Listen to the CD's I play inside
Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie
And when the evening is over love
Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find its stashed then you don't freak
You want to nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga want to get near
Oh I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride round with you 'cause you my special friend, uh

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

The second cut, her ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we painting on
Abstract the word we creating on
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tip's past the legal one
Outkast's banging loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected brand new inspected
Emissions got tested details perfected
Got the armor all touch empty out the dutch
No tobacco spilling on my rug clutch
Kick off your shoes show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues we all forgetting more
Boy that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy maybe you blink
A little harder than your average hugagraph
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you back tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheeling drinking no Earl
Vacationing, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

Oh, me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on",Let's Ride
Q-Tip,"Looky here, looky here, looky here! 
You out the frame with it, you off the chain with it
You out the frame with it, woman, woman

You got your girlfriend around ya. 
No wonder she surround you. Look at you.
Your brown eyes pierce just like a knight, 
Make a fella think real hard about the rest of his life.
The whole shit is strange. I'm really thinkin' brains
But on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain.
Flimsy little men, they can't command you
And they don't have the heart to demand you,
But neither do I. I guess I'll let you walk
On and watch 'cause your walk is strong.
Sippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club, 
It doesn't necessarily equate to love.
It's not really in the air, I want to take it elsewhere
Somethin' wild that you can't compare.
Bangin' on my wood drum now
Hope your hearin' all the sound. Now, nigga, come now.
Sittin' at home, a hat in my hand 
While you crawlin' on the earth with your natural tan.
Your than is jigg-a-lin' and causin' a stir. 
Let's do it real rough until life is a blur.

[Chorus]
I suit you the way that'chu want.
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want.
It caught me the way that'chu want. (""Uh, uh, uh."")
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want. (""Check it out, now."")
I suit you the way that'chu want. (""Check it out. Check it. Uh."")
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want. (""Check it."")
It got me the way that'chu want.
Hey, hey, hey, the way that'chu want.

I can kinda understand, you know. 
I mean bein' at the top, I mean to start a show.
The brushes with fame, continuous game you get,
Hustles with plans, stakin' they clans and shit.
But you shine and you pay it no mind, always
Stayin' on the grind with the things you do.
You got the illest little switch and you 
Ain't takin' no shit cause nobody want to fuck with you
Admiration to the utmost. 
All my dogs raise your cups 'til the girl toast.
I don't want to bring shame to you really,
I want to put flames to you sincerely.
Make your box-spring jump like a low rida.
Best place that I could be is inside ya.
The love that we have could be real 
But you gotta go by what your heart feels.
Heart feels [Repeat: x4]
Come on.

Q-Tip,"[Q-Tip]
For real though who really got sent 
Flown on the edge got the ledge hangin' out of the window
Bird chest niggas with you (wondrous fearaf?)
Fuck around you'll be (hemp's meat) inside of a meal sack
Puny little bucks better hit the Jake
But that doesn't mean nothing to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team I'm amped up
And you asses can't dib me bead 
My shine what the fuck is on your mind?
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers ain't motivated they can't do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we march at the dance
Inside of your mind or inside of my pants?
Musical intention that we have is vast
You sick? Drink a NyQuil well I'm dead on your ass
Oh well then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some sugars but you yap on your selling friends 
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamal I'm in completely zone
It's rap time for you that means nap time
Preaching from my joint what the fuck I'ma clap mine
Singing songs of 6 pence it's intense 
Surprise your ass at the end like the sixth sense
Heavy hitters knocking shit out the park
You couldn't even really play tell me why did you start
Spitting sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid I'm not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your fucking playground
Put on your headphones tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town

[Q-Tip]
Coming with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme 'cause I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act raps just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have they own fun
Now they've all grown up to be assholes
I'm giving you the rope will you tie up the lassos
You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daiquiris in the south west breeze
Writing so exciting the pen it keeps
Dripping out gems that's converted to hems and then
People be humming it from now to they next to kin
My family is starving You know they want me to win
Me forfeit nigga please get off it
Send a check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it

I puff L's with ladies and gentlemen
I break spells with faith in a burst of wind
Others talk but.what they talk about?
Who could walk but live what they walkabout
A calm head in the middle of wartime
People go down just so they could get more shine
Girls wave your flag and surrender your faculty
Niggas got geez but its not really mack to me
Keep it soft like we killers and often gat
You walking on me guaranteed you be crawling back
Abstract see it like this is the king in you
Allies living one more if I'm fucking too
Dogs don't eat it up increase they feeding time
I'll be damned if a mutt starts eating mine
Let's stay clubbed out the moon makes it whistle
Pants gripped your ass now I hope they don't fall apart
Look around you tell me who else is shining girl
Fat rapping cats on my dick they just whining girl
That's just the magnetism that a Queens fella has
Range rover gism and he fronting with his Lexus ass
But watch I'ma drop to a bronco
See me in your Bentley nigga just honk yo!
And just know that your man to can get that
And just though that I don't really wet that
And just know that this nigga here flips tracks
Ooh what, whose ya, pain and slip that
The illest regiment is what I represent
Get us mad you gonna see the way gorillas went
Mactime I need a diamond at least a friend
I fear Allah he has no start and he has no end
We raise the roof up and tear the fuck up off
Bucking hard like the coast guard, who's soft?

Q-Tip,"We on a brand new page (Uh)
Millennium days
Desperation on the streets gotta find a new way
Keep the mics and choke holds
The saga unfolds
Machavellian approaches executed by the coach
I'm in these streets like a ghost
The air-jettin' artist
To the love, I hit 'em right plus I hit the hardest, man
I got a whole new approach for the rhymin'
You cherry cats slide, I'm holdin' out for the Heisman
You play the rappin' roll
I take the rap and sold
And intertwine it wit' mine and turn a half to whole
I'm just a genie in a jack bottle
Them fake ballin' ass cats is just a wack model
This joint knocks wit' the force of a gat throttle
I live by 'you put it out, we get it back' motto
Hey, but who around but just your average reproduction, love
Rap is gettin' lose so all the ice is screamin' thug
What the hell is wrong
I'm askin' in this song
One time I smoked hash out of the hippies' bong
One of us is goin' laid 'cause I ain't gettin' played
I leave you right inside that shitty-ass bed you made
And walk along chuggin' baller's brains, rockin' rings
And things and just waitin' for white rains
I got the drive, dog
I hope the dogs' ready
My mentality on dime chicks is stay sweaty

You wanna shoot dice or wanna shoot rounds
Wanna sell rhymes or wanna sell pounds
The decision is yours. I'd rather see tours
Get chicks wit' ghetto shit fallin' out they drawers
My team stay posted. they stay roasted
Niggas who all in it had a hard knock livin'
Administra, rhyme minista, illa treasura
You didn't know that your man was a legend, huh
Embonishment for the both of you
I hit the road and I take my whole fuckin' crew
Cause I'm a queens cat (True) to the g's cat (True)
Gettin' money for more than one needs cat (Aight, c'mon)
Condition never peers and (Take it home, kid) mind stands out

Your mental ammunition is faulty wit' a drain
I puts it down, lord, fuck a mic cord
Brother's out of his game so we can see tours

Q-Tip,"She only likes it when it's hot. She doesn't like the cold.

She only likes it when it's hot. 
Doesn't like it when it's cold

I believe love, love

Uh of the things we believe
There's a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves
And we got a hold firm when fate's full like a sieve
Why doubt your plans cause when its all worth believing
We can make it work do believe that
We've mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact
By tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves into the world into the rap game
Emcees are miserable that means their music's leaving mikes maimed
Man look we holding down for the truth
If we alone in the loop we gone hold for the proof
Man put it in believing
Believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing its the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other put the question to the system
They promising returns then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it
Belief can confirm make it is what it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't

I believe that's love (let's go c'mon)
I believe that's love
That's love

In the land of make belief time to make unbelief believable
Take a belief to the realm of the real
Believe in this shit that's force fed through the medium
Believe it is real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be weary of them theories carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends don't believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbeliefs right in front of you
Troops on the other side what you gone do

Before the scheme it seems real it reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours
You ain't commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem

Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
Thou while its wittiest
On the low we the grittiest

Who nursery rhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures

Yo you puss in boots
Energy's electric who's looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around
Comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones, we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit, we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man

Q-Tip,"Sent you a message, sent you an email
Hasty decisions we made still prevail
Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail
Walking through the corridors of my mind
The hideaways and nooks, and things with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah that's for sure
Still a bankroll and yeah still couture
But man this thing we had was much more
Come back home, don't be out in the world
It's a rat race and no place for a girl
Amongst the scavengers,I found a pretty pearl
It's for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we calling guts
And we, and we and we ahhh

We gotta gettin up
We gotta gettin up
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin up
Said we gettin up

Come over here baby, don't look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedy's
You and I advance, certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end
And you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man
No other could contend
Or we could be like Doves exposed 2 history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty let's do this all nite
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up, I promise that I'll bite

We gotta gettin up

Today is nice come on we gettin up

Tonite is right come on we gettin up

I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come thru
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives so colorful
A wonderful spectrum, not 1 tone dull
Full of excitement and not 1 lull
See we had an understanding, oh yes we did
I'm bringing it back, I'm puttin in my bid
Have a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs
We like Ruby Dee and Ossie, Martin and Coretta
Doin it to death, no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our sprits still together
Come on now, here's a placement for your hand
You rockin with the #1 MC man
The #1 controller of right with the plan

Q-Tip,"Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
And I think about my chance for me to intervene
And it's up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it, cause here I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it?
So to stick it in, to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood, is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends, they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe on me, could not survive on me
Cause this is my man's on me, this is my fams
And here's somethin' new, it's front row for you
So don't misconstrue, it's Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard, don't stop your repertoire
As long as you could see, it's you who's stayin' we
Cause life is filled with (?) pills and little pearls and shit
I'm fuckin' up, I mean, I'm trippin' up
But still, there is a void, and people get annoyed
Let's focus is on the feel, before we get a deal
Come on

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same

With the vibe we came, to put back on the street
Let's take care of ours, and ensure we eat
And Oprah an 'em, they criticize the boys
Without in between, they lose all their boys
They can't keep us down, we're dominate and brown
And those other shades, they join our parade
But wait there's rain ahead, like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris, is shit she gotta see it
I'm no different to you, I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page, I don't come of age
I'm not a deity, I'm far from perfect, see
I roll the tumble weed, it's just a humble scene
That I present to you, is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony, and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are, the door, I hope's ajar
And soon we're walkin' in, a blip, it's just to say, ""Come on""

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But you're not alone, I see we're just the same",Johnny Is Dead

Get down, (Man and woman get down)
Good God, make it easier now

Man and woman be patrollin the earth
Puttin shit in the game
Citizens, of the world, we runnin out
Precious time is a grain of sand
Ignored by the hand
(Work hard man everyday)
Work hard man everyday (for who?)
For another man's plan
Man orders woman when he come home
Getcha ass in the air!
(My woman wants it just as much as I do)
Woman wants it just as much as he does
But makes as if she don't care
Man and woman in the same where I'm from
We havin things on the mind
Minimum wage and the internet page (she cry)
Protect themselves from crime
The bluest collar on the brownest of skin
White, yellow, red too
They don't care, who it is
They watchin you
Conspiracies, so you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu
Man and woman, yo you might as well dance
Gettin down, Zulu, come on

Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand
Men and women, what's goin on, inside of our minds?

Oh no, sing it one more time, come on

Gettin down is somethin to do between woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand

Check it out
Red man was the first on the continent
This you gotta understand
Woman not behind, she's right beside him there
And they both toil land
White man fightin for independance from, an old empire
Woman makes a flag for a new nation and
Lets the flag waves high
Black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
Bought the breastfeeding new
Black man, mentally, he broke it too
But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do
Man/woman always doin the dance
One wops, one pops
We'd be lucky if we both find a groove
That we both can lock
Can man be stronger if a woman was there?
I would have to say yes
Can woman make it without men being there?
She would have to be blessed
Woman and man are the spiritual forces
Brought together to live

Q-Tip,"Here we come yo, here we come

I'm just a brotherman, descendant of the motherland
I fuck with blackberries and dimes and butter tens
Good on my right and trouble on my other hand
Life is a tight rope I'm dyin' the balance in
And by the end hopefully I be the balance-man
A simple dude who can exude the talents and
I am the captain of the hot blooded caravan
Spread in a different look to charred and battered lands
It's outta function I see girls that can top it off
I hold mines while these cowboys pop it off
You just a movie-dude claimin' that you pop-soft
This shit's like cold grits without the hot sauce
This government seems to me like it's off course

Come on come on
Let's move and get down

Your dubious style may rock for right now
But in the long run, you really lost one
Jamaica, Queens-man land of the tossed gun
It's never easy police nah sees we
Go through the checkpoints birds flip to po nine
I got a bad bird nicknamed her sunshine
I treats her so kind sweetening her at nighttime
Into the right tunes we hit the right rhymes
I dig her fashion smash into my memory
And in the club shorty stays real into me
A humble dude and never will pretend to be
The type of artist that's desired for the industry
Came in this fucka me and I'm a leave me
And in the end B you would believe me that I'm a leave me
So what's a industry if the listeners will always stand beside me?

Gather around, the Renissance man has finally appeared
And I'm astonishing rap characters are cause of the tears
Quasimodo and the quotables excrete from my mouth
And no doubt, we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal
And when the opposition's Abstract, bless your soul
They are the reason MCs but none on the level
Other you're the vocalist, precious like metal
Makin all my rounds through the towns like physician
I be curing inpure emcees, plagued with disease
So take a spoonful of Poet Penicillin and
Sit back and listen to your man as I fill it in the Renaissance

Rap, Renaissance
This is the Renaissance
This is the Renaissance

So here we go, now
It is the Midnight Maurader on the scene
Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles, way I displayed
When I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill, so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there, on Farmers Boulevard, I made my mark
Two dudes, niggas would dip from us, me, and NARCS
And then my, legend would grow on the A-train line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me, Big, Pete, Tanya, and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher, I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
Get it in ya head, we gon' rock the dead
Night of the living MCs', the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit, Renaissance won't quit
We gon' baptize y'all for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr. Strange
Making cultures move, if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin, it won't bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we don't see it as one
We don't quit, bullshit, and we never lost, son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearing's impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it, it's like dynamite
And it's the Renaissance, rap

Uh, uh, it's the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uh, cause it's the Renaissance
It's the Renaissance, rap
It is the Renaissance rap

Now lookin at ya clock, you know that it's time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the T-O-P
That be G-O-D, and I be T-I-P
The promoter of the flyness, witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came, but I'm the royal highness
Don't'cha ever forget, who put the pep in ya step
We made it cool to wear medallions and say hotep
And this beat is suh'thin that you can't recover up from
You better a-joinin the force because we can't be done
Listen, we on this mission and it's a go
So welcome to the Renaissance in stereo

Q-Tip,"Oh, yeah, well the bell has rung because the time is here
Oh, yeah, we gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear
Oh, yeah, not much is for sure, but this here is true
Oh, yeah, I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you

Major attraction, trouble distraction
Scramble up my name and it still come action
Music's our number, dial to sue slumber
Open up your ears to the low tint of thunder
Creative queens native, mixes are the native
Want some fresh shit? then we're correlative
Busta is ferocious, unflawed and precocious
Airin fools out cause my willy bodacious
Peoples don't blame me, shorties can't game me
Country cherokee but the city here made me
Rock like coral, distinctive 'bout my orals
Got lil' grime and got lotta laurels
The rhythm stay bangin, my one, two thangin
Is exemplified by the comp left hangin
Percussion's our weapons, drums are smith & wesson's
Lyrics poppin off leaving deep impressions

Oh, yeah, well the bell has rung because the time is here

Oh, yeah, I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you

I feel what the beat does, people fuck wit me cause
When the song end, I become what the beat was
Same thing as other, no need for cookie cutter
The bar gets raised, not your average old gutter
For that I hit a chin up, b, ya time been up
Would've came sooner but I overslept my get, up
Now let's get in the middle, girl I'll solve your riddle
Cause we can be strong and protect against the brittle
If groupies need to see me, go and get the cd
I aerosol you all top to bottom like graffiti
Biz {?} lot and, dudes say I'm pardon
When you hear the music, thus begins the mardi gras and
Rhymes ain't the issue, that's how I'm gon' get you
Don't need a billboard hit for me to +hit+ you
The clairvoyant micist, who always come the tightest
Queens everywhere demostratin who the flyest

Oh, yeah, well the bell has rung because the time is here
Mmm, mmm, we gotta change it around and put our thang in gear
Oh, yeah, not much is for sure, but this thang is true

Q-Tip,"Uh, ah, uh

My brother Shaka would have wanted me to do it like this
So raise your glasses for the lost ones in your life

Dilla Dawg and Master Wel would have wanted me, as well
To propel with the spirit of the mic

Even if you had one person with you and it's hard
They make it easy, celebrate them, let them just who they are

Because of these experiences I have some control
On the microphone, I'm bold elevating to the stars

Here's a demonstration, with the excellence
Reverse the pandemic that's filled with pestilence
Who has his finger on the pulse of the b-boy?
Serving fiends with the stream of a d-boy
Who's well connected, you must respect it
I'm driven with the spirits mentioned in this record
Hopefully this serves as motivation
The never sayin ?doc? kind of sensation
Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it
Mama I know, let me put lil' thamp on it
Blade runnin through the day with agility
Stay gunnin, make way for possibilities
It's the capital Q, rap it'll do
What I want it to, it's like tamin a shrew, uh
Livin life, the Shakespearean proportions
Knowin better, I've experienced distortions
And through the in and outs, of life's revolvin doors
I'mma see that, I'm still gettin more
Yeah I'm comin in, I'm gon' see my friends
To the top floor, it seems it never ends
Heaven never ends, yeah it never ends
It be goin on, it's phenomenon
Like a new born, or a Stevie song
It be going on, do ya feel it?
(Do ya feel it? Do ya feel it?)

Don't lose sight y'all without giving a fight

I'm channeling Weldon Irvine Mr. Clean
He would've wanted me to say what I mean, and mean give it right

You've inspired so many and forever will you last

And to my father, yo your spirit is drapin me
Never escapin me, I'm happy that I had you in my past

Q-Tip,"For your epitaph, niggas laugh, chicks steady gas your ass
Siphoning out your cash, seein' the door, the flash
While I stay enclosed, walkin' out in my clothes
She said, ""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You motherfuckin' right, wantin' this shit every night
Finish up, I hold her tight, wearin' feelings on my sleeve
Even when I had to leave, cooler than the evening breeze
Do you believe?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The Division One leader, in the rebound with numerous shorties, off the post
Goin' coast to coast, she on the hardwood, sub, I'm out the game
She sayin', ""Nah, he good"", I mean
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

For no amount of dough, franchise this man
Give him all the things you can
Think long-term plans, he be bringin' in the fans
Front-page magazine, listen to this lady scream:
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause she know what's better for her
Toppin' in the peckin' order
Fluid like the runnin' water, nicest nigga? Kinda, sorta
When he screamin' just the slaughter, no matter the quarter
I get it
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The club-house king, battin' practice, slug and swing
Game time's anything, when I'm in, you're 'bout a minute
Holdin' the bat, it's good as fact
She's out the park, and comin' back
She sayin'
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Everywhere you sit you get a good view of the ballplayer and all
And the famous hall inevitably will make a call
Hangin' memorabilia from your walls
This is why you can't trade me
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

You can put your money on a sure thing
Certain profits will they bring
Ceremonies are the ringer, in the White House thing
Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring
Do you wanna trade?
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

Cause in the end as a teammate
You're lookin' for a back shoot, and go-to ball
Leaves it all on the floor, always lookin' to score
Pep-talks in the locker-room
This is why you sing this tune
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

And injuries can't make me sit, I ball till you get out
Hook off, no di-doubt, and all like get out
I train for the pressure and come out fresher
Equipped for the game, you know my name
It makes me better
A cheer, for the whole team, let's go, for the whole thing
The ballad that you're holding, MVP voting
And I, represent the sentiment, you're emoting
As you say
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

The physical ability, with mental capability
Legitimately places me inside of your vicinity
And I ain't really seein' me vacatin' this community
I'm stayin' here
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""

I'm glad that you feel this way
Here's where I like to play
I need to hear it everyday, they cheer for me, say, ""Ole""
Wait a minute, ""Andele""?
I dunno, well, anyway
""I wouldn't trade it for nothing""",Won't Trade

Looking, for how I see her
When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat, my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so why be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get it in
That's when the snooping and shit, it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a hello or I miss you
Or the renaissance, how does it do?
Suspicious ones, go few
Can stress out your brain
It weighs on your man
And helps your peep game, I thought it was me
But then I could see

It was you

But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though, I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doing love
Get it? These things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
It's never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff, but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seeking
Well it seem I'm getting close
That I'm reaching
And I was thinking, I had no reason
Calling you a culprit, it was treason
And the twinkle, in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if you're committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you

It's you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you

I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I want a (gangsta bitch) I need a (gangsta bitch)
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse One]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)

I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Two]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want to ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)

QED,"Come on!

When you make love do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of? Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice or just touch 'n' see, ooh yeah?

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need
It's what I need

When I'm with you are you somewhere else?
Am I gettin' through or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love if you throw it about, ooh c'mon

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it

Drop the tops, and ladies y'all pull out the bathing suits
'Cause it's gonna be a scorcha

Yeah baby, come on it's time to have some fun
It's summer time so let's unwind and go out in the sun
I like when all the young ladies be off on the beach
Tryin' to creep 4-deep in them convertible Jeep

Lookin' oh so sexy, wearin' them daisy dunes
They lookin' so cute in them 2-piece bathing suits

'Cause them girls be so fine down south in the summer time

Halter tops and daisy dunes, sexy 2-piece bathing suits
Hair and nails is up to par, lookin' like a superstar
Lot of clouds up in the sky and all them ladies lookin' fine
Big, tall, short, and fine
Oh yeah, it must be summer time

Come on and break out your daisy dunes
Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun
Stomp your feet and clap your hands, and wild out to the Summer Jam

It's summer time, time to move baby, it's time to dip baby
But we can't, traffic's jammed on the strip by them playas
With them vogues on the Cadillacs
Bending curves in suburbs with the boom in the back

Matter fact, all them ladies be crowdin' around
Them playas with the Benz's when they let the top down
Cruisin' slow and low, one time for the 64
Baby pumpin' up the sound and bouncin' up and down
Everybody chillin' not a worry on they mind
Pumpin' the Summer Jam because it's summer time
(Time time)

Heavy Chevys Cadillac with them boom in the back
UCD in the deck, boy be gettin' much respect
Cruisin' up and down the block, go ahead and drop the top
Wild on out and unwind 'cause it's summer time

Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun

With all your little toys
Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to be afraid

Chillin, like a big ol pimp
Right about now, at 3:01 in the morning
Everything else on is probably pretty faulty and repetitive

When you get down to that, you know, far left hand side
Keep it tuned to mack be dog, 'cause you know

Zakir, gab, lyrics born natural as the elements
I jump down and customize
My lyrics to synchronize
And educate the young, dumb, deaf, and blind
And drop a seed in they minds, so they can open their eyes
Realize and recognize we livin in the last times

I pull a spark of shining light out of the glorious fate
Create the lyric arsenals that verbal warriors make
Escape hell temporarily
Merrily vibes carry me to heavenly states
Inevitably rockin steadily

Yea, I represent the underground mc
Even though I move around I'm still down with mc's
Now pound for pound I go the round
I is down, as you see (? ? ? )
I'm from the group, jayou, the j 5 mc's, yea

Oh god, it's so re-al, and then ya, it's ser-I-al
Flowin, like soy milk, over sweetened cer-e-al
Y'all melt, like toys built from cheap material
Reevaluate yourself, it ain't about the here and now

I hold it def for 6
Blazed my way up out an orphanage
Assertive it, poetic scripts blast murderous
The earth shaker, I crack a nigga out his windbreaker
The verbalier, rhythmatic fly commentator

Yo, now if you stumble on a phonograph
To listen to the flavas that you got to have
With lyrics that be perfectly handcraft
All the way from the bay to l.a.
We're tryin to give you all different points of view
To show you our poetic words that we use
From the mc's that you're bound to choose
All the way from the bay to l.a.

So passengers fasten up these average cats'll never catch up

Yeah I hot dog the ball behind the yes yes y'all
Fuck hanging on the shore trying to ball ? ? ? ?

No, I don't jitterbug with lyrically idiotic litterbugs
They shit and bug the shit out of me eat em up for dinner so

We imburse to disperse, wish your last was your first bit
Consume the whole room and you wonder where the earth went

So I reduce the risk
Spit words like a journalist
And burnin it in unofficial mic tournaments

I'll play off night watchin trife 'cause we might utilize
The mic as a rightful for the eyes on the prize (? ? ? )
So try to conduct yourself in a manner that's wise

Looking, over a city, that's gritty, and rather pretty
A pity, it's hard to find, but inequity, cover
Every itty bitty square diamond of jiggy
They givin ??, up to woodsy
Manipulatin they minds in the alleyways
These dizzy and shitty rats, the sizes of kitty-kats
They cross paths when traffic subsides; somewhere
Some brothers is overstandin on a hot black rooftop
Freestylin for they GOT damn lives, the spirit, it gets live
And answers the question why God blessed the Earth
But, buildings block out the sky, and the children
Are oversexualized, media-wise, brutalized by parents
At the tender age of five, in front of they siblings wide-eyed
Nah not surprised, just the real scene regularly
Up in between the lies, try to put it together GET
They pieces of the pie, hope they clever and tough
Make it better before they die, plant the next seeds
Somewhere in the South Bronx, or Patterson ??
The baddest with sharp chomp, to splatter when mouths-off
Retali' and swear he could damage em Dunn
But that will shatter his Mom's faith
In the art that she burns, herbs and candles of perm'
It's hard to call it see cause times change and the world turn
Some end up slangin dope, some end up strung out
On coke and sherm, some party every night for the rest of they life
And some learn, go corporate all professional rhetoric
With sensational glory, let me tell you all one day
That it is it ain't boring, and so hard to ignore it
Cause any day in this fork, that they callin New York
Based on nothin but currents, you can find yourself a failure
Or a success story
On the subway, at three in the mornin, huh
Or on the corner, or up on a rooftop yawnin
Meditatin upon it, lookin over a city that's gritty
And rather pretty, a pity

You know there comes a time in everybody's life when
we just need a little bit of guidance
You know we get a little lost in the fog
and it sort of impedes our vision
But there's a way that we can figure it all out
and make it happen, make it work

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to mute all the roof hogs
Let's build, useful tools, find some resolution in our lives
Three's to get your groove on, but it ain't like there's no
particular order, this ain't a true/false, answer only part of it
Everything's got an art to it
So we bottle it, market it, it don't hold water
well then we sharpen it, carve a little niche where we can all exist
as ourselves, not our sales
Despite our ails (OOH DO TELL!)
Cause I can't part with the alcohol, no doubt bruh
And on that note, I'm like my Southpaw Grandpah
He used to get his lamp on, he used to giggle at Tampons
And I'm probably not supposed to talk about that part
who cares though that's not important
I really broke all the sample laws with this damn song
so now I'm an outlaw
But it's time, we started talkin havin dialogue and bein honest
What's the other options - walk around, bottled up all hot and bothered
Makin assumptions and nothin gets accomplished
Can we set it off properly please?

The purpose of producin beautiful soul music is two-fold
One is fun - two goes to glue all the loopholes
Music is fuel, to get us where we goin in our lives
Three is still to groove on, but it ain't like there's a
paricular void, that's true though, that's my whole argument
That's where I'm at, there's where I've always been
Cause we've made accomplishments, we just need to proceed
with the utmost confidence - so, whether that encompasses you
signing up with your community nautilus
Buy a couple joggin suits, hop up on that pommel horse
and burn some ounces off your gluts, your upper abdominals
Openin offices, in major metropolises
Get some flossy cards, your logo embossed on em
Not the cost effective models
where you gotta cross the old pager number off the bottom
and draw, all kinds of lines all across it
and write your mom's spot, on top, and along the side of em
like, ""Aww man, my pencil's not sharp -- know what?
Let me, let me just get your card, tight
Also, is it possible, can you run me by a Jack in the Box?""
Like I should, open office, minimize losses
Reinvest profits, we refine the process
by readin all the options, keepin all we promised
So we not caught up, all the fellas with the pants down
ladies caught topless, showin they casabas
Ignore that garbage, that was just some old nonsense
Strictly off the top shit, measurin the progress
The heart has the yardstick, anything else? Uhh yes..

Quannum,"Check it
It began at sea
Three cross currents concurrently
Started turning creatin' the mother of all tempest to be
Excess precipitation and ionization
The cloud cover hovered ground 2000 feet
Listening swiftly to meet the ocean's wave peak
Along the jet stream was a fog
Sparkin', rollin', and pourin' needles of rain
Thunderin' like god's bowlin' lane

Crashin' and collidin', the master of craftsmen 
Passionately expressing his anger with his angst 
Then flashes rains
Insanity in fastening are rationally lashing out
Blossoming from his majestic means
Patterns and waves gravity couldn't tame
Battling seas with seas the skies were stale
The light light rain of lightening veins
Brought in gray clouds with bright silk, then fade

Devistating
The dark, thick, all bliss, cumulus
Looked more like swabs of cotton in a chalk cold ditch
Stretched across all four tips of the horizon
Yet its movement was swift
But then there seemed to be a shift
A small pause with and oddness and a stillness that felt
Ominous

Now if the storm was the servant under the earth's surface
The congregation was stirrin'
Nourishin', swellin', like a serpent turning
Like a burning furnace yearning
It was churning perturbed and quite determined to be heard
So the ocean floor bursts the earthquake emerged
And it formed a network of corridors
Which made the earth porous, the force urge forth, the surf warm
And the storm that served above it assumed the same course
Now as the rain poured waters the basin tore its corners
And they both aimed toward the northern california shore
And as the wind whispered warning, the ground hinted authority
The long shore men leaned forward, also were corneas
Quadruple in proportion he was lord by his formal introduction
To the forth coming force

That afternoon the appetite of the catastrophe beast cooled
Began by snacking on the panoramic view, the population of people
Every single house so feeble in the mouth of the storm
The needle of the richter scale teetered and trembled
So beautifully warned
Picturesque hale shot through the windowsill 
The glass splinters sailed through the innards of little children
Waitin' for dinner, they entered then exited
The earth split like dry flesh and then engulfed two whole blocks
The roofs flew off like screw off tops
The school for the arts, the schoolin' docks
Plus few supermarkets and all its human contents
Of ruddy is screwed on top like you throw blocks
Now if you're alive to announce true accounts all over your mouth
Of rumble mills spouted keep your mouths and dollars damaged
The doom, the trials, the tribulations
You can do without the balance between life and total devastation

Everything around you shakin' and you quakin'
And you feel the rocking of the foundation 
This madness slanted vibrations
And down you go, your mind's been slow around you so
Dishes flying out of their kitchen cabinet door
A few crashin' when they smash in the windows
That's when you recognize 
The warning isn't just the terror in your eyes
Or fear between your ears
It's thunderin', the rumblin', is it all over you're now wonderin'
That's when the telephone pole rips through the roof
And adds a wide stake through your living room 
Nature's heavy burden is now passed on to you
Your world eaves and pulls, you watch the house next door
Swallowed by a sinkhole, it's out of control, wow

Riveting whirlwinds gripping the world
Women and children wait a minute we're all in jeopardy

The wind brought the rain
The rain cleared the lane for the quake
And still made room for more rockin'
The quake shook the state, the state took the bait
Then sank, but still made room for more rockin', rockin'

It's like the bible says, the final days, the tidal waves
The earthquakes, the storm that breaks, simultaneously
Smack the landmass, orderin' california
The pourin' rain , the smoke and flames
The earth engaged in open man, from growin' pains
The broken mains regurgitating all in vain, pain 
Your orphan daughter screams in vain
The block you came rectangular lace, from people grievin'
Neighborhoods that hydroplane, heavy breathin' can repeat
From passenger and everybody trying to escape on half a tank
Hearts palpitate, valves breakin', gas tanks, fault lines, open wine
We fall flyin', nose line
Behind us a car is blindsided by a semi
Fallin', cascadin', golden gate totaled, spiralin', spiralin'
Until the hemorrhages fall",Storm Warning

I heard the future from afar.
We heard the past, from a distant star.
I saw the patterns in the sky.
We saw our only chance passing by.
I saw the people change to cope.
We saw a distant space of love and hope.

Sucker MC don't you love me, want to have me, want to que me, one two three. It's just a modest proposal from a boy anti-social, scraping the skin of our culture, civilized vulture. Do me in, don't make me sin, I'm doing so good I can't go through it again.

I bomb the mic like a fascist, Mussolini comin' through with no remorse, from the dark you won't see me. Rise up from the sea like a godzilla straight up through your mind with my armour plated drilla. I don't give a fuck what you think about this shit, ain't in it for the money never out to make a hit. If you can't take it like I said get a grip 'cause I'm here to fucking stay like the warts on your dick. 

Stick 'em up.

So won't you make a man out of me, I've gotta be, connected computerized son of a bitch, makes me itch, sucker for life. I can't decide darkness or light or just a heavenly fright. Stick it, I'm tired I'm bored, I'm trying so hard and I can't be adored. So the sound brakes through from one tone, gives me no choice I can't be alone. 

Stick 'em up.

Like Darth Vader I surprise you with my skills. I knock your 'ol ass out like a bag of sleeping pills. I got to rip things up like my name was Jack the Ripper. There's a party at your house cause your mama is a stripper. Slice through the scene like a knife through peanut butter. Get your ears cleaned out motherfucker I didn't stutter. S. W. A. R. E. Z!

We gotta go for attack before he gets far, blow up the death star and kill the copycat. Now to the next episode when we are back on the road and we are racing time and we are cracking the code.

It's not that a big of a deal, just another mouth to feed and another bread to steal I feel I'm loosing my grip about to slip about to fall of the wagon and have another sip. Periodic fake divines, these times as we see ?em are packed with cons that can't wait to see him. the cave the cathedral, the peasant the pope, the hope of the people is a prayer for dope.

All night long we have to keep it up all night long. And right to the next damn day, we have to do the shit they say. All night long we have to keep it up all night long. And right to the next damn day, we have to do the shit they say. 


And we choke in the vomit of our belief and we greave as we go on in disbelief. In this world in this life that we are living where it is nobler to take than to be giving. Stop. Get behind excess stress and no caress this form of society is making a mess. Moreover, it's over and it's a damn crime. How many we are killing in the meantime. 

Chorus


So I'm pushed to my feet so I can beat the air that was giving me heat way back over there. It's only fair to give guy a slack the big aphrodisiac, the new jack the ever confusing cool cat. Now see me fly on the Nashville skyline walking the fine line, reciting a new line, holding my balls while taking the calls, sorry we're closed. I'm on the bottom of the Niagara Falls. But I still believe and with so little to give I don't want to deceive only Malone to live. We take it back that the hope is the dope. The dope's the hope in the shape of a rope.

I creep up but they don't want me back in you know my love is so big I think my head is cracking, smacking my face and always giving me the baseline, dead in a days time, give back what's mine.

Gonna reach you in numbers.

Used to have a lot of tight friends but now the bonds are losing. 
You know that shit ain't right man.
I heard rumors confusing'.

Too may dreamers are fading, shine on, shine on, shine

Live, there's a life to live
Give, there's a gift to give
Yes, there's a reason to make it
Shine on and make it true,
Work, make it work for you
Yes, there's a reason to make it shine

Find a secret and learn it, find a key there and turn it
Do whatever you do through the night
A skill in your fingers like a memory lingers
You gotta do it till it comes out right
You never know till you take a chance
If you're out on that wire you might as well dance",Make It Shine
Quarterflash,"Saw my father living in a picture
Squinting in the Michigan sun

And shoot me on the run

Take another picture
Please, please freeze my features
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another

Underneath father's ties

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Quartet Hors Saison,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand

It means I am begging for your hand

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Queen,"Wilson, Wilson
Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Do you mean it ?
Do you mean it ?
Why don't you mean it ?
Why do I follow you and where do you go

You've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh give me a little time to choose

Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size

A little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a baby oil
(aah aah) black on (aah aah), black on every finger nail and toe

A voice from behind me reminds me
(tra la laa tra la laa aaah)
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do (will bear a will) bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man, very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

I've got the power - now do the march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy - I'll be your bad boy - I'll do the march of the Black Queen

Ah aah ah aah
Ah aah ah aah
Walking true to style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes, and she never dots her ""I's""

She's our leader
La la la la laa la la laa
La la la la la laa

Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies

Queen,"You never heard my song before the music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well for now we both know how
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
But some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
A misty castle awaits for you
And you shall be a Queen (you shall be a Queen)
Today the cloud, it hangs over us and all is grey
But some day, one day...

When I was you and you were me and we were very young
Together took us nearly there, the rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
But some day one day...
We'll come home

Queen,"So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends

Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late - ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night

Queen,"Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low - so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues",My Melancholy Blues
Queen,"I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Here sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

(Now I tell you what happened...)

They took me to a room without a table
They said 'blow your trumpet into here'
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(Have to have some fun...)

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and
I sure do want to go home
(Yeah)",Sleeping on the Sidewalk
Queen,"I make it half past six you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs well I don't need who needs you?

Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?

I like it I like it
Well I don't need you

How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

When I met you you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs well I don't need who needs you?",Who Needs You

Queen,"Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
""Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar""

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
""This could be my last chance""

His boss said to him ""now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar""

So honey
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Used to be your pride and joy
Mmm, You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
And left me like a broken toy

Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playin' to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm wakin'
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
Mmm, I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise not to wake me till it's morning
It's all been true

What do you say about that then honey ?
Are you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball ?
I'd like that
Right on that forty second street
Way down down town we must go

Oh take me take me take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

Oh, take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball

In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender",One Year of Love
Queen,"Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure

When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
All your life
Ooh ooh ooh

And honey bees have lost their stings

And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides

And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of thirty-nine came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling went away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year

To the things I learnt so well in my youth 
I think I'm returning to 
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth 
Now, there are no games 
To only pass the time 
No more colouring books 
No Christmas bells to chime 
But thinking young and growing older is no sin 
And I can't play the game of life to win 
I can recall a time 
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend 
And, now, I think I've got 
A lot more than just my toys to lend 
Now there's more to do 
Than watch my sailboat glide 
And every day can be 
My magic carpet ride 
And I can play hide and seek with my fears 
And live my days instead of counting my years 
Then everyone debates 
The true reality 
I'd rather see the world 
The way it used to be 
A little bit of freedom's all we lack

Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child don't you know you're young
You got your whole life ahead of you?
And you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody's
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you",Sail Away Sweet Sister

I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive yeah 
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles

Queen,"Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Wooh, is this the world we created?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created",Is This the World We Created...?

It's a miracle we need, the miracle

If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle (we're having a miracle on Earth)
Mother nature does it all for us

Super powers always fighting
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling

All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone

Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die

All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet

Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow

Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)

Queen,"Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
This could be my last chance

His boss said to him now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar

So honey

I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the Earth

And treasure every moment

Oh you'll be so proud

Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world

Queen,"It's the sad eyed goodbye
Yesterday's moments I remember
It's the bleak street, week kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mists the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young
And your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall
Than we did in the school hall
With the down town chewing gum bums
Watching the night life the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong
It's easier from an arm chair
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like",Drowse

Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go, with the flow

These are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find, no change

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks and
The night grows pale
Stars of lovingmess in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And ?neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It?s for evermore that I wait

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Queen Bee,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

I see you pass my way each and every day
Could you stop just once is all I'm asking
Cause I can't seem to help myself
There's something about the way you walk
Oh I wish that we could talk 
Sit and cuddle in the park
Gazing in each other's eyes
All night

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

All my friends are angry 
They think I'm crazy
Cause I don't let you know
About this feeling that I have for you
Something tells me that you feel the same way too
It's only a matter of time, oooh

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

It's been a while now since I wanted to tell you but I found it hard mi couldn't find the courage and when I say you with another clinging on your arm I knew I had to get you so I couldn't keep my calm
I want you to keep me warm
Rubbing on each other
All night, all night

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come

Queen Latifah,"It's a fact I'll attest to, mess around and I'll arrest you
I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for ""Microphone Commando""
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me bring while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

Queen Latifah,"You asked  I came  so behold the Queen 
Let's add a little sense to the scene 
I'm living positive not out here knocked up 
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up 

This rhyme doesn't require prime time 
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine 
Back again cause I knew you wanted it 
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it 

Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled 
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle 
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track 
From KRS to be exact 

It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking 
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking 
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you 
About the evil that men do 

Situations, reality, what a concept! 
Nothing ever seems to stay in step 
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers 
Here are some things I want to cover 

A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares? 
Because she's living on welfare 
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan 
So she's in no man's land 
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal 

KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom! 

Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident 

[KRS-One] 
But there's no response from the president 

Queen Latifah: 
Someone's living the good life, tax-free 
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free 
And that's just part of the message 
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do 

Tell me, don't you think it's a shame? 
When someone can put a quarter in a video game 
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street 
You can't treat him the same 

It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind 
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds 
You to a doom, a fate worse than death 
But there's still time left 

Stop putting your conscience on cease 
And bring about some type of peace 
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind 
It will benefit all mankind 
Then there will be one thing that will never stop 
And it's the evil that men do",Evil That Men Do
Queen Latifah,"Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive 
The Queen Latifah the King of 45 
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor 
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a 
A sample sound the she added a compound 
Word this is for those who haven't heard 
A King and Queen combine minds and trample 
Those who oppose us here's an example 

It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set 
The competition is petty and ready to step 
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one 
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one 
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken 
Queen Latifah's outspoken 
Use your imagination, picture this 
Any male or female rapper trying to diss 
Here for excitement and enticement 
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment 
Teach the youth, feed the needy 
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti 
The mother of civilization will rise 
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation 
Secondary but necessary to reproduce 
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack 
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind 
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher 
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys 
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy 
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King 
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring 
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation 

Technician, musical musician 
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction 
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most 
Creativity, you get a double dose 
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test 
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet) 
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one 
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one 
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum 
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em 
I rock, never hyperventilate 
Others get tired, could use a commercial break 
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias 
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me 
Just listen, I'm unstoppable 
You want a mission? This one's impossible 
Beats rock all night with no curfew 
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue 
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it 
If the style fits, I wear it 
Many attempts were made, none was recognized 
45 King said sample soundified 
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next 
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet 
Studio mixer, I got the formula 
And said the man from self, I'm warning you 
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur 
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa 
On top, it's a usual act 
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios 
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing 
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing",A King and Queen Creation
Queen Latifah,"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is Latifah's Law

BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifah's law

Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all",Latifah's Law

Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta

My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King to the posse 
Peace, got to let you know where I come from 
The princess of the posse is a cool one 

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one 
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun 
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl 
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world 

Now take run the family 
Me say me have to do it for the R.E. posse 
You try to be down, you can't take the crown 
Maybe from someone else but not me [Repeat: x 2]",Princess of the Posse [DJ Mark the 45 King Remix]
Queen Latifah,"Let me remind you on how to unwind your body
So dance and shake and just keep in step
Understand, draw a clear picture
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom
All competitors, I simply cream them
One by one, I dust a rush them all
If you have any more, bring them
To the front so they can sho me what they got
What they got, it better be hot
Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box
And they'll be put in a spot
The style I use will surely amuse
The party people to a state of gladness
What I mean is I'm on the scene
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred
When you address me, address me as ""Your Highness""
One of hip-hop's finest
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo
It makes me no difference
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic
And draw attractions
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them
The result with a pen and a pad
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

I can't wait until the party is jam-packed
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be	
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell
Guard as well as you can or step
Off the premisis, in one minute it's
Going to explode in a style that's limitless
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust
Literature that flows like liquid
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it
So don't say nothing
Just listen up, follow instructions
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness",Queen of Royal Badness
Queen Latifah,"Well it's almost nightfall 
And there's no forecast of rainfall 
And I'm in the mood for a party 
So I'm gonna go out to a club 
And give the dancefloor body 
So I jump in the car and go to the venue 
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu 
Guys in the house they're wacthing me 
They're clocking me there's no stopping me 

(Desire) I know you want me 
(You're fine) thank you 
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am 
I don't jump into the arms of every man 
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money 
(I love you) you must be mad 
Easy lover is something that I ain't 
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint 

Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys 
I always hear, yo, baby? 
I mean like what's the big idea? 
I'm a queen, nuff respect 
Treat me like a lady 
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby 
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere 
One with class and savoir faire 
I'm looking for someone who has to be 
Perfect for the queen latifah me 

Fly girl, fly girl
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine
And I want you to be mine
Fly girl, fly girl
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands
Won't you let me be your man?

All my friends are in relationships 
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones 
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better 
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones 
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get 
I want a friend not just a lover 
Someone who is dedicated only to me 
Not to me and two or three others 
One who will not lie to me or think 
He can get my love by buying me 
I know I'll find him some day 
And when I find him 
He sure won't say 

Fly girl, fly girl
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine
And I want you to be mine
Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands
Won't you let me be your man?

Lounging, sitting in the house 
And I'm cooling, first day of the week 
So there's nothing to do 
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss 
Momma never said there'll be days like this 
So I called her and we talked for a while 
Hang up the phone feeling better 
With a smile 

It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year 
And this time I know I'm gonna hear 

Fly girl, fly girl, come here
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine
And I want you to be mine

Have no fear, your heart is in good hands
Won't you let me be your man?

Give me your love, give me your love,

I'll have no fear; I'll never run and hide just

Captivate my soul, hold me
When I'm down I need your love to console me
Some weakness tells me when the morning comes
It's hard for me to try to see you're not the one
For the love of you I just might just do most anything
It's the sensation the slightest touch can bring
Baby I adore you this is not a fling
With every breath I sing for you to

[Chorus]

When I was a very small child
My mother told me
Hold on to the things that you love
And never let them go
Love is too precious to be wasted
And that is why I want you to know

What's this madness in my mind I really new love before this time
Boy you'll take me where I've never been before.

Queen Latifah,"Oh I don't know
And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

I'm taking this time to write you this letter
Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment

I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon
(see it soon)

I want make this official man, I miss you
I feign for your touch and your kiss too

I know you love it when I call you big poppa
My thoughts are pure
I heard you left your last cause she was insecure
I'm not tryin' to compare myself but
I got health and wealth
And now you dealing w/ the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught
While I stare at the gifts you bought

The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun
Check me now
Like the time we went to six flags
Boostin', tearin' off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you my best friend

Do you remember the first time I let cha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask god to make you feel the same

Oh I don't know

(think about you all the time, yeah)
Show me a sign and wish that you would offer me a sign
Relax my mind

Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight
Don't beat around the bush

I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo dana

Oh p.s. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long

Oh I don't know

I'm runnin for the border for causin disorder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses
I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
You're lookin for the black influ'?
I do want too give it to you
What are you mad?
Give me some of what you had!
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff

(And all that stuff)

Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?

I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays
I got flavor for days
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and
From me you know you get a worth for your money, and
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff

Just Another Day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the(gunshot), but I'm here to stay

[Verse 1]
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day in the neighbor-hood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm wit whateva comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain on day to day
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, tech's, jimmy hat's, in case I need protection
So I land cruise, play I wanna be's
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me
So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they step
Cause mine's is slighty bigger
But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hopin it's you too
I got the fever for the flava of a??????
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus: 1x]

[Verse 2]
Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep it sight's
Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's own tonight
I'm doin the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T.
But it's home, so I flex, get pressure's off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next
Stomach ache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie
Get a final call for



",Just Another Day...
Queen Latifah,"[Chorus]
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And we gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

My girlies caught me on a good day
I was (something) to move a job
So we took it to a club
Nigga we would make out a little
And plus at the time I was single, a little
So I said ""Fine, we could meet up about nine""

So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin'
Some people in the joint is yellin' ""Hurt me, Hurt me""
I'm working my way over to the bar cause I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he likes me
I smile cause he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me

Well then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cause he's scared to get dissed
I don't walk baby
I don't bite neither
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'da said was ""No""
So maybe next time you better push a (something)

[Chorus]

Saturday moving in the house
Lookin' at the videos
At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes
First date (First Date) with the guy's name was Nate
Was he fly?
Yes he was
Word up, the type you have on a plate
Cause I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony

Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from my man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant

[Chorus x2]

Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
We can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gone make me love ya
And even with your car
So cease with that attitude
With that attitude you won't be getting far

And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction
(Yeah) If you cool like dat
Take a trip to Jersey cause that's where I'm at

Queen Latifah,"Uh, U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity
   U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from infinity to infinity

   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (Yeah me bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said ""Who you calling a bitch?""

					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)

               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work, give you an attitude then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?)

					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)

               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you call yourself
a ""Gangsta Bitch"" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this work getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right? Bucking with nobody
She got to wear that for life (Who you calling a bitch?)

If this love is gonna last forever

Queen Latifah,"(talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me from 
Heaven Watching my every move as usual....

(chorus)
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme

But it's bustin from the seems 
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
I'm moving all around
Oh yes,I'm making leaps an bounds
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that
I've overflowed my cup.
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There're things about all of ya'll have got to understand
Latifah- never was a teacher
Never was a preacher
Never was a saint
Never was conceited 
Never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.
But I never shut up when things piss me off 
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across 
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be
I've got an angel watching over me

(chorus) 2 times
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
Yes he did, yes he did
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
You don't hear me
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world,world,world
The light of my world, my world- AHHHHH yes he did...............",Winki's Theme
Queen Latifah,"[Chorus: x2]
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my queendom to fall.
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot.
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got.

I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up.
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up,
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it.
Who did it, who does it,
From private to public,
Anywhere I'm in there and been there.
So recognize this, who the nicest?
Sit down and settle for your consolation prizes.
Whatever you want, I got.
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop.
So notes, pause another spot.
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you.
Don't try to be me, do you.
Be coo' to you and do you.
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane.
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames.
Leave 'em all with shit stains,
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'.
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's,
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's.
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way,
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day.
And for real, spittin' on imbeciles, and spinnin' wheels
On my six hundred, you want it, you must be blunted.
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin' to me, you gonna fall, we brawl.
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs,
It's the Q-U-double-E-N.
You know how I'm MCin'.

[Chorus: x2]

See, physically you not ready,
Lyrically you not ready,
Mentally, maybe.
Who talks tough, time to get the baby.
No threats or small bets on my bond, we can get it on
From dusk 'til dawn, from night till morn.
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks,
Till one of us admits it's a battle a whisk.
So look, I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker,
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor.
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time?
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now?
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now.
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast,
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'.
You image, your career, lookie here, you whole life is hangin' in the air.
Like a Chandelier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear,
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty.
Even though I'm low-key, you know me.
You be singin' over my tracks like it's karaoke.
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath.
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff,
Droppin' mathematics, layin' you out like craftmatic.
I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static.

And it makes me scared
Because I'm falling in love
And I don't know if you feel the same

I'm taking this time to write you this letter
Cause what we got is good but want to make it better
Yo boo, I'm digging you, you got all of the equipment
Now I'm ready for a commitment

I'm not trying to rush things
Not looking for an engagement ring
But the queen needs a king
And I choose you, cause what we got is in tune
Since you promised me the moon I hope to see it soon
(see it soon)

I heard you left your last cause she was insecure
I'm not tryin' to compare myself but
I got health and wealth
And now you dealing w/ the top shelf
My orgasmic thoughts need support
Thinking of positions you taught
While I stare at the gifts you bought

The things you do for me make you my number one
When you're around I have a lot of fun
Check me now
Like the time we went to six flags
Boostin', tearin off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again
You're more than a lover you my best friend

Do you remember the first time I letcha get it
I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you
Now tell them hookers to stop calling you
I'm dead up I want to wear your name
So I pray and ask god to make you feel the same

Is there a place to ease my mind
(place to ease my mind)
(think about you all the time, yeah)
Show me a sign and wish that you would offer me a sign
Relax my mind

Let me close by saying stop delaying our fate
Let go your fear I'm here come hold your soul make
I want more but I don't want push
It's never to late so be straight
Don't beat around the bush

I'm all woman if you don't feel like I feel that's fine
Let's stay friends but I want you to be mine now check it
But I'll take what I can take it can't get no plainer
With love sincerely yours your boo dana

Oh p.s. guess who's back around
My ex he called me said he bought a house up town
But I told him that my love for you was too strong
Write back and don't make me wait to long

Oh I don't know
Oh I don't know

Well I ain't the one, I could buy you and your whip
Hold your head 'cause I've got so many hits, what?

Just Another Day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the(gunshot), but I'm here to stay

Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day in the neighbor-hood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm wit whateva comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain on day to day
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, tech's, jimmy hat's, in case I need protection
So I land cruise, play I want to be's
A kid in the increase gettin jack right in front of me
So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't want to get wet, so they step
Cause mine's is slighty bigger
But better yet, I'ma threat, so ya better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't want to talk
I stay true blue, I'm hopin it's you too
I got the fever for the flava of a??????
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus: 1x]

[Verse 2]
Time to chill, hit the hill, uptown let's keep it sight's
Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's own tonight
I'm doin the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a D.T.
But it's home, so I flex, get pressure's off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next
Stomach ache, had a steak, and take for a bean pie
Get a final call for the brother in a bow-tie
I'm from little kid's, dream, and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playin wit her son
I pass by a girl wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray their's a hood in heaven
Fake brother's claim their's no shame in they're game
You know my name, show me a real nigga wit a brain
Too it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus: 1x]

[Verse 3]
You know I gotta get props, I can't stop, wit out y'all
I be nothin, no wreckin, no checkin, no rhymin, no cuttin
No stages from pages, no phones, no beeper's
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real like respectin in rule
Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block time to play
It's just another day, around the wha, around the muthafuckin way

And I got down on my knees down on my knees

Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music

Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you

Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?

So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And give a relief from this awful misery?

Oh pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind

Hard to gain, hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone and it hurts so much
Well then why...
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think about it being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me, baby
I don't want to live

Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?

All the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear

I really love you
(I love you)
Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart

Love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart, baby

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together

What love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together",What Love Has Joined Together
Queen Latifah,"You know it's over (yeah)
But you don't wanna say (uh-uh)
You see the writing on the wall but you don't wanna read

And now you're hopin' (yeah)
That there'll be something different (uh huh)
Something to change the circumstances of the way you're livin'

But that's that fantasy
It's that reality
The one you love that keeps on changing personalities
It's always jealousy, too much intensity
I don't remember signing over my I- Identity

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you were so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Something beautiful and bright, it's losing all it's light
on this site somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain
Cue the rain
Why you driving me so insane?
Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so greedy
Baby, you got my heart in chains

Now you met me on the fly
I was, flyin' so high
You said, I can fly too
That's the start of me and you

Chemistry, what a blast
Had us movin' so fast
Oh baby what a ride when my love is the map
(Let's go)

and you like the way I move
In the crowd, still a jewel
Rule it all with these, cause I got that jua de vive

But like Tinkerbell in the story of Pan
I got caught up, and Captain Hook is my man
But I want free love

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Something beautiful and bright, it's losing all it's light
on this site somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain
Cue the rain
Why you driving me so insane?
Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains

If you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you say;
You will never, never break, never break the chains

Cause I gave it to you freely, didn't know you was so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains
Something beautiful and bright, it's losing all it's light
on this site- somebody cue the rain

Cue the rain
Cue the rain
Why you driving me so insane?
Cue the rain
Didn't know you'd be so needy
Baby, you got my heart in chains",Cue the Rain
