Lauren Christy,"And I'm sending you the sky 
And I'm sending you the sea 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

And I'm sending you to heaven 
Heaven has no jealousy 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

Sending you a picture of my bed 
Sending you a picture of a gun 
Sending you a picture of the 
Voice inside my head 

And I'm sending you the sky 
And I'm sending you the sea 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

Sending you my coat to keep you warm 
Sending you a letter with a bomb 
A bomb 
Sending you a picture of 
The calm before the storm 

And I'm sending you the sky 
And I'm sending you the sea 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

And I'm sending you to heaven 
Heaven has no misery 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

Under the junk mail 
In the hallway 
It waits, for you 
A kiss, from me 

And I'm sending you the sky 
And I'm sending you the sea 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

And I'm sending you to heaven 
Heaven has no sodomy 
And it's all for you, for you 
From me, from me, from me 

And I'm sending you the sky 
And I'm sending you the sea",Letter Bomb
Lauren Christy,"Little girls in pretty boxes, high tech sweat and younger skin
We were all delicious and smelled of Arpege
I buzzed my killer in
Bring me the head of Jerry Garcia
Super sex on water skis
Iced decaf and mocchaccino
And a hooker by the grinder please
Magazine, know what I mean
You go on and on and on about stuff I've never seen
Magazine, stuck to my hand
The boys don't ever get it
But the girls all understand
Angel, waffle, women are weird
Tighten up your tail
Throw her on the linoleum and
Harpoon her like a whale
Dad's on drugs, British sex
A rollicking good time
Trust fund kids, when men are pigs
Just cook that little swine

You go on and on and on about stuff I've never seen
Magazine, stuck to my hand

You go on and on and on about stuff I've never seen

Lauren Christy,"I was walking barefoot on St. Paul's bridge
When I saw a man talking to God
He was round and handsome
Anachronistically
A little odd
I overheard his conversation
He said, I can't live in a world devoid of love.
And the voice, the voice was so familiar
It was the voice of Peter Ustinov
Peter, I whispered from the shadows
We've all been damaged by the 20th century
A man like you can talk to God
But can you spare a word for me?
For I have loved you since the time
I saw you in 'The Mouse that Roared'.
That was Peter Sellers, my dear.
Go away, he implored
Chorus:
See, I used to be Ustinov
But used to's no good enough for me
See, I used to be Ustinov
But used to's not good enough for me.
The I blurted out Quo Vadis
Topkapi, ooh yeah Evil Under The Sun.
He waved his hand, It's too late for that.
As you said, the damage has been done.
Then he lifted his body up
To throw himself to a watery grave
Peter, I yelled
What about 'Billy Budd'
The innocent no one could save?
(Repeat chorus)
So tell me what you're dying for
Have you been so disrespected?
He winked at me and said, 'Billy Budd.'
I wrote, starred, and directed.
Then he bowed and kissed my hand
And said, What was I thinking of?
And walked away into the night
The night I saved Peter Ustinov
You used to be Ustinov
But used to's still good enough for me
You used to be Ustinov
But used to's still good enough for me.",The Night I Saved Peter Ustinov
Lauren Christy,"You make me laugh 
You make me cry 
You make me roll around the floor 
Until I die

When you're in your underwear 
You're smarter than the average bear 
You're so impossible

As we look down the road where all the prodigals have walked
One by one the enemy has whispered lies
And led them off as slaves

But we know that you are god yours is the victory
We know there is more to come
That we may not yet see
So with the faith you've given us
We'll step into the valley unafraid, yeah

We call out to dead hearts come alive, come alive
Up out of the ashes let us see an army rise

Lauren Daigle,"God I give You all I can today
These scattered ashes that I hid away
I lay them all at Your feet

From the corners of my deepest shame
The empty places where I've worn Your name
Show me the love I say I believe

Oh Help me to lay it down
Oh Lord I lay it down

Oh let this be where I die
My lord with thee crucified
Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
Once and for all, once and for all

There is victory in my Saviors loss
And In the crimson flowing from the cross
Pour over me, pour over me yes

Long lay the world, in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices

Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy, in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices

He came walkin' out of that Texaco,

George Strait blarin' out of his Silverado.

A fish hook on the bill of his baseball cap:

God, it's good to see a man like that, it takes me back.


'Cause there's just somethin', you know the type:

A southern boy sweet as a Jasmine on a hot, thick summer night.

Kisses that linger a long, long time:

Long after they're gone, they stay on my mind.

Someone my Daddy woulda liked:

The Carolina kind.


I've fallen for a city boy or two.

I've been held in the arms of an Armani suit,

But I've come to learn that ain't me.

No, just gimme a long-haired country boy in his ripped up jeans.

Lauren Talley,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

Waking to the sunlight, being cradled by the moon
Catching fireflies at night, building castles in the sand
Kissing mama's face goodnight and holding daddy's hand
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

Running barefoot through the grass, a little hide and go seek
Being so in love that you can hardly eat
Dancing in the dark when there's no one else around
Being bundled 'neath the covers, watching snow fall to the ground
Thank you, Lord, how could I ask for more?

So many things I thought would bring me happiness
Some dreams that are realities today
Such an irony the things that mean the most to me
Are the memories that I've made along the way

So if there's anything I've learned from this journey I am on
Simple truths will keep you going, simple love will keep you strong

Lauren Wool,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart

Laurence Hobgood,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still

My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Laurent de Wilde,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Laurent de Wilde,"[Chorus]
If I go on my way without you
Whoa where would I go
If I go on my way without you 
Whoa where would I go

I'm having flashbacks
Let me relax my dome
My whole joint's blown another soldier won't be coming home
Parkside is gonna miss you black foreva'
Ties will never sever
You died tryin' to live better
Did what you had to do and now you deceased
I hope you livin' in peace don't even stress that beef
Go 'head and sleep count your blessings return to the essence
every time I see your fam word is bon I feel your presence
it's all over bearing witness like jehovah
ain't nothing strange unless you watch your range like a rover
Follow me son, what's done is done, forgot it
God bless his soul while his body's underground rotting
We won't forget you let a brother try to dis you
I swear to god he better have a blade and plus a pistol
Forever miss you got babies that want to kiss you
Shining like crystal, and at your wake I pass your ma a tissue

[Chorus: x2]

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
He used to talk about the box in the closet 
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, it's ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' with that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin'

[Chorus: x2]

Aye yo my dreams are filled with terror
Shots gettin'' nearer 
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes it's gettin' clearer
A tragedy resulted from a brother's bad scratch 
Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rug rat, somebody tell me where the love's at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

[Chorus: x4]",Move On
Laurent Filipe,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Laurent Garnier,"Deedely dum dum dum, deedely dum dum
This is the mandolin playing the melody
Here comes the man with the mandolin
Mandolin playing melody again
He'll cheer you up 'til your ship comes in
Loveable old fellow playing an old tune
He comes 'round every afternoon
Raggedy old minstrel, wearing a big grin
You'll love the man with the mandolin
All the kids foller, all the kids holler
To the windows above
Mamma throw a nickle and the man wil tick
A little tune we love

Open your heart let the music in

Et que voici les couleurs vives
Et que même si l'amour est parti
Ce n'est que partie remise

Va chercher l'amour en plaine
Tendre la main, faire un sourire, hello
Mais d'autres mains nous retiennent
Appeler un cœur en peine, allp
Mais déjà le train m'entraîne
Derrière les flots bleus de Saint-Malo
J'aurais dû lui dire je t'aime

Il court, il court le temps hélas
Le soleil est en haut
Faisons l'amour avant qu'il passe
Que nos cœurs tombent à l'eau
Car ma chanson est profonde

Il court, il court le temps hélas
Au fil des heures
Faut faire les choses avant qu'elles passent
Qu'elles s'en aillent ailleurs
Et ma chanson est profonde

Et rêver d'un monde tout nouveau
C'est sûrement la vie prochaine
Envoyer la nuit des mots vers le haut
C'est toujours la fois prochaine

Mais que son père se souvienne
Qu'on peut chanter en chœur au bord de l'eau

Des ballons
Des choux à la crème
On était seuls avec ma mère
Tous les deux célibataires

Et puis un jour
On est partis banlieue Est
Maman rêvait toujours de films
De danse, de gestes

Qui rend le coeur sec

Dans la salle de bain
Quand j' faisais mon cirque
Avec ma guitare en plastique
J'aimais me voir

Dans une chanson, un jour, 
Je raconterai mon histoire
Ainsi va la vie

Je savais tôt ou tard
Qu'il fallait m'absenter
En tambours, en guitares
Que j'allais m'envoler

Un tableau très sombre
Me retient toujours
Comme un amour

(Ta)

La nuit souvent j'emprunte
Du temps au labyrinthe
Pour m'allonger dans le tableau
Près d'une épée sortie
Vous: dans l'herbe endormie
Devant un paysage
Votre visage
Qui la nuit vient vers moi
Provocant l'émoi
Que je chante aujourd'hui
Comme un ennui

(Ta)

Alors le vent se lève
Je sens bouger vos lèvres
Et la-bas les soldats
Ne nous voient pas
Votre pourpoint qui s'ouvre
Au loin les tours du Louvre
Le ciel est tourmenté
Par vos beautés

Et mon air et mes mots subtils
Disent que mon cœur en 2010
Voudrait tant, je le sens

Puis il a porté les bagages
De la belle Anglaise
Est là dans la cabine

Je me suis sauvé en Angleterre.
Je faisais le Frenchman, super lover.
Je me teignais les cheveux, les sourcils
Pour être plus brun, pour faire viril.
Carrément débile, je trouve pas mon style.
Carrément débile, je trouve pas mon style.

J'ai chopé la mélancolie
En faisant des chansons sur mon lit,
Une commande pour chanteur pas bien.
Fallait que je dise France Américain.
Ça m'a carrément miné, tout dégoûté,
Carrément miné, tout dégoûté.

Promoteurs, ils voulaient, canailles,
Que je fasse dessous de table, homme de paille,
Construire des tours de carton bleu
Pour que les petits garçons mettent leurs jeux.

More lost without you and so it goes

Laurie Allyn,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled

Stands in the middle of the fields.

Looking like something else

Oh then they slip away into the remains of the day
Oh they slip away.

And how to loose
And how to fight the crippling blues that I was born with

I know he's around when the sky and the ground start in ringing
I know he is near 
By the thunder I hear in advance

His words, his words alone
Are the words that can start my heart singing
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance

He'll sleep and he'll rise
In the light of two eyes that adore him
And bore him it might
But he won't leave my sight for a glance

In every way, every day
I need less of myself and more him, more him
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance

Laurie Beechman,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

Laurie Johnson,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,

Laurie Johnson,"I cover the waterfront,
I'm watching the sea,
Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!

Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

Laurie Johnson,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

Laurie Krauz,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Laurie Krauz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Laurie Krauz,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening

When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Laurie Lewis,"We used to live just on the outskirts of town
When I was a little girl
The bright skies and the forest
And the green fields were my world
Then we moved away into the city
And left the fields of home behind
And now when solitude's so hard to find
My memories take me back in time

Chorus

Where are my green fileds now
No nowhere around
So I'll steal away with my memories
And in green fields I'll lay me down

Now I've got concrete for my front yard 
And it's the same way out in back
But still it fills my heart with happiness
To see green grass push through the cracks

(Chorus)

Well I guess I share the same timeworn dreams
With folks in cities everywhere
To find a little place on God's green Earth
And live in peace and quiet there

Laurie Lewis,"Love comes unbidden, can't be forbidden 
It takes you and shakes you right down to your shoes 
It knows heartache and trial but accepts no denial 
You can't choose who you love, love chooses you 

In the wink of an eye love looses an arrow 
We control it no more than the flight of the sparrow 
The swell of the tide or the light of the moon 
You can't choose who you love, love chooses you 

Tell me now if I'm wrong 
Are you feelin' the same 
Are your feet on the ground 
Are you callin' my name 
Do you lie awake nights 
Please say you do 
'Cause you can't choose who you love 
Love chooses you 

Love cuts like a torch to a heart behind steel 
And though you may hide it, love knows how you feel 
And though you may trespass on the laws of the land 
Your heart has to follow when love takes your hand 

And it seems we're two people within the same circle 
It's drawn tighter and tighter till you're all that I see 
I'm full and I'm empty and you're pouring through me 
Like a warm rain fallin' through the leaves on a tree 

Tell me now if I'm wrong 
Are you feelin' the same 
Are your feet on the ground 
Are you callin' my name 
Do you lie awake nights 
Please say you do 
'Cause you can't choose who you love

Laurie Lewis,"Those Texas bluebonnets how sweetly they grow
   For all the wide prairies they're scattered like snow
   They make all the meadows as blue as the skies
   Reminding me of my little darlings blue eyes

Well I wanted to ramble so I started to roam
And I didn't think twice about leaving my home
But when I got to Texas not far from Burnet
Those Texas bluebonnets wouldn't let me forget

I ran out of money went to work on a farm
Picking their melons and hoeing their corn
And all winter long Lord I herded their cows
And I tried to forget my little darling somehow

But then springtime had blossomed
And it just made my head feel bluer than blue
Those Texas bluebonnets they smiled in the sun
But they just made me think of my only one

I'm leaving the southland I'm leaving today
I don't know where I'm going but I know that I can't stay
I guess I'll go north to the ice and the snow
Where those Texas bluebonnets never will grow

In the cold frozen Iceland I'll live 'til I die
Where I'll finally forget my little darlings blue eyes

Laurie Lewis,"The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

Laurie Lewis,"   
So early on that morning, the moon still way up high
The moon still way up high
Though soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky
I lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes
And dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized

The house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange
I went out by the window to watch the morning change
And just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing
And somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   I know you tried to make me see and no I never would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood

A stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed
He stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care
And I wondered when heÂ'd ramble back or why he ever should 
But I knew that he was just like you and that he never would

   That dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad
   How could I have turned away from the troubles that we had
   Those words you spoke now ring so true just like you said they would
   Too late that dawn the day you left I finally understood

Laurie Lewis,"'Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his while
To waste much time on the old violin
But he held it up with a smile.

What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar - then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who'll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three - But no

From the room far back a gray haired man
Came forward and picked up the bow;
Then wiping the dust from the old violin
And tightening the loose strings
He played a melody pure and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.

The music ceased and the auctioneer
With a voice that was quiet and low
Said What am I bidden for the old violin?
And he held it up with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
Two thousand! And who'll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And going, and gone! said he.

The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply: 
The touch of the master's hand.

And many a man with life out of tune
And battered and scattered with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd
Much like the old violin. 

A ""mess of pottage a glass of wine;
A game - and he travels on.
He's ""going"" once and "" going"" twice
He's ""going"" and ""almost gone."" 

But the Master comes and the foolish crowd
Never can quite understand 
The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought 
By the touch of the Master's hand.

Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which i'll tell
Known as the brave acony bell

Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon

Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world ""why should i wait

Laurie Lewis,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift

Laurie Lewis,"The thrush in the forest, the lark in the field
Sing like their lives depend on the song
My mind has been full, but my voice has been still
In all this time since you've been gone

‘Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road
You and I shouldered a heavy load
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold
You and I, we had a hand to hold

There's an empty room behind my heart's door
And I've tried to fill it by calling your name
But the echoes subside and I know what's in store:
Only the emptiness remains

‘Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road
You and I shouldered a heavy load
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold
You and I, we had a hand to hold

I went out walking, thinking of you
I was filled with self-pity that we had to part
So I picked up a pebble of a pale rosy hue
And I carried it next to my heart
And it's strange, though I know that stone isn't you
It's a talisman that I hold dear
I clasp it tightly, and I don't feel so blue
And somehow, it brings you near

‘Cause you and I, we shared a rocky road
You and I shouldered a heavy load
Ah, but you and I, we had something gold

Laurie Z,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas
Laurie Z,"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stood behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve
 
She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse 
And we laughed until we cried
 
We took her groceries to the check out stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation lagged
 
We went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store 
And we drank it in her car
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how
 
She said she's married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie
 
I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw 
Doubt or gratitude
 
She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was Hell
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving, in our eloquence
Another ""Auld Lang Syne""
 
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away
 
Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And, as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain",Same Old Lang Syne Medley

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,

We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men

Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before my record deal,
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
Kill the guy in Carter park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem

You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got

You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got

Looking back, looking back, looking back

A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu
Main street roots tonic with the dreds
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave.
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker

July 4th races off of Parker
Fireworks at Martin stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggas be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self-Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state
And everybody used to do the wop
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party

What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

I wrote these words for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception, instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that

Everything is everything
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that

Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually",Everything Is Everything
Lauryn Hill,"It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way?
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin', It ain't workin' (No, it ain't workin')
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (This is crazy, uh-huh!)

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do
You let go, and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin', It ain't workin' (It ain't workin')

Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse it's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce, two people both equal
Like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it
You can't stop it, drop it
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness
First handed I'm candid
You can't stand it, respect demanded
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel

I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball
While my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it
For a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in The Bible, like Moses and Aaron
Things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through, let God redeem you
Keep your deen true
You can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to
Observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73 Psalm
'Cause with all this going on I got the world in my palm

You can get the power!

You can get the money!
You can get the power!

Now I be breaking bread sipping
Manichevitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie
I makes a lot like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

Fling skin grin while them plotting for you, true!

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Me nah tellin' them no more)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Be real, them not a clue!)
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you

They say all the right things, to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do

Why every Indian want to be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef

Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gonna idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin', gunnin' I stand position

Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uh

Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves

That everyday people, they lie to God too

The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man

He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses blurred my sight
I used to love him but now I don't

I used to love him but now I don't
I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen

Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated

For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone

And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Father you saved me and showed me that life

Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished

Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul

And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with
I used to love him but now I don't",I Used to Love Him

Lauryn Hill,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one

The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I try to be, what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help

Lauryn Hill,"Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small

See nothin' even matters
See nothin' even matters at all
Nothin' even matters

See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothin' even matters at all

Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters at all

Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothin' even matters to me

You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously, baby
'Cause nothin' even matters to me

Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters to me
Said I don't, my baby, baby

Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
'Cause nothin' even matters no more

See nothin', it don't matters
See nothin' even matters no more
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters no more

Now my team could score
And make it to the final four
Just repossess my 4 x 4
'Cause nothin' even matters no more

Nothin' even matters

Come on baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher?

Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?

Now, who you know without any flaws?
That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

Come on baby light my fire

How come we ain't gettin no higher?

I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?

Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak?  uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto supastar since my first album _blunted_
I used to work at foot locker, they fired me and fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it however do you want it!
Now you get it, writing rhymes, in the range, with the frames
Lightly tinted, then send it to your blcok to have my full name
Cemented (lauryn hill!)  and if your lines sound like mine
I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!) unprecedented, and still respected
When it's finished, I'm serious, I'm takin over areas in aquarius
Runnin red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as christ was a superstar, you stupid, star
They hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

Lauryn Hill,"The sweetest thing I`ve ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn`t get so weak
Ooo, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you`re in love with me
See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

I get mad when you walk away (don`t walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black

Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

It was the...Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it`s in vain

Speaking on my mother`s phone
The touching makes me think I`m grown, (you ain`t grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armoretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I`m, I`m not alone

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know",Sweetest Thing [Mahogany Mix][*]

Lauryn Hill,"Fell real good wavin' your hands in the air
Admit two shots in the atmosphere
Put 'em up, put 'em up

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim

To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again

Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just the minimum
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails up out Koreans

Come again
Yo, when when come again
When when come again
My friend come again

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend poppin' game, like you got yen

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?

Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out 
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices
Praying to the alter of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else

He takes the unsuspected
'cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives

Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual

Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue
'cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""
So she lay with him to see how good it feels

Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
'cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion,
Next time just use protection

Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust,
Both of them were dealt to us
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion,
They can't even entertain the solution,
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution

Hiding from the truth,
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done

Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies

Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,
To this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do,
He will try us

Just don't regress,
Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love,
He won't deny us,

And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now",Adam Lives in Theory

Submitted to committing election

Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection

And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete

We belong, the true enemies defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me

Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in

Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity

The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for

Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb is Saddam and Minister Farakkkhan
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you
What authority do we do
When the majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses

Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Text book solutions are so improbable
'cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
...behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect, 'cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
'cause I... can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be in sanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God (?) don't need material

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord, with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall correct our paths
Be (?) you can follow him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping them from perfection

Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
...fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, He's in live in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit
Without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
...for why would he die
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and his word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection

This neurotic toxic society

Sick cycle psychology in desperate need of psychiatry
Exorcism, sobriety, forcing social lobotomies
People stuck in dichotomies, pseudo-sicko anxieties
Serial criminals dressed in variety
Social transvestisms, subliminal dressed up as piety
Transforms projections like Cartesian images
Robbing innocence, stealing inheritance
Quiet victims with no defense portrayed over dollars and cents
Maladjusted ignorant malediction and dissonance
Too much addiction, no consciousness
Don't trust it, this cosmology is busted
Broken returns to the dusted, stems of corruption
Oppression, deceit, abuse and repeat
They don't feel complete unless they're robbing the sheep
Man is not a product if you call it that then stop it

But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

Will you still love me tomorrow

LaVern Baker,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet, darling, I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I come running back for more

For falling in love with you.
And, fool that I am,

And, my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette.

Fool that I am,
For hoping you'd understand.
And thinking you
Would listen, too,
And, oh, the things I had planned.

But we couldn't see eye to eye

YOU NEVER LET ME KNOW THE WAY YOU'RE FEELING.

YOU'RE HURTING AND I KNOW IT
BUT YOU'VE NO WAY TO SHOW IT.
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE IT'S NOTHING BUT YOUR PRIDE.

YOU'VE BUILT A LOT OF WALLS UP HIGH AROUND YOU.
I CAN'T BEGIN TO SEE JUST WHERE YOU LIVE.

OR EVEN REARRANGING,
BUT IF YOU DON'T, THEN SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.
COME ON AND CRY, BABY
AND LET YOUR TEARS HANG OUT.

YOU'RE SO MUCH IN CONTROL,
DOWN TO YOUR VERY SOUL.
YOU NEVER LET WHAT BOTHERS YOU COME THROUGH.
AND YET YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE
WHENVER I DESPAIR.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

I'M WAITING HERE WITH ARMS THAT WANT TO HOLD YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING I WON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CHANGES COMING OVER ME.
NOTHING CAN GET ME DOWN.

I KNOW THE BLUES ARE OUT OF TOWN.

Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Lawless,"Intro:
[Frost]: This is a dramatization. The names have been changed to protect
the innocent ones not involved in the stories I'm about to tell. So 
listen up and listen up well. Here are the true accounts and incidents 
and still to me, it makes no sense. Ignorance is a major role, but 
here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Lawrence,"It's burning and it's burning, it's burning,
A fire inside that I just don't believe
Some call it anger, some say frustration
But I think I call this big greed
This time the circus has left without us
And we could run away
The french is the center now,
Hey boys that's great

when I woke up in hawthorne,
I took ocean down to the fairground to see everyone
So beautiful that I drown in the waves of the haircuts
Spin kicks and jumps
Well I got my bottled water and my nachos,
It came in under twenty bucks
I got this bad taste in the back of my mouth
From my time on the back of a bus

this summer vacation, it's cheap and it's true
It's ideals are intact, it's the best we can do
This time you turn into your own enemy
Not sell outs but dictated economies

(whoo!)

these thieves, these thieves in their flip-flops and bro attitudes
Are the very reason we do what we do
When I say fuck the man, it's what I believe
No matter who that man happens to be.
No matter who that man happens to be.

this kevin or that one, it all seems the same
Exploit the avenues, fix all the gains
Maybe they'll buy everything that you sell
But I'm outside these fences,
Rolling fast down that hill...

for your empty tale
Mother fucker!

Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,

Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

Lawrence Welk,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood

For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three.

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel

Lawrence Welk,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Lawrence Welk,"'Tention folks, speak of jokes
This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes

Lawrence Welk,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town
Lawrence Welk,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Lawrence Welk,"Though we're called a people of serious mind,
'Tis often we dance, 'tis often we sing.

And bein' as human as all human-kind,
We aren't superior to havin' a fling.
I'm taking the fling of a lifetime.
The fling of a husband and wife-time.

A-when I a-went romancing
I a-gave no thought to any wedding ring.
Every bonnie lassie was
My highland fling.

A-no chance was I chancing
I' a-m not the man ya dangle on a string.
I was canny waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

A-though I danced each girl in a twist and a-twirl
Ney one would do.
And I went a-my way 'til the fatal day
In the fling I was flung a-with you.
Oh

Now my heart is prancin'
A-gay as a lark and happy as a king.
The years I'll weather, in the hame on the heather,
With my one and only highland fling.
I thought you were fallin' for Andy MacPherson.

Ney, ney. He became an impossible person.
But what about you and that Connie MacKenzie?
She talked when I putted and drove me to frenzie.
But what of the lad known as Bobby MacDougal?

It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal.
And weren't ya daft about Megan McDerrmot?
I tasted her cooking. T'would make me a hermit.
How jealous I was of McDonald McCutcheon.

His neck had a head on, but there wasn't much in.
And what about Sandy?

His hands were too handy.
And wasn't there a Jenny?

I'm not wantin' any
I'm not wantin' any but you.

When I went a-dancin'
No special lad I was encouragin'.
Every lackly laddie was
My highland fling.

No glance I was glancin'.
Well, nothin' really worth a-mentionin'.
Hopin', watchin', waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

Though they spoke me soft in the moonlit oft',
Ney one would do.
'Til it came to pass to this lucky lass
In a fling I was flung with you.
Oh

Now my heart is prancin'.
Nothin' about ya I'd be alterin'.
The years I'll weather, in the hame on the heather,
With me one and only highland fling.",My One and Only Highland Fling
Lawrence Welk,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven (Shure They Call It Ireland) [*]
Lawrence Welk,"The sun is shinin', oh, happy day-ay
No more troubles and no skies are gray-ay
Ever since you said those words to me
Doo-doom, dah-doo-dad-doo-dah-doo-doo

You said you loved me, I know it's tru-ue
My life's complete, dear, for now I have you-ou

Lawrence Welk,"Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

So I'll pray for you, every single day for you
It will see me through like a charm until you return
Give me something, something to remember you by
When you are far away from me",Something to Remember You By
Lawrence Welk,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love
Lawrence Welk,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Lawrence Welk,"Though you belong
To somebody else,
Tonight you belong to me.
Though we're apart,
You're part of my heart,
Tonight you belong to me.
Down by the stream, 
How sweet it will seem,
Once more to dream in the moonlight.
Though with the dawn, 
I know when you're gone,
Tonight you belong to me.",Tonight You Belong to Me
Lawrence Welk,"Marianne, oh, Marianne, oh, won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes
If mama don't know now, she can guess  
My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw
Children by the dozen in and out the bamboo hut 
One for every palm tree and coconut  
Hurry up now
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
