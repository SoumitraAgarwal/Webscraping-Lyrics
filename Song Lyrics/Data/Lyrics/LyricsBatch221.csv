Put on your Sunday, go to meetin'
And I'll take you by the hand
If you will be my dancin' partner
We will dance to beat the band

Your pa will understand

Oh, choose partners, skip to my lou

Judy Garland,"Come on and hear (2x), Alexander's Ragtime Band,
Come on and hear (2x), it's the best band in the land!
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,
So natural that you want to go to war--
That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb!
Come on along (2x), let me take you by the hand
Up to the man (2x), who's the leader of the band,
And if you want to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear (2x), Alexander's Ragtime Band!




",Alexander's Ragtime Band
Judy Garland,"Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless nights were not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together, together, together
If we're alone together",Alone Together
Judy Garland,"I'll remember forever
When I was but three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown",Be a Clown
Judy Garland,"""Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina""

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.",Carolina in the Morning
Judy Garland,"I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you, 
Come rain or come shine. 
High as a mountain and deep as a river, 
Come rain or come shine. 

I guess when you met me 
It was just one of those things, 
But don't ever bet me, 
""Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me. 

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me, 
Come rain or come shine. 
Happy together, unhappy together 
And won't it be fine. 

Days may be cloudy or sunny, 
We're in or we're out of the money, 
But I'm with you always, 
I'm with you rain or shine.",Come Rain or Come Shine
Judy Garland,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.
A cottage for sale.",A Cottage for Sale
Judy Garland,"After that sweet Summer afternoon
When for the first time I saw you appear,
Dreaming of you I composed a tune,
So will you listen to it, dear?

Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you, do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day,
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?
Isn't heaven forever more?

Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do,
Just as you love me?

Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you, do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day,
What would life be?
Will I leave you, never?
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?
Isn't heaven forever more?

Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see,
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do,
Just as you love me?",Do I Love You?
Judy Garland,"You really shouldn't have done it,
You hadn't any right.
I really shouldn't have let you kiss me.
And although it was wrong,

I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it,
And you know you shouldn't have done it,
Oh, do it again.

I may cry no, no, no, no, no, but do it again.
My lips just ache to have you take
The kiss that's waiting for you.
You know if you do you won't regret it.

Come and get it.
Oh, no one is near,
I may cry oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, but no one can hear.
Mama may scold me 'cause she told me 

It was naughty but then, please, do it again.
Yes do it again, and again and again and again and again.
Turn out the light.
And hold me close in your arms

All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say goodbye and amen.
But until then, please do it again.",Do It Again
Judy Garland,"You sons of Adam, you daughters of Eve
The time has come to take, your love-torn hearts off your sleeve
Look, look about you, what, what do you see?
Love-sick, love-lorn, love-wrecked, love-worn, boo hoomanity

There'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe
Are we mice or are we men? Can't you see the light?
Come you fellow victims lets unite

Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that mood and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love, let's liquidate all its friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbows ends
Down with songs that mourn about night and day
Down with love, just take it away, away
Take it away, take it away

Give it back to the birds and the bees and the V and E's
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid
Down with signs, down with Cupid
Ruttle that stuff that duff

Down with love
Down with love
Down with love
Down, down, down with love

",Down With Love
Judy Garland,"Don't ever leave me, now, that you're here
Here is where you belong
Everything seems alright when you're near
When you're away, it's all wrong

I'm so dependent
When I need comfort I always run to you

Don't ever leave me 'cause if you do
I'll have no one to run to

",Fly Me to the Moon
Judy Garland,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day
Judy Garland,"From this moment on,
You for me dear,
Only two for tea dear,
From this moment on,

From this happy day,
No more blue songs,
Only hoop-de-doo songs,
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I babe
We'll be ridin' high babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on.

Judy Garland,"It seems like happiness is just a thing called Joe
He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know

Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe

Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe",Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe
Judy Garland,"Hey look me over, lend me an ear
Fresh out of clover, mortgage up to here
Don't pass the plate folks, don't pass the cup
I figure whenever you're down and out, the only way is up
And I'll be up like a rosebud high on the vine
Don't thumb your nose, but take a tip from mine
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some
And look out world, here I come

Nobody in the world was ever without a prayer
How can you win the world if nobody knows you're there?

Kid, when you need the crowd, the tickets are hard to sell
Still, you can lead the crowd if you can get up and yell

Hey look me over, lend me an ear
Fresh out of clover, mortgage up to here
I'm a little bit short of the elbow room, so let me get me some
And look out world, here me shout world
And look out world, here I come","Hey, Look Me Over!"
Judy Garland,"Goodbye, No use leading with our chins,
This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Judy Garland,"I believe in doing what I can
In crying when I must
In laughing when I choose
Hey ho, if love were all

I should be lonely.
I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose.

Although when shadows fall
I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me
Someone affectionate and dear

Cares would be ended if I knew that he
Wanted to have me near.
But I believe that since my life began
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse.

Where fashion sits?

Co-pants with stripes, and cut away,
Coat, perfect fits?

Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.

Walk with sticks, or umbrellas,

Spangled gowns upon a beauty of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie,
All misfits.

Judy Garland,"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean.
That's entertainment!
The lights on the lady in tights
Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.
The guy who was waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone

To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

And you care for me!",Who Cares?
Judy Garland,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two.

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Till I say to myself

Get ahold of yourself!
Can't you see that it never can be?
You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise

That toddlin' town, the toddlin' town

I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues 
In Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street
I just want to stay, I just want to stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago

Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chica-are-are-go
Let me cool my heels ri-ight down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with me along the lake
To the drake Hollar and Hoot, all through the loop
Shout how-now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she, she, life is peachy

Chicago, we'll meat at the pump room, Ambassador East
To say the least, on shish kabab
And breast of squad we will and get fleeced

With plenty of currency
We'd open up the safe but we forgot where we put the key

But how are we to get there, that's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue
But we haven't got a yacht
We would ride up the avenue
But the horse we had was shot
We would go on a trolleycar

But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a dying ember
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember it came

Love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name
Love is almost never ever the same

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure
Love can bring you fame
Love fresh as the morning
May be wild when it's 'borning

Judy Garland,"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
When the universe reels

The day was bright, the air was sweet
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak

Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings

But what I said still goes,

No love, no nothin',
And that's a promise I'll keep,
No fun with no one,
I'm getting plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir! No nothin',
Till my baby comes home

Judy Garland,"Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade

Don't tell me not to leave
Just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade

I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir
I guess I didn't make it

But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
A Cinderella or a shine apple of an eye
I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy and you see
I gotta have my bite, sir

Get ready for me love
'Cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade

Yes, sir
No, sir
I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want, I know how
All that the law will allow
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw that bell will go clang
Though I'm alone I'm a gang
Eye on the target and wham
One shot, one gun shot and bam

Hey, world, here I am
Get ready for me life, 'cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer
Nobody, no, nobody, is gonna rain on my parade!",Don't Rain on My Parade
Judy Garland,"When the sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singing like they did before

That old storm broke out
And my man went off and left me in the rain
Though he's gone I doubt
If he'll stay away for good, I'd stop living if he would

Love is funny
It's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the storm clouds came
I'll never be the same

'Til the sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door

Love is funny
It's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the storm clouds came
I'll never be the same

'Til the sun comes out
And the rain stops beating on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour
It will not be long before
There's a knocking at my door
And you'll know the man love
Walked in when the sun comes out

",As Long as He Needs Me [Video Only]
Judy Garland,"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat
Oh, be swift, my soul to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy let us die to make men free
While God is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

Amen",Battle Hymn of the Republic
Judy Garland,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams,
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.

Oh, where's that worn out wish that I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

Judy Garland,"The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gray
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me",I Left My Heart in San Francisco

Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road

Look up, look up and greet your maker,
For Gabriel blows his horn.

Weary, totin' such a load,
Travelin' down that lonesome road,
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on.

Judy Garland,"Little drops of rain, little grains of sand
Makes the mighty ocean and the pleasant land
Little notes that sing, little words that rhyme
Make the mighty memories and the dreams of time

Never let a minute lie there on the shelf
For there maybe in it all love's life itself
Little smiles of hope, little drops of tears
Make this thing [Incomprehensible], go dancing down the years

Little drops of rain, little rays of sun
Make the hope for rainbow, glow for everyone

",Lost in the Stars
Judy Garland,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",Me and My Shadow

And though they do their best to give me consolation

But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a dying ember
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember it came

Love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain

Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure

Judy Garland,"A lady known as Paris, Romantic and Charming
Has left her old companions and faded from view

Lonely men with lonely eyes are seeking her in vain
Her streets are where they were, but there's no sign of her

She has left the Seine

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafÃ¢??

The last time I saw Paris, her trees were dressed for spring,
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them
Old women, selling flowers, in markets at dawn

Children who applauded, Punch and Judy in the park
And those who danced at night and kept our Paris bright

'Til the town went dark.",The Last Time I Saw Paris
Judy Garland,"Why do stage struck maidens clamor
To be actin' in the drammer?

We've heard say
You are gay
Night and day.

Oh, go 'way!

We drink water from a dipper,
You drink champagne from a slipper.

Tho' it seems cruel to bust
All your dreams,
Still I must;
Here's the truth I tell you:
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.
When you let a feller hold your hand (which
means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: ""Ain't her life a whirl?""
Though you're warned against a ""rout""
Ruining your reputation,
I have played around
The one night trade around
A great big nation:
Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl.

Though we've listened to you moan and grieve, you
Must pardon us if we do not believe you,
There is no doubt
You're crazy about
Your awful stage!

I admit it's fun
To smear my face with paint,
Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,
And I like to play a demi-mondy role
With soul!
Ask the hero does he
Like the way I lure
When I play a hussy
Or a paramour,
Yet when once the curtain's down
My life is pure,
And how I dread it!

Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes,
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.

If some gentleman would talk with reason
I would cancel all next season.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl!

You'd be back the season after!",Life upon the Wicked Stage

I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You
Judy Garland,"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more",Maggie Maggie May
Judy Garland,"Meet me tonight in dreamland,
Under the silv'ry moon.
Meet me tonight in dreamland,
Where love's sweet roses bloom.

In your dear eyes of blue.

There let my dreams come true.

And the moon am a shinin' from above
Cupid am a callin' every Jack and Jill
It's just about the time for making love
Someone is a-waiting all along for me
No more hesitating, I must go and see
""How dee do, Dear, it's with you dear
That I love to be""

Put your arms around me, Honey, hold me tight
Huddle up and cuddle up with all your might
Oh! Oh! Won't you roll those eyes?
Eyes that I just idolize
When they look at me, my heart begins to float
Then it starts a rockin' like a motor boat
Oh! Oh! I never knew any girl like you

Music am a-playin' such a ""Loving Glide""
That my feet keep a moving to and fro
And with you a-swayin', I'll be satisfied
To dance until we hear the roosters crow
I love seven 'leven, I love chicken too
Nearest thing to heaven is to be with you
For I'm spoony, moony, loony, but my love is true

Judy Garland,"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in

Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do

Do it again.
I may say no. no. no. no. no.

To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you

I may cry oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh

Judy Garland,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",'I Like Men' Medley: I Like Men/You Make Me Feel So Young/Tess's Torch

Let me go 'way from this lonely town
Won't be long till my song will be true

Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul

The wind blows memories through my hall
And I am all alone on New Year's eve 
The time I need you most of all

And blow their stupid little horns
At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne 
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine

I wish you a Happy New Year darling 
May your new love be bright and fair
I hope he'll do those special things for you

And the wind that follows after
For one certain face
And an unforgotten laughter

I've been following signs
I've been searching through the lands
For a certain pair of arms
And a certain pair of hands

Yes, I tried a kiss here
And I tried a kiss there
For when you're out in company
The boys and girls will pair

But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
An occasional sunset reminded me
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree

Or one red star hung low in the west
Or a heart-break call from a Meadow Lark's nest
Made me think for a moment, maybe, it's true
I found him in the star, in the call, in the blue

But it never was you
It never was anywhere you
Anywhere, anywhere you

That I one time had a house
With so many rooms I couldn't count them all!
I'll bet you couldn't imagine
I had fifteen different beaus
Who would beg and beg to take me to a ball.

I'll bet you couldn't picture me
The time I went to Paris in the Fall,
And who would think the man I loved was quite so handsome,
Quite so tall?

Well it's true, (something cool)
It's just a memory I have; (something cool)
One I almost forgot
'Cause the weather's so hot!
And I'm feeling so bad (something cool)

Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle

Come rain, come shine

Has his lunacy
In the way he works his dream off,

Like to let my kind of steam off!

Doves coo-coo,
Ah, but I;

Because I'm nobody's baby now

Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""

Judy Garland,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Judy Garland,"I was resting comfortably, face down in the gutter
Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

Now you're here and now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear, I found my way
For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day",Just in Time [DVD]

You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold

Judy Garland,"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call
The writings on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But, fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no letup the live-long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away

Judy Garland,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

That seems so bright

On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung
When we were young last night","Last Night When We Were Young [From ""In the Good Old Summer Time""]"

Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart

Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine

Judy Garland,"The bells are ringing for me and my gal.
The birds are singing for me and my gal.
Ev'rybody's been knowing to a wedding they're going.
And for weeks they've been sewing every Suzie and Sal.
They're congregating for me and my gal.
The parson's waiting for me and my gal.
And sometime I'm gonna build a little home for two for three or four or more

Judy Garland,"When Louis came home to the flat,
He hung up his coat and his hat,
He gazed all around, but no wifey he found,
So he said ""where can Flossie be at?""
A note on the table he spied,
He read it just once, then he cried.
It ran, ""Louis dear, it's too slow for for me hear,
So I think I will go for a ride.""

""Meet me in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair,
Don't tell me the lights are shining
any place but there,
We will dance the Hoochee Koochee,
I will be your tootsie wootsie,
If you will meet in St. Louis, Louis,
Meet me at the fair.""

The dresses that hung in the hall,
Were gone, she had taken them all,
She took all his rings and the rest of his things,
The picture he missed from the wall.
""What! moving!"" the janitor said,
""Your rent is paid three months ahead.""
""What good is the flat?"" said poor Louis, ""Read that.""
And the janitor smiled as he read.

You'd play hooky from school
Good old summertime
You'd play ""ring-a-rosie""

We now fondly treasure
When we never thought it a crime
To go stealing cherries
With faces brown as berries

Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

You're better better than a dream
What you are is better far better than a dream
Well I tried to picture your face
But now I see you you're out of this world you're out of this sphere you're out of that outer space

What is real is more ideal than a dream
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream

Can I still be asleep on the couch there
Can this girl be really here

Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept all year

To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me

Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

I've realized his grace is what I need
When sin demanded justice for my soul

From the cross He built a bridge to set us free

And makes the sacrifice so hard to see
As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away
And as evil tried to stop redemption's flow

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

Judy Koch,"Had an uncle named Matthew
He was his father's only boy
Born just south of Cobly, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy

Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

And all the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had

Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun
 
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped them clean

He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family Bible
Faith as solid as a stone

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my Daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend

So, I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him the song is sung
 Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a view beneath the sun

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky

Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love is just the way to live and die
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue is just a Kansas summer sky","Matthew, John Denver"

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams

But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Judy Mowatt,"No sun will shine in my day today
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
I said darkness has covered my light,
and has changed my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found
Won't someone help me
'Cause sweet life must be somewhere to be found

Instead of concrete jungle
Where the living is hardest
Concrete jungle
Man and woman have to do their best.
No chains around my feet
But still I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
I've never known what happiness is
I've never known what sweet caress is
I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't somebody help me?
'Cause my sweet life must be somewhere out there to be found
Instead of a concrete jungle
Where the living is hardest

A woman has to do her best

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve

In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Shining in her eye

Judy Roberts,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

Judy Roberts,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Daughter                 There's many problems in the world, it's so scary

When I woke up this morning

It is no wonder
I truly feel blessed

Brought a miracle today				
				
Now when there's dark clouds

When trouble appears
And is planning to stay
He is waiting near

Judy Welden,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Make a Difference (W/Finney Girls)

I had a dream that forever changed my life
I was redeemed through holy sacrifice
I close my eyes to shut out all His pain
Yet clear as glass I see it all again

I see the cross, the cross of Calvary
I see the one, who died for you and me
I see the blood on the path where He was led
A crown of thorns, held tightly on His head

(CHORUS)
My precious Lord relieved me of my sins
He sealed my fate for all eternity
My heart will be filled with joy again
Oh, precious Lord, when you return for me

As I awoke I saw a light so clear
Then Jesus spoke and took away my fear
I'll spread the word of His redeeming  grace
Open your heart and feel the Lord's embrace

He'll give you peace, just like he's done for me
If you believe, He will set you free
For that's the key that will open up the door
So you can dwell with the Lord forever more

All during their growing years
I ran my business on the phone
And was there to dry their tears
So that when they each would leave the nest
I could rest assured I'd given them my best
And now... my wings have come unfurled 
Have things I must inform the world
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling' me
Honey, you're too old

I've got the too old blues
Been hearing it far too long
It makes no sense... so it's time to scold
When I have so much to give
Why does it matter how long I've lived
I look and think and act young
Write unique songs that must be sung
I'm not useless, I'm strong and bold
So stop giving me those Too Old Blues

Worked so hard, saved some cash
Supported my loved ones dreams
Found energy to work on mine
And surprising as it seems
True friends took notice of my goals
Kept saying hey girl... you owe this to yourself
Pursue that dream while there's still time
Found the door and paid my dime
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling me

When Billy stopped by in his pick up truck
He said ""Darlin', you?re not ready to go
Doncha know we had a date for the rodeo""
Then he said (spoken)

Take off that fancy dress
And them high heeled shoes
Put on your snake-skinned boots
And your faded blues
We're goin' to the square danc 
To doe se doe
After the barrel racin' at the rodeo

Instead of that silly 'ole rodeo
It's gettin' so boring each Saturday night
Watching rope tyin', bull ridin' and cowboy fights""

How come I never get to wear a fancy dress
He's got me livin' out here in the rugged west
One of these days I'm gonna put my foot down 
And make him take me to a dinner and show in town
						
He read my  mind 'cause he said? (spoken)

The Pastor's son who filled my girlhood dreams
We shared singing and a strict upbringing
And to this day I remember our song
And I wonder (spoken)
Whatever happened to Nathaniel Strong

A couple we knew made out in back of Miller's Dam
They married quickly and soon were pushing a pram
They'd been better off at the movies, it seemed to us
But we followed the rules and didn't make a fuss

Chasing a dream keeps boredom at bay
When I'm chasing a dream
My work seems like play
And there's a reason to face each new day
When I'm chasing a dream
When I'm chasing a dream

Early on in life I was always dreaming
Never a day went by that I wasn't scheming
One wish came true I'll not forget 
The day I became a majorette

Lying in bed I'd dream of the man I'd marry
Later I thought of the child I'd some day carry
Blessed with both, but needed more from life
Than being a mother and a wife

My goal these days is to be a hit songwriter
A little success has made the challenge lighter
And if I set my sights sky high
This dream could last until I die

And a rainbow's no longer in view

After a tender kiss they lingered in each other's arms
So turned off, you insisted we leave then and there
The fire in my heart had four alarms

(""House of the Risin' Sun"" melody)

There is a church outside of town
It's called the risen son
The builder had great plans but died
Before the inside was done

Brother Ben carved God's commandments
In marble on ten walls
Was centered on a wooded lot
Far from shopping malls

Now this strategy using ten walls
Formed a definite decagon
The most unusual church around
Though Ben's gone, it lives on

[Instrumental]
The lovely stained glass skylight
Shows the Savior with a smile
His arms are reaching heavenward
Rising from the golden tile

Oh, I love to go inside that church
Even though it's not complete
I find such peace and solace there
As I pray, standing 'neath his feet

Perhaps this church called the risen son
In the Father's eyes is done
No pulpit or pews are needed there
To pray to Him, one on one

Oh, how I love to worship Him there
In the Church Called the Risen Son

I can't earn it, still it's close as a prayer
It goes far beyond the rainbow's end

No humble Hannah, life was a game
I had to be in charge and call each shot
I sped in high gear on a fast freight train
'Til GRACE appeared and changed the plot

Still she smiles and tries to please
Though treated like she has a contagious disease

Forgives and protects the cause of the pain
She knows she's put on permanent hold

We go round & round, up & down
Our love is like a roller coaster ride
Round & round, up & down
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  [3x]
Like a roller coaster ride

Lyrics: Judy Welden

Judy Welden,"SHADES OF BLUE

Spoken:  What makes you think you can waltz back into my life again 
			
(Chorus)
How many shades of blue
Are you gonna dish me out today
How many shades of blue
Before I kiss you goodbye and say
This is the way it's gotta be
I'm leavin'...doncha see
You've played with my heart too long
Your many shades of blue
Have only made me strong

Powder blues' the color used
To describe my milder shade of blue
Ever since the day we met
Even then you made me fret
And sky blues' the color of your eyes
The very ones that told me tons of lies

(CHORUS)

Royal is the brightest blue
That one proved my loyalty to you
Like a puppet you could mold
I would melt 'til you turned cold
I found aqua blues' your fickle side
Walked in and out of my life just like the tide

(CHORUS)

The darkest shade was navy blue
That was when I waved goodbye to you
I was watchin' from the train
You were standin' in the rain
There was nothing more that you could do
You'd given me too many shades of blue

Too many shades of blue

Judy Wexler,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
Judy Wexler,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he

Chill, I got all the girls checkin' me
They know I'm a dog, but they love my pedigree

Yeah, just call me Mr. Orgasm
And if you come with me, I guarantee you're gon' have one
Hottest in the hood, freshest on the block
Why stop on this Gucci and this Louis that I rock?

And everything her momma gave her, she know how to shake
Thicker than a milkshake, and I'm tryin'a get a taste

Her hair did, manicure, pedicure, attitude like Vivica
When she play, they set it off
She feelin' my swag, she feelin' my G
Not only is she dancing, she feeling on me, and I'm feeling you too

So I put my hands on her
Just to let her know the feeling's mutual
Lil' mama, we can birthday text
Yes I said text, but I know you know what I really meant

Tell me what you will do, tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you don't know how to do so I can show you

Get up and strive, but um, get up and roll, get up ya know
Get up and go, these motherfuckers ain't lettin' us go 
So we get up and take it, get up and make it happen for us
Nobody can gt up and take this

Don't you believe me, won't you believe me?

On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
Uptown yea we headed up a one-way, her head is in my lap
So I let her do her one thang
She was Jamaican so I fed her bread and dumplings
Veggie pads and rumcake
Told her, said she's 18 and lived crazy just like me

Eighties baby just like me so
Hey baby you know what your boy holds all night
Long pipe, long strokes

Juelz Santana,"[Verse]
I make music I consider a challenge
Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggaz is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island, woah
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggaz still want beef than holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons, cocaine lessons, just a plot of towers
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up
Niggaz back up, or lift us back up

[Chorus: 2x]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, okay

[Verse]
Now let me hear you say, OKAY
It's Santana the great again, tie him up, bandana his face again
I tried to tell 'em it's no escaping the basics
And no escaping the hatred and no escaping the matrix man
Only Neo is me, no Cleo can see my future, if she did I'd shoot her
They tried to say the mission was impossible
I came through, crew did it, got it poppin' too
Two bitches on my side both prostitutes
Gray smoke, mobster's suit, yeah they get it poppin' too
I get my ace holes chopped in two, dimes, quarters, rocks in two
The fiends cop it too
Yeah, look at 'em rockin' two, rockin' boat, Rock n' Jock
Stop and plot, hot a BLDAT
Fucka, this nigga gotta stop, out of sight, out of mind
He gotta go, he out of line

Okay, okay, okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, OKAY","Okay, Okay"
Juelz Santana," 

(Verse)
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light, all of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin, like it never happened
I got a sick sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an Island somewhere, yeah, I designed just for my mommy
My whole life is a blessing, that's why I'm so nice, so right
Approach mics with aggression
I got the type of obsession I would like to progress in
I write about me, and the life of my henchmen
I blow dice, roll twice to the deuce
That was nights, that was life on the stoop
This shit gotta change
Can't forget the hard white in the boot
White car stripped with the blue, narc parked right in the coup, damn
They riding around with a license to shoot
I'm riding around with no license and hoop, follow me now
Follow me down, this yellow brick road
187, hello, every ghettos zip code
I had to change my pace up, so I went left, while everybody went right
Had to switch the waste up, now I'm better off
Met Cam set it off, did the mix tape now look dip set is off
Put the bid in Def Jam bet it all
First writers refusal, Dame wouldn't let us off
So we matched it, we signed labels with Dashius
Cam goes platinum, the set is up next
A double album, we set for the best
Juelz is the test, which is me, fail or succeed
But still I'm here in the flesh, handing you breath
Mixed with a lot of thought, The Santana, Robb Report
I bring you more than just music I bring you me and all of my movement
I bring my whole life all in the booth shit
And I'm all in the booth with, the headphones on, the lights cut down
And all of this true shit",One Day I Smile
Juelz Santana,"Ya probably ain't expecting this one
Nope,yea clap clap un hun,
This something my grandmother would dance to or something
Sha ba doop doop doo
Sha ba doop doop doo

[Chorus]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall
(i know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drop would fall

Ay Grandma and Grandpa
Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know its killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer,but I don't I'm jus wishin for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, she's watchin her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes, she so proud of her son
See right through my mamma eyes, she jus follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls, has a drop a pain involved,you better believe
88 cocaine it solves, now the dope came in charge yup
I see my niggaz for what they really are,what we really are
The dips we really are, let it rain

[Chorus]

It has been long fights like this
Long days ,long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain. Nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking,still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go ahead nigga leap feel frogish
These streets I harnish, my peeps my partners
Cam, Jim, Zeek my sponsors, black, griz, snags my monstrous
Paper, drugs, twin my archor. Robs, 40, doe, guard
Bus, train and go hard, let it rain

[Chorus]

This is a story,about a young boy wishin' for glory
Rap, riches and glory. some people I'll love to share it with
Yea my people my thugs I'll share it with.
You can't eat through this love I'm dealing with
You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with
Its real I'm feeling it my niggaz. cats plan on killing it
Rats real I'm realing it all men like fishermen
Say(hey hey hey baby)
Drive sticks while sticking em, young chicks I'm dicking 'em
All down and yea they all down
But why it got to be like this, why every girl I meet got to be like this
Let it rain

Wishing it would rain
I'm just sitting here waiting for the rain

Juelz Santana,"My name mean a lot to me, pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing, but the game means a lot to me
I slang caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III, and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimey as I could be, as sheiesty as I could be
Niggaz who live nicely, who don't understand the life of me
Other niggaz don't like me, and wanna take my life from me
They don't understand that I love it, and I like the beef
The raw, the guns, the violence, it's all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously, waiting for you to get out the driver's seat
I don't think like usual people
Who think like usual people, who don't think right
I think like Muslims, in movements of people, who move they people
And move on your people, power is stronger than voo doo and evil
I'm immune, I drunk the juice, took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out, why I do, the crimes I do
With the minds IQ, of an Einstein too
Tell 'em, Cha-cha, and bon, bon goo, they think I'm crazy, well I do too
Leave me alone please, I'm in my two-three zone please
Nothing can stop me, you fuckers can't stop me

[""Why"" continues to play]

[Verse 2]
It's like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter, I keep burning it down
I smoke so much, I could nurture a pound
My thoughts are always foggy, they blurring right now listen
I see the game for what it's worth, pain, fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you're fucker, they thinking
Of ways to get even, or a way out the hood, they make up a reason
For the judge, for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpena, that'll change your demeanor
So be careful, where you skating through this game
Remember it's other niggaz playing, skating in your lane
Don't get clipped, or stripped skating in the rain
Cause niggaz will keep rolling, and skating on your brain
That's just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you, you playing, and you paying like you weigh in, so..
If not, those wolves aiming where you layin'
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
That's why I walk with that thing out, when I'm pasting
Cause I know these niggaz hate it, that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it, plus I'm frontin
Twenty three big truckin, new Z, new bucket

I gotta be there, I ain't get to see my daddy around,
We ain't never get to ball out kid,
I was young, the game caught him before I did, but
Back to you son, as for you son,
I'd do any and everything, that's the truth son,
From the dirtiest diaper, till you get old enough to dirty your nikes up,
I'm your clean up man,
You ever need a hand, need a foot, need a heart, need a lung,
Reach for the phone, call me up son,
Yes, everything drops for you, everything stops for you,
I'll bury a block for you,
I'll let go every shot for you, and I'll reload the clip, just to make sho he's hit

I gotta little boy to look after,
I gotta little boy to look after,
Said I gotta little boy to look after,
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard 

Everyday I look in your face, I sit back and I smile,
Look at his face, its just like mine, wow,
Damn, this kid shines,
Authority and prioritys, this kids mine, so,
That means I gotta beat him if I have to,
Keep him out of bad schools, teach him how to rap smooth,
Show him the ropes like, make sure his rope's tight,
No screws loose, no loose screws,
Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect,
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left,
You ever get craze for candy, don't take a strangers candy,
Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candys,
I'm your rider, your guider, pusher, provider,
But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you,
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you,
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom,
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

[Chorus]

I raise you up in the sky, like behold,
The only thing greater then I, YOU, my greatest achievement,
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it,
Without you I can't make or succeed shit,
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit,
You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,
You lace em up tight, you fall, get up fight,
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights,
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours,
So you just keep handling yours.

Remember Santana was next
Now its not techs, its checks and fancy collects
I want his wrist, fist, whole had, jammed with baguettes
Pose for the camera man me and Santana man

Word to my grand ma he one bad mamma jamma, damn
So I don't write for the stardom
I get, booted, zooted, write down my problems
I've been through it headed right for the bottom
D.C. naw, would've been a sniper in Harlem (so what)

That's why I throw some doe to my cody from Kosovo
Help me get on overflow (shhh) no one suppose to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister
Thousand grams of dope smellin' like Hine Vinegar
That was a lot to linger, but to the top I bring her

But when it came to dope, I always copped in fingers
Money missin', oh shit I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrist, that's when they said oh shit he's not a singer
Fuck the rap, fuck the movies, fuck Siskel and Ebert
This pistol I'll squeeze it, missiles if needed (killa)

Remember I'm gonna spend my cake
Remember Jim we getting out of five eights (projects)
Now chefs will fry us steaks (that's true) it's a higher stake
Swiss accounts I'm goin' show you how to wire cake
And we from BBQ, now you a CEO, direct a video 

Your own album here we go
That's my man anytime I holla, holla with me
We shared chicken sandwiches they was a $1.50
But you seven dollars, nickel bag and white owl
I hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night child

We ain't care we didn't sleep we was night owls
Insomniacs our life styles compatible
Magical pops gone, shit tragical
Mom's on mission, my house is where the attics chill
I'm like a teacher, I need me a sabbatical

Its not irrational, I grew up radical
And you all are shook, I bought all my crooks
Fuck you R&B niggas Zeek sing all the hooks

You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

Now he headed towards shorty block, forty cocked
On his zip, on his shit, like he don't care who shorty wit
But somebody saw him, before he go to shorty
Shorty phone ring, somebody called him
Somebody warned him, he's comin he's comin
Shorty replied, somebody stall him
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in to old timers ear, death is soon to come

[Chorus]
They say hell is hot,but is heaven cold
Know one ever knows til you Gone, gone, gone

And when you gone does ya soul drift off to a better place
Or do you jus float up and fade
Away,away,away,away, like a bird when its headed towards the sky (huh, huh)
Or do you just die (huh huh)
Or do you just perish from the earth and its over

[Juelz]
Baddest bitch up on the block
Prolly make a nigga cum when as soon as she get up on the cock
She fuck wit Tony don't she (don't she)
Oh he's, not ya average drug dealer, fa sho he's
Bien watched by police, feds
Investigators, oh, can't forget the haters
Home girl ain't got a clue what he do for a livin
She jus think she got a dude wit a pension
She don't know dis dude is a henchman
And he move on dudes wit the cruelest intensions
All she know she got a brand new benz
And its big enough for her and all her brand new friends (Damn)
There she go, all through the street wit it
Dude in and outta towen, she all through the street wit it
We all know the street talk, we all know the street missin
Next thing she's missin....(music stops, phone rings twice)
""Hello"", ""Ay nigga I got yo bitch, have a million sent up or she dead""
Damn,she in deep shit, and she did nothin
I betchu she ain't see dis comin, but he did
Cause he did nothin, he ain't pay (pay)
He told 'em keep dat bitch, he okay
He got a wife and a kid, back home
And he don't care about the life that she live (Damn)
Now that's wrong (wrong)
But the story ain't over it drags on (aw man what happened next)
They wind up beating her down
Breathless, he winds up fleein the town (til the next bitch)

Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)

I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?

With my, real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)

Well that's what the fuck they gon need
'Cause I'mma bury these niggas this time around

Who better than me, you better than me
Shit you never will see if you dead and deceased
Keep two', lead, and the piece and I'm busting it off right
Leave a trail of smoke like a fucking exhaust pipe
Took the coke up out the stash cause they know about the stash
Now I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, yeah sown up in the bags 
I do my chicks like Ludacris blow it out your ass
I'm a mean pimp you know what I mean pimp
Four hoes on each strip all bringing me chips
Futuristic, so when I'm gon they gon have to do ballistics 
Just to prove I'm this sick
You niggas need to be spank by your mami
For ever thinking you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short late waist pack money 
I get that all straight a.s.a.p. money bring it here now!

[Chorus: x2]
Touch the coke, touch the pot, add the soda what you got me!
I am what I am I be what I be and that you will see I am crack!!

Who want it with I you want it with I 
I'll shoot one of ya eyes
You'll lose one of ya eyes
I'll jam move and slump ya
Leave your body in ranch cuckamonga with ants moving under
My flows so in order I can turn soap and water to ocean water and float the border
You never will be what I forever will be 
Your tombstone never will read we buried a G nope!!
I'm so mean and nice with the things I write 
Jesus might say Jesus Christ
It's only rap so why y'all trying to hold me back
Like y'all ain't ask for to owe me back I'm here!
My peoples play and sling cocaine
More than Billy Blanco from Carlito's Way
So you can find me on the streets okay 
With that big fucking piece okay

[Chorus: x2]

Too dope for this but you won't admit 
So my two's smoking spit make you choke on spit
You ever seen a man gag and gargle
Sound like a new born trying to ask for bottles 
They like cut it out you slacking
But I bust it out in rapping 
Can you name a nigga better without me busting out in laughing?
Nigga you couldn't spit enough to get at me 
I'll stretch ya for extracurricular activity
I'm more macing than grace is when I say shit
You should say amen after my name kid
Yes this is that of greatest
You should say amen after this statement

I mean, you mutha fuckas don't realize, how real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family, protect what's right
Ya Dig! 

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much he pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause' he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause' sister was sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'cause' he was good at handlin coke and Jose liked that
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there n hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up n spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came frome
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
So they let him go thinkin he would tell them where Jose kept the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
And he said there's no way out that
He said shoot em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And next minute someone blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on old man's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no mans great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
And he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

[Outro]
The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes
You surprised? Don't be man, It's just real shit
Holla at ya boy dipset, AYE!",Lil' Boy Fresh
Juelz Santana,"[Chorus]
Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back

Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya

Put the coke in the pots whip it over the rocks

How to get that shit how to twist that wrist

And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
I guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one four org

[Chorus]

Copped ten sold five then I hide three
Baking soda residue I'm gone with the other two

HOW vivid this picture it
ME gifted and living this
NO gimmicks or images
I spit and deliver it
LIKE no one that's living shit (AYE)
Straight from the ground y'all you dig?
Close to where the groundhogs live
Where the police hound y'all kids
Arrest and give out long bids
From where they keep the four squeeze the four
Hustle all day in the streets so long
If the feds ever decide to come
We all going down for the motherfucking reaper law

[CHORUS]
I was taught be smart stay humble
I was taught be hard don't fumble

Rumble young man rumble

I was taught in these concrete jungle
Rumble young man rumble

Greater than great I am
YES haters they hate I am
WHAT playing I play to win
PLUS still I remain up in
THE hood I came up in
BUT the hood I came up in
FUCKED since Bush done came up in YUP (AYE)
From my date of birth hun'
'Til my day in the dirt come
I remain the earth's one
YES the matrix's first son
Toast to the good day to the bad day
To the good yay' to the bad yay' 
To the time the shit was mixed up
I had good yay' on a bad day

[Chorus]

HOW by any means necessary
I'm here to promise to keep my vows in order
I'm here to promise to keep my child in order
'Til the day I get locked
'Til the day I get shot
Or till the day I just drown in water (AYE)

And let niggaz know that I died with a heart of a G (AYE)

Man, first I just wanna salute my soldiers
Knahmean? We just trying to stay above water
Feel me? I mean I speak for the Gs, the hustlers
They understand me, knahmsayin?
Shit
Lock into this time and lock out (always)
I mean ain't nothing promised to niggaz like us
You know?

[Juelz Santana]
Just a, another day another dollar
Now look what you got
Another hater, another plotter
Shit, you know the drill
A brother pay, a brother holla
Watch 'em, they creeping
Another raid, another copper
Aw man
Another case, another lock-up
What
Another bail, know that cake better pop up
Yup
That's just day to day shit we go through
And results of the day to day shits we go through
Some niggaz day to day pitch, they local, and
Some niggaz day to day bricks, they coastal, and
Some niggaz day to day snitch, they vocal
I don't honor them fools
Them type of dudes get they tonsils removed
I speak from the heart of the hood
From the boarded up apartments with wood
From the cracked down crack houses (yeah)
To the burnt up black houses
To fiends inside with that burnt up glass out
And puffing weed makes my actions switch
I'm at the window, with the pistol, like Malcolm
Ain't that a bitch (man)
And I'm paranoid, paranoid
But still I got to get it, got to have it, make it happen boy

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take
And may this song play all the way
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me

[Juelz Santana]
Look now
Another dead, another born
Vice versa
Another here, another gone
Pay attention
Another smile, another mourn
Another funeral, another baby shower going on
Get it, huh
That's just life in the hood
You earn scars, you earn stripes in the hood
Huh, get it
I live the life of a hustler
No sleep all night for a hustler, buster
And if your coke weak, cut it with Bo Peep sheep
I swear fiends will chase that high for four weeks
I'm still dealing with the day to day beef and
Stress, hunger, patience
The day to day basics
Yep, shit that we go through, you know
Shit
Look at the shit that we go through, you know
Niggaz come home, can't get jobs
Niggaz getting money, acting like they can't get robbed

Get your knife, time to gut a motherfucker Ay
They hand you the snub
Dismantle your mug
A head shot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs
The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

[Chorus]

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (Ay)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (Ay)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (Ay)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (Ay)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (Ay)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (Ay)

[Chorus]

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S.
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack
Come see me, little nigga, I'll give you a gat like
Here, here's a hammer nigga
Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga
Here, go murk a nigga",Violence

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

I sends the battle scene to the apocalypse

Be gettin sorta puckery
Gettin the Brewin gassed to save that ass come stop the fuckery
My style'll leave ya posin like a hitch hiker
Make me want to bitch microphone slap that shady ass, you bullshit nigga
Your frontin said you didn't think too hot of me
But once you feel the vocal sodomy you'll say, ""You got it, G""
I finds the virgin ears I'm bustin raw pops
Ya savin the drops, tryin to analyze my DNA, the verbal blueprint
Even if you spend eternity you're baffled, nigga
Havin not the slightest clue of how I'm swingin
Bringin styles and flow that's nastier than urine
See my shit is pure and ghetto embellished demonic funk and all that good shit
A bad nigga when it comes to grabbin mics
I love all women of the spectrum, fuck around I'm stabbin dykes
And as I hurt em I convert em, when it comes to honey dip skits 
I'm leavin pussies sore as if you just delivered triplets, I flip shit 
When niggas say the brewin doesn't rhyme slick 
I yokes em in the Heimlich just to get the fuckin garbage out ya throat

Look under ""fat"" and you'll see my profile so smile 
You're grinnin like the Joker
Cause I chose to smoke a mic and let you witness 
Get this through your thick skull: my shit is deadly 
I kicks my verse, niggas couldn't offer competition with a medley of their works
I smirks when booty niggas try and grab this 
Survival of the fittest call me fuckin Tony Atlas, at the podium 
I pours my sodium in open flesh wounds as I mesh tunes with the vocal joint 
To become the focal point
Brothas of funk soon discover I be +deeper+ than that nigga Larry Fishburne's +cover+
Hover on the L, sorta like a stealth in the night
Then I makes the party +jump+ even when it's full of +white men+

Hintin to rewards of the lord's charity received with clarity

I comes to spark a teck
Mind barrages massages carressed in peace 
The vocal acupuncture your stress released 
Like a hymen crack in my rhymin slack and never that 
Styles mysterious like under LL's hat

The curious become the furious and play the jury
Thus I'm found guilty labelin my sound filthy with the gutter in my utter 
A fat bitch goes, ""Me me me"" 
I cut her in pieces kill her sisters daughters and nieces 
Anything related to such a thought

What y'all know about them wild niggas
Devil child niggas
Have-you-kick-the-bucket-say-fuck-it-and-smile-niggas
The type to catch the Buddha buzz, slide up to the fuzz
Sayin ""Officer, run your shotty before I catch this body""
I knew this nigga Smokey, sorta like his pistol
Barrel when you're in peril and shit like that was wanted
But later that would die down,
Sorta like many abandoned that he ran with
His block felt sorta haunted
His only solitude was wifey, word to life, G it seemed
They was together forever and now the womb had been seeded
He needed a job and the robbin wouldn't do it
He wasn't tryin to go out like Diquan in Strapped
Her mother was a nurse, her purse was chubby
From the hospital she found Smokey some work and shit was lovely
With some cream in here, feed a patient there, he had loot
And not a nigga on the street would have to get that pocket tapped
He's workin in maternity and learnin
Seein much about the infant children
To be skilled in fatherhood
Stealin baby stuff home for self
And he didn't have to pull the Mac-20 off the shelf and get...

Chorus:
Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....

In Maternity, Smokey saw stuff, raw stuff,
Make-you-drop-your-jaw-stuff, hospitals get sorta wild
He saw some babies shakin, awakin if they were fortunate
His soul was scorchin, it would have thinkin of his child
Later there would be no ""Honey, I'm home,""
Strictly ""Woman if you jeopardize my seed, dead up, I leave you wet up""
On the block, a flock of zombies entranced
By the peddlers of temporary ghetto heaven had him fed up
His job was gettin hard to fuck with
They had even had him stuck with the disposal of the stillborn
Poisoned by the nourishment, the ill torn soul from flesh
From the womb to tomb
Seein shit like that'll have you crazy
That night he had a dream
And it was a child nursin upon the semen of the glass genetalia
Clouded nut after clouded nut
He woke and shouted ""What the FUCK is goin on?""
Smokey was swayze, it's time to get....

Chorus

[Brewin]
He figured there was only one way
As he rushed the runway lookin wild deranged
This was common, without any qualm inside he was tookin
Lookin at fiends of the pebble adored praised,
Devil for lord raised from the crystallized tombs
Through fumes from the floor
Blazed the sole sacrificial altar

Juggaknots,"I declare war 
The joy becomes a rappifyin' weapon 
If you step in 
When your draws get mobbed behind enemy lines
You become a sittin' duck but fuck 
I ain't givin' 'em livin' trifle 
The pen and pad becomes a 12 gauge rifle 
This is no laughing matter 
Step into this you step in a minefield 
Your body's scattered 
You people drop pickin' up the pieces 
But only corny niggas 
The attack from a brotha like the Buddy never ceases 
Without a moment of silence the violence thickens
So if you ain't got it together you slim pickings 
Shorts and prisoners are never taken 
If you fakin' all the booty competition 
I'm a bag fuck a white flag 
Get down and dirty like a brotha in the trench 
Leave a nigga dead and stinkin' as he wonders what his stench is 
I'm bustin' clip after clip 
My artillery will funk on the punk 
When ya want to test my shit

Tell it to hell is it
I feel my brain swell like meningitis 
With the slightest mind motion 
Givin' me the notion
That I got it bad 
I think I got a brain tumor 
Brain rumor 
Such a pain to analyze the strain and then understand it
The seed was planted
That shit is ill but still 
The thought I'm lovin' got the dome growin' 
With the biscuit in the oven 
Shovin' nothin' but the nutrients 
My diet to support me
A whiff of the spliff 
A guzzle of the forty to inspire fire thought
To the mic there was marriage
Causin' competition 
Verbal miscarriage of the mental fetus 
Greet us with the rugged rhythm then I'm showin'
I think I feel my water breakin' thus I'm flowin'
Timin' my contractions 
Concentratin' on my breathin'
Heavin' curses at the father he has the funk 
'Cause if I flunk my shit ain't livin'
Pushin' givin' every bit of what I'm worth 
And as the Brewin' drops the lyrical 
The miracle of birth

I be the sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga 
A phony motherfucker grave digga 
I know this sounds rough 
But I had enough to funk 
So part of me the heart of me
So if you corny nigga 
It's like cloggin' up my artery 
You cuttin' circulation 
So now it's do or die 
While niggas always try to test my shit
Only preservation of the funk is why I kick this
As I give a simple diagnosis of the sickness

Now upon the fruits of my labor 
Your ear feasts 
The beast from within 
It's some shit ain't it
The picture painted 
From the use of a noun and a verb might disturb 
We make you say, ""Damn that nigga's crazy"" 
Well if we crazed, deranged well then we fittin'
If you say the world's a normal place
Who the fuck you kiddin'?
Your mind's blind if you say you haven't seen this

And lips are made to kiss
To see somebody in the moonlight
And hear the song I miss

She needs to feel that she is free

To know I've got a lot
She's a dove caught in flight

Without a landing place in sight

She'll find a place before she sinks
She's off alone, on her own
Leaving me to sit beside the telephone

Yesterday we walked hand in hand
You were with me, you were my own
You were my girl, you were the lover of my life

That I did not miss the boat

So life goes on day by day
All that's left for me is hit my knees and pray
Cast away loose the knot

Like lashes from the hand of time 
I've never had these feelings before 
But I know that inside I'm dying 

Falling deeper in a pit of emotions 
Not sure of what I should do 
Feeling trapped by my indecision 
With the anticipation of being alone 

I look inside but i'm afraid of 
What I see when I look in your eyes 
I get scared they might look at me 
I stare with a sullen glaze 

From infinity to eternity 
I stare in your eyes they're black 
So black but never look back at me 
I don't want you anymore 

But that's what makes me want you more

The raw guilt and directed blame 
Retaliate for the things that upset me 

But my conscience won't let me 
The more I know the more I don't want to know 
Questions in my head about the way you feel 
Tie knots in the fabric of my mind 

I want to get away from you but... 
I can't get enough of you 
I was alone 
But I was happy 

I let you in and you tricked me 
There's nothing I can do for

Come together and

Mä silmäni suljin ja sinut näin tytössä naapurin

Olin nuori ja keuhkoissa kirveli Boston

Sä olit mun nainen, nainen Marilyn

Mä tuijottelin silloin vain sinun herkkupoveen
Ja kuuta ulvoin illoin - langenneena loveen

Marilyn, Marilyn, tuon ajan saanko koskaan takaisin

Mä tulisesti sua kirjeillä lemmin
Vaikka MGM vastaili virallisemmin
Mua mitkään voimat silloin masentaneet ei

Mä rahani tuhlasin sun joka leffaan
Ja unessa hampaat iskin sun peffaan
Oli kaikkein pyhin sinun hurlumhei

Ja kun sun nurinniskoin sai kirjailija Arttu
Mä seinältä sun kiskoin, sä olit pelkkä narttu

Ja siitä Hollywoodiin aatosten siivin

Juice Leskinen,"Silmissäni orpo katse lapsen eksyneen
Rakkautesi jäljet vihloo rintaa
Käy pimeys päälle lailla pommikonelaivueen
Ja minä kun en koskaan kysy hintaa.

Viidestoista yö taas saapuu painajaisineen
Ja kaikki, paitsi elämä, on turhaa
Aina oikein uskoa ei jaksa ihmiseen
Kun ihmiskunta tekee itsemurhaa.

Sun kanssas katson maailmaa
Ja samaa unta nään
Kuin hullu huudan rakkauteni perään!
Sun kainaloosi käperryn
Ja jos sallit yöksi jään
Ja kun aamu on, en tiedä missä herään.

Käy tuuli läpi pääni, etelästä pohjoiseen
Oon yksin ajatusten raunioilla
Ikuisesti kolisevat sanat tyhjyyteen
On jälleen tuskan viitta hartioilla.

Viidestoista yö, se saapuu aina uudelleen
Taas huomaan kahden viikon unohtuneen
Jäi iholleni hiekkaa rannan autioituneen
Voi olla että vihdoin pääsen uneen.

Good luck cuttin' nothin', carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I play along when I hear that favorite song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better know when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like magic's solely yours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays

You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in bed till dawn with you, you, you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clapped your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young boy I found

I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love

Could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet

Whose name you forget.

The light is brief,
Don't waste it.

Maybe were just shooting stars
Needing something to hold on to,
But each thing we touch seems to vanish, 
Like candles and friends
They burn at both ends.

And as I brushed my hair
I winked and said, ""you might"".

With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain't finished college, she a head doctor

As propellers on a helicopter

Back to my suite, ten grand a night
Just me and you, it's a private party
She's sent from heaven, mayne
She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick
I wonder how she fit jeans on it
For me she unleash her inner animal when we meet
And she a lady off in the streets
But a beast when we in the sheets

When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead",The Woods
Juicy J,"Hey, I'mma visit the sky today
Hey, I'mma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

I'm tryna sink in some gin
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hating on me, on me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doing something right
And if their mamas know my name, and if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
Just cos she loves me, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, she can't feel her knees
And I'm not tryna talk
And I'm not tryna walk
Just lift me out the club

One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
Weed blowing, champagne poppin
Got that drink flowing, champagne poppin

Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For ‘bout a week, shootin’ a shower scene
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rollin' blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new skywalker, I’ll put your ho in a body auction
When I’m having fun, I’m still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my twelve gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mill
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like popping pills
Keep a double cup, I like cracking seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, bout to drink up
If you're talking about money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend coming home with me
And when she alone with me
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'mma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
'Cause their pussy is the best and they head fire

One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights
One of those, it's gonna be one of those nights

Jukebox the Ghost,"There's a dead man hanging, slumped over the steering wheel of an interstate
Runaway bursting into flames
And the devil was gently breathing, sleeping face-down in my
Apartment, and like all his friends I'm growing tired of his games...

And there's a homeless man arranging his hands, grooving to the beat
Radiating from a police scanner, who said ""The air was feeling good to
Me, just as cool and ripe as air can be,"" and a woman who sincerely
Believes in UFOs and who can blame her when the stars are hanging
Overhead, dangling by a thread, floating ten thousand feet off the ground...

(This was a story told to me when I was just the age of 17, one which
God himself dictated to me, he said, ""This is how all this shits gonna
Be when I blow your little planet into smithereens."" It haunted my
Dreams like an accident on reply on a TV screen.)

She sees faces in her dreams--strange machines she'd never seen
Blueprints of submarines to reassemble in a time of dire need
And there were preachers in the desert, waving to the crowd
Dictating seven angry letters from a man up in the clouds

And there were 27 soldiers telling 27 lies
And a hole inside a hurricane with a pair of beady eyes
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

There were strangers in the subway and men in limousines making deals and
Swapping photographs of cans of gasoline, and there are no angels in the woodwork
Or devils on the ground, and they are looking through a hurricane's tectonic wall of
Sound and a man who smokes his cigarettes the other way around and she is looking
In behind him from inside a wall of sound and she is dancing with the neon because
The air is feeling good against her arms and legs and fingertips are measuring the
Distance in the spaces in between me and you and all your friends when there's no
Time to load a weapon and no time to make amends and people frozen in their tracks
Staring at the sky at a hole inside a hurricane revealing...

A pair of beady eyes!
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

This is not a test, this is the real thing...
This is not a test, this is the real thing...

But she can't recall his face
She hears knocking on her door at night
But he never leaves a trace
She's had seven thousand nights with the very same scene
Repeated again and again in her dreams:

A muffled scream, and a broken fall as the moonlight streams in from down the
End of the hall, it's just the stars stooping down to sing their goodbyes while a
Man with a briefcase and hollowed out eyes spoke...

I couldn't tell if you were a bitch or totally bitchin'

Victoria has been crying, I can see it in her eyes
And a part of me is sad, but a part of me is having such a good time
I know that likely I am at fault
Oh but what the hell, I can't even tell if she's putting me on.

You are certainly my poison of choice,
And I know you've had your fair share of boys
But you are certainly my poison of choice
And when I drink you down,
My heart makes a sound like...This!

Es tanzen Schatten an der Wand

Er redet unermüdlich auf mich ein

Als kleines Kind begriff ich nicht was meine Träume mir versprachen

Do you remember our picnic lunch?
We both went up to the lake
And then we walked among the pines
The birds sang out a song for us
We had a fire when we came back
And your smile was beautiful
You touched my cheek and you kissed me
At night we went for a stroll
The wind blew our hair
The fire made us warm
The wind blew the waves
Out on the lake
We heard the owl in a nearby tree.

As bells sounded
In the night.

Then your smile died
On the water
It was only a reflection
Dying with the swan.

Jules Ellison,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Juli,"Die Stadt ist leer, die Häuser sind Waisen. 
Unbewohnt - Die Menschen auf Reisen.
Der Wind streift durch die Straßen und fegt die Gassen.
Und die Wachposten haben Wache und Posten verlassen.
Und die Wörter mit denen sie Autos verkaufen.
Wie Liebe, Herz und Glück, die holen wir uns zurück.
Denn selbst Gott ist im Urlaub 
und wir fahren Rollschuh auf der Autobahn. Denn

Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.

Die Bank ist leer, das Erbe verbrannt
Keine Sicherheit mehr, kein Geld, keine Angst.
An diesem Ort, an den alle ziehen
Fall ich rückwärts den Himmel hinauf.
Die Welt ist von oben so schön.

Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love.
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in Love
Alle sind in Paris, nur ich bin in love.

Eine gestohlene Stunde. Noch nicht schlafen, noch nicht wach.

Und auf den Straßenlampen sitzen Vögel
Und sie rufen: eine Stunde eine blaue Stunde.

The news just filtered through
There's a new girl hanging out with you
I'd kill the messenger
But she's my friend and I love her
And I know she tells me this for my own good
'Cause she knows I've not moved on
Like a wise girl should

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair
It's more than I can bear

I do the best I can
To go along with God's good plan
He thinks it's obvious
There's no hope for the two of us
So I know he's doing this for my own good
'Cause she knows I've not moved on
Like a wise girl should

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair
It's more than I can bear

Some may say life is for living
But this takes some forgiving
And I will try to

Now she's curled up in my chair

Drive me to the mountains
Take me to the sea
You be strong and beautiful
And I'll try not to be me
With my complications
With my don'ts and dos
You be kind and wonderful
And I'll be good to you

If you feel brave and you ask me I'll say
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Safe beneath these clean white sheets I dream
I'm under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my dreaming

Kiss me in the morning
Hold me though the night
Whisper that it's okay
And I'll believe you're right
Steer me from the shadows
Lead me to the light
Push your hand in my hand
And I won't put up a fight

We make plans but then love demands a leap of faith
So hold me close and never never let me go
'Cause even though we think we know which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

And stay there ?til the baby's born?

My rose tinted glasses are incredible
Blinding me to the inevitable
Coloring my judgment like a jumbo pack of pens
Like the ones you buy for birthday's
For children of your friends

My inner guide was screaming look out beware
I silenced Miss Righteous with one stony glare
Figuring what would she know anyway
Yet thanks to her I'm standing her
Defiantly today

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

My white flag was flying in the wind
Though you had no heard for surrendering
On we marched regardless for reason's still unknown
Sometimes the wrong thing
Seems so much better than being alone

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

Is this a good time to mention
Some where contemplating
An earthly intervention
We're all blessed with 20/20 hindsight

Seems no matter how I try
My Jacob's ladder in the sky
Has all the fallen angels climbing down

Cross my heart and hope to live
Number one on my wish list
If the angels get here they'll come round

To stop me pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

I would hand over my soul
I'd relinquish all control
To any of the angels climbing down

Not fourteen more years of this
Stranded in the wilderness
If the angels get here send them round

To stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

It's not like I've stolen someone else's blessing
Love's still blind and maybe that's the lesson

Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still

Thanks for being soft and kind
For making me change my mind
About everyone and everything
Boxed in this corner of mine
You walked across my borderline
And reached the girl that used to be me

When I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Avoiding any fire and smoke
Safety first is all she wrote
Barricading up the open doors
Headed for the comfort zone
And settled for a life alone
Looking back locked in the ivory tower

To when I'd jump in
Not wondering if I would sink or swim
When I would dare
To move an inch without a single care

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

Thanks for being sweet and strong
For making me feel I belong
To the land of the living

Like when I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Before I invented

He will step into the dark

I live on the frozen surface of a fireball
Where cities come together to hate each other in the name of sport
America, nothing is ever just anything
I looked up to you, but you thought I would look the other way

And you hear what you want to hear
And they take what they want to take

Don't be sad, won't ever happen like this anymore
So when's it coming, this last new great movement that I can join?
It won't end here, your faith has got to be greater than your fear

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting
You are looking for your own voice but in others
While it hears you, trapped in another dimension

Drop your guard, you don't have to be smart all of the time
I've got a mind full of blanks, I need to go somewhere new fast
And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately
'Cause no one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh, I got music, coming out of my hands and feet and kisses

That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting

While we are waiting
For this apocalypse?
What more is there to do?

It's nice to be important
But so close to being despised
It's more important to be nice

I take you dancing too
I take you out

And I'll give you diamonds
And I'll give you space
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

Oh time is over
Don't you know that
If a time won't
Pause or burn
I'll stay right in my place
Now worry's over!

I hear it in your silence,
When you don't speak
There is a quiet, cryin' rage
Burning inside you, so deep.

I'd give you anything
But I'd give you problems
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

I hear it in your voice
I see it in your lips
There's always a catch
I guess that's alright with me

When no one's around
'Cause the map says you're here
Now I can hear a loneliness
Screaming in my ear.

Oh, time is over

Forget the aftertaste of life gone sour.

Will you finish what you started?
Travel the seas you never parted
Remember things you disregarded
Communicate with the departed
Believe in things you thought weren't founded
Prepare to always be astounded
Or keep your dreams and visions grounded
It took a while but then I found it.

No one inspired you in time
So you left your love behind
In a world that discourage
One who's young and full of courage.
You said you'd start at the bottom
But instead you start at the top

On your lap it just might drop.

It can be lonely too at the top

It's time to find some time to fail at makes you most happy.

Sometimes you concentrate on lovers
To forget everything else
Sometimes you hate each other to forget you hate yourself.

So if you're sideways
And if you wanna go my way
Before a meteor shower
Decides that you should be devoured
Whether you're locked up in the tower
Or if you charge them by the hour
Tell me you'll always be a flower
Forget the aftertaste of life got sour.

Will you finish what you started?
Before you celebrate with a cigarette
Remember things you disregarded
Communicate with the departed
Prepare to always be astounded
Believe in things you thought weren't founded
Don't keep those dreams and visions grounded
It took a while but now I found it.",Long Island Blues

Reynard left and went to Warwickshire, to a mound near a railway line,
With canals and a freezing swamp. He climbs high up above the countryside
And breathes freely. To the south he could see Polesworth, and to the
North he could just make out the ruins of the priory where Joss and I
Played cricket as children. We were only three miles away, probably drinking
Tea and talking,

(Have you heard about the orphan, sitting by the coffin)

At the same time as he was taking the stanley knife out of
The bag. He pushed the point into his stomach,

(His Father's not a sinner no more)

until the light shone right
Through. And then he reached down, and he took the bag.
It's a plastic bag
With plastic handles
And plastic sides
And

This love is really not the love that I had planned

Can't you give back what I gave you
I want my life back, I want you

Please don't call me like you've always done before
As if I need to know am I your basic whore
Just don't tell me that your love is on the line
I'm sure the truth will tell, just give it some more time
I'm sick and tired of playing your little game

I'd like to know if you can finally change
(If you tell me your side I will tell you mine)

Why don't you believe my story
I won't tell you lies
You know it's not my dream
And if I tell you lies
You'll only realize

This isn't working out, I can't go on like this
Can't you save her Lord 'cause I just seem to miss
There's only so much one can do to save a friend
I've given her my all, it's useless to the end
Please don't let her die, my mind just won't accept
She is not the kind of girl that's strong or has respect

Can caress my soul
Confused and forsaken
By what I've been told
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free

To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

I've heard your words
In so many ways
Do I trust myself
Beyond your praise
My heart has been touched
By something said
I want to go with her
I want to be led
I knelt at your side
Did you feel me
I gave you my all
To be nearer to thee

And if I stand here
Will you stand by me

And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...

From the place where it belongs
Caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong

Keep the peace; their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
It's their kind of strength
It's their only defense

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire

And now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines

In times like these concerning
Who decides which bridge is burning
Don't fall for map reading
Just make sure that you're still breathing

After the lines were drawn, the children would
Dream of the pearls and how beautiful they were
Year after year they would dive to the bottom of
The lagoon hoping that the oysters would come back
They risked everything - their homes, families
And meager possessions - to search for the pearls
To make sure they were heavy enough to reach the
Bottom, the children tied stones to their backs
Many of them died; streams of blood and broken
Bodies rose to the surface of the lagoon, and
The lagoon cried

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of strength
Their only defense

Julian Lennon,"When they sell the final weapon, we can all watch it blow
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Gotta keep the people working

In the bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

From the mines of anatolia to the isle of mandalay
Along the coast of sullen africa, they're queuing up to pay
No cause, I don't discriminate, I sell to those who buy
There never was an innocent who didn't want to die
And with demand upon the increase what could keep the cost down
If I keep the people fighting, I can really go to town
No surprise, the cash you borrow, we can close the deal tomorrow
Just swiss francs or dollars won't cause me any borrow, boy

In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

Everybody itching for someone to serve the task
I'll arm the politician for the coup, the crew, the cast,
I have a score of different faces, I can look like a lord
Seen in high places, flying on the concorde

Well you can marvel at precision, you can dial a telephone
Call up color vision from the safety of your home
You can mount the great offensive from a button by the chair
If you arm the right system, you can ionize the air

In a bed of iron, they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed or iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
Like the wind across the frontier or the breaking light of day
I push across the mountains, all around the bay of biscay

Freeze in north america, boil in pakistan
All along the amazon, from the fire to the frying pan

Whether air, sea or battle ground, desert sand or snow
When they sell the final weapon we can all watch it blow

Just take that red nose off your face

Don't you feel disgraced?

You're afraid to admit to being guilty
You're afraid to stare at your face
And you pretend that life is always rosy
Wake up and join the human race

How can you honestly say you love me
When you can't even love yourself?
You think your word is Gospel now

Julian Lennon,"All of my love
All of my time
Drawn like a line to you
But it's never enough
Hold me back, and tell me now
I know it's plain to see

[Chorus]
Maybe I was wrong
To believe it was you
Maybe I was wrong
To believe it was you

I could almost touch the sky
With you, darling, by my side
Close your eyes, and you can find
Silence in this heartless time
I know it's plain to see

[Chorus]

Won't you tell me?
Am I dreaming?
Can't escape this drowning feeling
I know it's plain to see

Maybe I was wrong
To believe it was you

Maybe I was wrong
Maybe I was wrong
Maybe I was wrong
Maybe I was wrong",Maybe I Was Wrong
Julian Lennon,"Because of things remembered
Nothing changes; we simply follow
Rhythms that are distant echoes
Ancestors turning in their sleep
Silhouetted on the future
Playful figures that cut across the winking eye
Of God's projector
A partial eclipse of the original light
That eminates in all directions
So the darkness isn't pierced, but rather
Forced to retreat
Pushed out by its own internal explosion
The screen of God's movie is time expanding
And every atom is a solid globular mirror
In which His grotesque anamorphic grin
Splits the darkness!

[Chorus]
Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control

Looking to the future
Is looking at the past
In whichever direction you happen to face
You were forward, and I was slipping back
In the time it takes for the light of the stars to stir
The retina, rods and cones
History's in the beholder's eye
Fait accompli
Dans un outre androit
The further away we are, the farther back we see
Unless
We could gaze instantly across the sound
Where, moored like ships, planets anchored
Swing and sway
Golden barges laden down with mists and frozen crystals
Dancing away!

[Chorus x 2]",New Physics Rant
Julian Lennon,"Open the door to me
It's raining outside
Drenched in life's misery tonight
This lonely night
Day for day
With the stars falling at our feet
All the time
We were living down on easy street

[Bridge]
She won't be home tonight
Because our luck has changed
And nothing stays the same

[Chorus]
When the sky falls down
Does it make a sound
On the other side of town?
So we live with less
Love and happiness
On the other side of town

I cry to sleep
Wondering who
Cradles you softly and true
Day for day
With the stars falling at our feet
All the time
We were living down on easy street

[Bridge]

[Chorus]",Other Side of Town
Julian Lennon,"Hate city rivals, first pulse and then freakola
Dreaming of redemption; no end
To the living edit, the sound of amputation
Or the centrifugal pull of an endless bend
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down 
There's a shimmering dog sayin' danger; what's at work here?
The in-growing twitch of faceless laughter
A cause without end to serve forever
The missionary madness of the sacrificial lamb

[Chorus]
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down

On the hero's tomb is written
Not what he was but what he should've been
And nothing you can do will change the circumstances
Just a mild infuriation with statistics of sin

[Chorus]

A circular lie in a calibrated order
Weathering time with salt and water
Tears that you cry are your endeavor
To break into the madness of imaginary lines, until...

You shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot, shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down",Rebel King
Julian Lennon,"Take me home for the ride
I won't be alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't be alone
We won't be alone tonight

I am standing in the shadows of the garden
Confessing to the pale moon above
If I tell you how I feel
You might harden
I'm scared of being lonely
And of dying without love

Take me home for the ride
I won't cry alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't cry alone
We won't cry alone tonight

I need everything I know you could provide me
But every time I love the flower dies
There's a darkness in the air
That seems to guide me
If you want to see the heartache
You can look into my eyes

Take me home for the ride
I won't die alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight

Sometimes our emotions make it hard
For us to see that
At the heart of loving is respect and honesty
And sometimes I'm afraid that I give
Less than I should give
But this time I will hold you
For as long as I live
I won't die alone
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight",Take Me Home
Julian Lennon,"Would you rather the feeling
Of no feeling at all?
A soundless sea that slips toward
The morning shore, where you stand transfixed
Void of emotion, no clue of a notion 
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

[Chorus]
Pushed by my sail
I am moved by the whale
As he floats through life's seas
He seems always at ease
Show me how

Centurions guard the finely-tuned sensors
That tremble at the slightest onset of stirrings
Which switch the dampers to absorb the emotion
And trigger the filter that screens out
Time and passing
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

[Chorus]

What ya gonna do when it hits the fan?
Open your mind; make a brand new plan
Do you realize that it's in your head?
Want to understand but refuse instead
If you take a deep breath and inhale
Maybe you can understand the whale
We either comprehend or we seem to fail

Julian Lennon,"You know that true love's always hard to find
But it seems it's harder when true love divides
I want to believe
That we can move on without the pain
And I want to believe
That we can move on without the blame
We can't somehow,
We tear ourselves apart
And leave a broken heart.

If we believed in love
We wouldn't worry 'bout the problems of tomorrow,
There'd be a strength inside of us
To last the rest of our lives,
We'd never break away, never let go,
We'd never break away, never let go.

I feel that I've been torn apart in two
My empathy walks hand in hand with you
I just want to be free
From all of the guilt I feel inside
I just want to be free,
So I can release my selfish pride.

To dry our crying eyes,

You’re not better than this!

It’s just better that way:
Go on thinking you’re that cool
No one can send us back to school
There’s just one more stupid thing to do 
You’re not better than this 

I gently watch you fall
It feels like 
Destroying something beautiful
I gently watch you fall
It feels like
Destroying something beautiful

You’re not better than this:
And your life is not a big deal
With insomnia nothing is real
When you’re down it doesn’t matter how you feel
You’re not better than this!

It’s just better that way:
And you’re thinking you’re that smart
You figured out my dead spot
You’re so cruel
You’re so beautiful 
You’re not better than this

Do you hear their screams

Julian Lennon,"Here we go again the lonely road
What do I feel but emptiness inside
So shall I give my heart to break again
Can it be real that I have lost a friend
What can I do to heal my heart again
What can I say to hold you once again

Hold on, for love

There is a side of you that I can see
That doesn't belong in life without you next to me
I know you'd like to feel that love again
Cherish the love you had until the end
What can I say to you
What can I say to bring you home again
I'm not the same I need you as a friend

Hold on, for love

Here we go again the lonely road
What do I feel but emptiness inside
So shall I give my heart to break again
Can it be real that I have lost a friend

Julian Lennon,"Hold your heart within your hands
Cope with what your life demands
But leave it all behind
Free yourself from all the lies
Free yourself from what's inside
But leave it all behind
Can't you see we're a part of destiny

We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive will I be strong enough
We all need a helping hand
We all fall but then we stand
And show the strength I see in all of us
Every single day

Feel you hurt and feel your pain
We have lived a life of blame
But leave it all behind
Don't be frightened by your love
Always learn to rise above
But leave it all behind
Can't you see we're a part of destiny

We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive will I be strong enough
We all need a helping hand 
We all fall but then we stand
And show the strength I see in all of us
Every single day

Could there be a darker day
Love is lost as we decay
Beg for mercy as we pray forgiveness
Try to see the light ahead
Look around you all is dead
All of us have been misled
Forgive us now

We all want to touch the sky
We all ask the question
How do I survive will I be strong enough
We all need a helping hand 
We all fall but then we stand

What to do, how to move him.
I've been changed, yes really changed.
In these past few days, when I've seen myself,

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.

I'd turn my head. I'd back away.
I wouldn't want to know.
He scares me so.
I want him so.

Wine me up with your nights, watch me coming

They will soon.

Don't you just love the smack of firm government? We all appreciate the invaluable support, order and purpose provided by the military to our constitution. It will soon be time for the military to be our constitution, say some, notably the military.

Julian Lloyd Webber,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory

No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 

I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know  no matter what 

If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say

And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm

A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us

No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is

And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world",Your Song (version from the Luhrmann film Moulin Rouge)

Julian Perretta,"The sun looks hot
And the grass looks green
And her face looks pale
Under my rainbow machine.

So I took a bite
From a honey tree
And the stars turned angry
As they looked down at me.

She said, do you, do want to, want to.
Do you, do you want to, do you do you want to, she said, ride my star, all night.

Where did you come from girl
Are you from some other place
'Cause you're far from heaven,
Even to my level,
And you're starting to make me hate.

Don't let me fade away
I've only got 4 more lives to live
And there's an angel sat with my finger tips
When in all on my body.

Infiltrate but never find
Just fallin' slowly
You left me so damn lonely

Try
Steppin' back to when we rhymed
Maybe recreate the times
You were shy but happy
And we were fine and dandy

Here we are again, oh
But backseat love don't move me
I'm just far too choosy.

Stop, drop, go through, open up the letter
Don't you want to make it any better
Baby don't you ever wonder why
Back up, it's not that I think you're clever
I just know that we could do much better
Baby, don't you ever wonder why
I was never by your side

Sigh, take a deep breath and rewind
Bite your tongue and let it slide
Got to see a doctor
Maybe that will shock ya
Love don't die, no
Especially when it penetrates and leaves you blind
And shaking mad and reckless
Got you feeling breathless

Here we go again
The backseat love don't move me
I'm just way too choosy
I'm just way too choosy

Stop, drop, pull through, open up the letter
Don't you want to make it any better

One little thought to me

Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be

I can't reach out and grab it but that's ok with me
What's that jumping up and down in the middle of the street
It lingers then it melts into the wavy liquid heat
What are all those dizzy circles in the corner of my eye
They laugh and float away as I look into the sky
Can't get my arms around it but that doesn't bother me

I see you in people I don't even know
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you

And who are you to tell the truth and kill my fantasy
Why are all those people always saying things about me
I'm not a loser, I'm just lonely
Yeah I wanna lay down next to you
But I'm not one to complain
Yeah I wanna touch you too

Do me a favor and appease my aching eyes
Won't you please materialize
Play another of your tricks with my sight
Be here in the flesh tonight

What's that pretty little thing crawling up my wrist
Call me crazy, call me a masochist
But I'd rather have you in my mind than completely out of sight
So I'll just go on dreaming for the rest of my life

And I don't need a mirror to see that it's true

Ask me a question then I will mess up, ooh

I'm thinking out the window

Or first steps of a tune?
Beautiful to me
And alien to you

It has got a face only I could love
And I know my place outside the hub

He's someone that you kinda know
He's someone that you'd like to know
You kiss him on the cheek and go
You gotta go and be alone

The lowest low is only a beginning
These are the words many people said to me
But in a crowd you lose humanity
Scared of the future that comes from the past

All I say is all I give back to you
All I think is all I go back to do
All I do is all I can't get to you

What am I? I'm a satellite
I revolve around a bigger body
And when I fall, I just disappear

All I say is all I give back to you
All I think is all I go back to do
All I do is all I can't get to you

You only want to be loved and taken away by someone
So you cry in the dark

And your heart is closing and you don't know how to get off this track
Every day you mime a prayer though your faith is shaken
Your godmother has got nobody because everybody's taken

Juliana Hatfield,"Table for one next to the window where I can see reflections of a table for two
He's breaking the news and I'm watching her come undone
Can you take away the other persons place
I was always late, I guess they got tired of waiting
Table for one down near the back where I can relax with a book in my face
I got what I wanted, my freedom

So I raise this glass to myself and celebrate
Two for one is what they're offering
And when you come don't promise me anything
And still I wait

Where is my desert? I think I've been forgotten
A single rose from a fresh boquet
A stomach pain
And when I go it's all I will take away from this God forsaken place",Table for One [#]

Waiting for something, I don't know what
They don't see me so they're not scared
But they tread lightly everywhere

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Sunset?s pink and orange and lavender and gray
There's a bird on a branch at the top of the tree
We wanted the world to give us a chance
Now we're pushed out to the edges

If we stand still blinded by the lights
Is it murder or suicide?

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Over the sand

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long

I stayed till the last of the bottles was empty
And whizzing by my head
I stayed till there was no more air in the room
And my tears no longer moved you
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long, I stayed too long

Next time maybe I will know how to walk away
With pride and grace and faith in myself
Knowing how the world works and the way that things change

And you lied and you lied and you lied again
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

You're holed up in your country estate surrounded by your sheep
They only love you because yours is the hand that feeds
But there's no stylistic variety

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

When I suffer your neglect it's my responsibility

With your chairs that no one sits on and your starched and ironed sheets
You have no faith in the future, you don't believe
That I still got the holy spirit in me

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

Like the moon and stars lit from within

On and on and on, on and on and on

Do you need a resolution
To understand where the pain is coming from?
Were you accused of things you didn't do?
Or were you standing in the middle of a dream coming true?

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every fire that died goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on and on
On and on and on

Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful, beautiful
Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful on the night we kissed in the stairwell

Before we really knew each other yet
It may not be easy but we need to forget
All the mistakes, disasters and words
That should never have been spoken

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on
Every setting sun goes shining on
On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, shining on and on
",Shining On
Juliana Hatfield,"It's late at night and you need somebody to talk to
But who of all those people that you once knew
And if you called just what would you say
Would you break down straight away

[Chorus]
You're so alone
You're so alone
You want to die and nobody knows

You keep leaving messages that don't say anything
Like, ""Hi, how's it going?"" pretending you're okay
You disguise your fear so you don't scare them away
You don't want to go to sleep because the nightmares keep you awake

Your heart is beating strangely
Nausea and pains throughout your body

[Chorus: x4]

You've told everyone who ever meant anything to you
To please just go away
And now you've got nobody what are you supposed to do
It's getting late and the night is getting darker
And you're fading away

You're fading away

And you're talking to yourself
Is this really happening?
And I'm talking to myself
Is anybody listening?

[Chorus: x2]",So Alone
Juliana Hatfield,"She writes songs at night
After everyone has turned out the lights
Though she's still young
She's had a hard life
And she's not giving up believing in fate
And it makes a person strong being alone for so long

The family home it's like living in a war zone
Holes are punched in walls
But no one seems to care at all

[Chorus]
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
So with patience she waits

No one ever had her back
They only laugh when she cries
But in God's eyes

[Chorus]

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
And with patience she waits

[Chorus]

Beautiful beautiful",Such a Beautiful Girl
Juliana Hatfield,"I broke down on 14th street, I could have been blind
And you could have been anywhere in the world but I saw you in my mind
In flashing colors in the middle of the night
Don't they say that in the darkness everything is black and white

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

I found myself in Brooklyn, it was as real as a dream
Then I went back up to Boston with absolutely nothing but a feeling

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

How I wish I could escape the human things
Don't take me for a woman, I am only the song you sing

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Lonely love, lonely love, lonely love, this lonely love
",This Lonely Love
Juliana Hatfield,"In the arms of another
You always have trouble sleeping
It never feels like heaven
It never seems like a sweet thing
And the night is long
You want to jump into the heart of a song

It only brings you shame dropped and broken

Two names on a screwed up piece of paper
Two smiles on a photograph, two souls living as one,
So easy to tear apart

There's no fool like a young fool
Ain't no school can teach you that cool
Ain't no love like your first love
It's gets you here in your heart

I never thought it could end like this
With my back against the wall, so tall
Make me wish that the first kiss never happened at all
You knew from the start, right here in your heart
That love doesn't last right here in your heart

Forever after is a long long time,
But the happy ones are blind to the kind of deal they sign
When your life is on the line
Now the words have all been said and the tears have all been shed
And the lawyers fly in lazy circles up above your head

But you still got your heart, they can't take you heart
You knew from the start, that love doesn't last
Right here in your heartâ?¦. Come on and lose it againâ?¦.
There's no fool like a young fool
Ain't no school can teach you that kind of cool
Ain't no love like your first love
It's gets you here in your heart

You should have listen, to your heart
You should have listen, to your heart

Juliane Werding,"Sechs Uhr früh
Jetzt sperren sie die Zelle auf
Dann beginnt der vorgeschrieb'ne Tageslauf.
Und für mich fängt ohne dich ein neuer Morgen an
Für uns zwei ist die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
Hier sitz' ich und schreib' an dich den ersten Brief
Mir geht's gut
Ich mach' mir Mut
Denk' positiv.
Und ich sag' mir jeden Tag
Daß uns nichts trennen kann
Scheint uns heut' auch die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
Und jede Nacht komm' ich I'm Traum zu dir und sag':
Ich word' auf dich warten bis zum letzten Tag.
Hier bei uns nimmt alles den gewohnten Lauf
Tom macht jetzt um sieben schon die Kneipe auf.
Manchmal sitz' ich da
Seh' stumm die alten Freunde an
Und sag' mir
Daß ich stark sein muß
Drei Jahre lang.
Glaub' daran - so wie ich - daß uns nichts trennen kann
Scheint uns heut' auch die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
Und jede Nacht komm' ich I'm Traum zu dir und sag':
Ich word' auf dich warten bis zum letzten Tag.
Zehn Uhr nachts
Jetzt verlöscht das Licht bei dir
Do machst deine Augen zu und träumst von mir.
Und für mich fängt ohne dich die große Sehnsucht an
Für uns zwei ist die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
Für uns zwei ist die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
Für uns zwei ist die Ewigkeit drei Jahre lang.
",Drei Jahre Lang
Juliane Werding,"Als sie in den Spiegel sah
Eines Morgens - sonderbar -
Da erkannte sie sich nicht.
Dreißig Jahre I'm Gesicht
Ehrlich
Doch es paßte nicht
Weil ihr Herz erst siebzehn war.
Sie wollte nie ein Nein akzeptier'n
Sie wollte nie die Neugier verlier'n.
Und noch immer sah sie sich I'm Cabrio fahr'n
Mit dem Wind I'm offenen Haar - Sehnsucht ist unheilbar.
Abends fernseh'n
Morgens raus
Nachbarklatsch I'm Treppenhaus
Jede Stunde abgezählt.
Einkaufsfahrt I'm Supermarkt
Kochen
Bügeln - Tag für Tag -
War das wirklich ihre Welt?
Sie wollte nie ein Nein akzeptier'n
...
Als er heimkam
Letzte Nacht
War sein Essen nicht gemacht
Und sie stand nicht an der Tür.
Er hat den leeren Schrank geseh'n
Und ohne wirklich zu versteh'n
Las er diesen Brief von ihr:
Ich werde nie ein Nein akzeptier'n
Ich möchte nie die Neugier verlier'n.
Und noch immer seh ich mich I'm Cabrio fahr'n
Mit dem Wind I'm offenen Haar -
Wart' nicht auf mich
Denn Sehnsucht ist unheilbar -
Wart' nicht auf mich
Denn Sehnsucht ist unheilbar.
",Sehnsucht Ist Unheilbar
Juliane Werding,"Derselbe Blick
Geheimnisvoll wie ihr Lächeln
Vier Jahre später
Doch ich hab' sie sofort erkannt.
Wellen und Palmen
Am Nebentisch trinkt sie Champagner
Ich denk' an damals
Warum zittert meine Hand?
Schon seh' ich wieder in meinem Kopf die alten Bilder
Zerbrochene Ringe
Das ende kam mit ihr -
Und nun treff' ich sie wieder hier.
Sonne auf der Haut und offene Haare
Braungebrannt und niemals lang allein.
Sonne auf der Haut
Doch innendrin ein Herz aus Stein.
Augen hinter Glas
Die nichts verraten.
Hunger
Der von Liebe gar nichts weiß.
Sonne auf der Haut
Jedoch darunter nichts als Eis.
Derselbe Zauber
Mit dem sie unseren Traum zerstörte
Dasselbe Feuer
An dem ich fast gestorben bin.
Musik und Gläser
Am Nebentisch hör' ich sie lachen
Sie kennt mich nicht mehr
Sie hat sich längst getrennt von ihm.
Rauch in den Augen
Ich hab' mich an der Glut verbrannt
Was für ein Schicksal verbindet mich mit ihr?
Warum treff' ich sie wieder hier?
Warum treff' ich sie wieder hier?

Ich wollt frei sein nur für mich

Denn ich will dir dein Glück nicht nehmen,
Man kann doch die Zeit nicht rückwärts drehn,
Darum muß ich gehn aus seinem Leben.


Ich hab ihn leider mal geliebt,
So heiß, so tief,
Und war nicht zu stolz, das auch zu zeigen.
Doch daß er lieber frei sein will,
Verstand ich nie,
So kam das Gefühl in ihm zum Schweigen.


Hey Jude, ich weiß noch gut,
Wie ich heimkam an jenem Abend,
Ich sah nur, dein Mantel hing im Flur,
Hörte Musik und dann eure Stimmen.


Ich hab' getobt, ich hab' gekämpft,
Geweint, gefleht,
Doch da war mein Spiel schon längst verloren.
Ich hab' gedroht, ich mache Ernst,
Es war zu spät,

Julianne Hough,"Ever since I was a little girl you couldn't dare tell me a thing
I was as stubborn as they come, I was such a drama queen
Thought I was right, yeah I could do no wrong

Some could've beens, a few dead ends, some bumps along the way
Some never should've been boyfriends that ended in heartache
But I still try to see the brighter side

What goes up don't always come back down
What goes around don't always come around

I've been down on my knees beggin' the lord
The devil's been knocking at my door
I've been in the dark but I've always found the light
I've been up and down this road before
I keep on coming back for more
And I still haven't figured a damn thing out about life

I've lived and learned and I've been burned but it's all a part of me
I've got bars around my heart, but I still believe
There's someone out there with a key

I still dream and I won't give up the fight
And who knows if I'll ever get it right

I've been down on my knees beggin' the lord
The devil's been knocking at my door
I've been in the dark but I've always found the light
I've been up and down this road before
I keep on coming back for more
And I still haven't figured a damn thing out about life

What goes up don't always come back down
What goes around don't always come around
I'm gonna keep on keeping on

And he said you'd go out Friday night
Well he's a total stranger
But he's tall and he's cute

Now didn't we cover all this ground last week
When the last loser left you alone
Now here we are having the same conversation
And I'm wondering if there's anybody listening

Hello
Are you listening
Have you even heard a single word I've said
Hello
Wake up and smell his cheap cologne
How can I get it through your fairy tale head

It seems like you're always falling for the same guy
You just change the face and the name
But if you're gonna keep fishing in a pool of shallow water
You cant give the fish all the blame

Now this is how it is
I'm your friend and I love you
And I hate to see you hurtin' all the time

Then she went to straight tequila
And before the night was over, oh
Her little secret was between us
But she laughed, I cried
And she said, ""I'll be fine.""

Now she's barely walking and I'm thinking
Wonder how long she's been drinking, like this
She looks me in the eye and says, ""I swear I'm quitting.""
I almost believed it
Then she cried but she lies
Cause that's what she said last Saturday night

Somebody when they tell you
That they don't need help
How am I suppose to reach a soul

You've got to
Help me, help you

Oh, I get home from work
I turn the TV on

Says, ""I can't wake mama up from sleeping.""
Well, I burned that road
Opened up the door, she says,

Drifting toward the heavens floating higher and higher
You better hide your matches boy

Cause I could spark like thin white paper
Wrapped tight 'round some cigarette
And leave nothing but the smell of smoke and the bitter taste of regret
Or I could get hot like them coals that turn the water into steam
And fall down around you like some misty morning
You better hide your matches boy
You better hide your matches boy

Oh, cause I'm bound to lose all I am right here in your arms
And it ain't gonna take much
And it ain't gonna take long
So you best turn your eyes if you're not ready tonight
To watch me burn like this
You better hide your matches

Cause I can't afford to let you go
I'm afraid to draw you near
Cause I could get so lost in you that I might disappear
And the words are on the tip of my tongue
But you won't hear a sound
Cause once that fire gets going there's no way to slow it down

Sometimes you've gotta look inside
And find your own way out
Somewhere you'll find an answer you can use
But if it were me, I'd just be with you

You find it hard to sleep
You fight the dark and try to keep some distant light
To hold it all together
Turning circles on your Ferris wheel
Aren't you tired of climbing that hill?
I could be the rain falling in your desert

Nobody says we've gotta stick around
Sometimes you've gotta look inside
And find your own way out
Somewhere you'll find an answer you can use
But if it were me, I'd just be with you

Oh baby, we could run away
Search the world for a better place
But me, I'll always wanna stay with you

Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips

My guard was never down
I was quick on my feet

And I never would've thought
That I'd ever get caught
With my heart on my sleeve

To rock the night away

Julianne Hough,"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

(I) don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video

Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford

I just can't say

(But I've)

Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand

Were thumpin' away, and I

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Vegetable marrows and the fruit piled high.
Woa, Liza, little London sparrows,
Covent Garden Market where the costers cry.

Cockney feet mark the beat of history.
Every street pins a memory down.
Nothing ever can quite replace
The grace of London Town.

There's a little city flower every spring unfailing
Growing in the crevices by some London railing,
Though it has a Latin name, in town and countryside
We in England call it London Pride.

See the policeman yawning on his lonely beat.
Gay lady, Mayfair in the morning,
Hear your footsteps echo in the empty street.

Early rain and the pavement's glistening.
All Park Lane in a shimmering gown.
Nothing ever could break or harm
The charm of London Town.

In our city darkened now, street and square and crescent,
We can feel our living past in our shadowed present,
Ghosts beside our starlit Thames who lived and loved and died
Keep throughout the ages London Pride.

the shadows away,

I shave from my cuff all the whiskers and fluff
Stick my hat on and toddle up West

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And saunter along like a toff
I walk down the Strand with my gloves on my hand
Then I walk down again with them off
I'm all airs and graces, correct easy paces
Without food so long I've forgot where my face is
I'm Bert, Bert, I haven't a shirt

Call for Champagne, walk out again

My body I plank it
On his front door step with 'The Mail' for a blanket
I'm Bert, Bert, and Rothchild was hurt
He said ' You can't sleep there' I said 'Oh'
He said 'I'm Rothchild sonny!' I said 'That's damn'd funny,

I can't let my man see me in bed with a gee-gee
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow!

Shows that my monocle
Holds up my face, keeps it in place,
Stops it from slipping away.
Cigars, I smoke thousands,
I usually deal in The Strand
But you've got to take care when you're getting them there
Or some idiot might stand on your hand.

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And Buckingham Palace I view.
I stand in the yard while they're changing the guard
And the queen shouts across ""Toodle oo""!

Slaps me on the back and says ""Come and see Mother""

I wanted love and here it was
