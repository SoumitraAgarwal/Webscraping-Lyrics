Hector el Father,"Interrumpido queda el sueño por su despertador  
Agotada por la fiesta de la noche anterior  
Con maquillaje todavía, que la hacia ver mejor  
Pero no le trajo amor, hay que dolor  
 
Tantos fines de semanas sin haber podido hallar  
Entre lluvias y tabernas quien la pueda valorar  
Cada vez que llega el lunes tiene que ir a trabajar  
Sin pareja y sin moral, pues no puede captar  
 
Que un hombre interesado en algo puro en algo serio  
No trae hostigamientos, no viene con misterios  
No busca que se embriague, para invadir su dignidad  
Que un hombre interesado en una buena compañera  
No busca en una noche hacer con ella lo que quiera  
No llega seduciendo con palabrerías que no son verdad  
Cargadas de maldad  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer  
 
Cuando cobra la quincena nunca espera para ir  
A la tienda que le ofrezca lo mejor para vestir  
Deseando ya la noche, bien ansiosa por salir  
Desesperada por sentir, alguien que la haga vivir  
 
Un sin numero de discotecas hay para escoger  
Donde busca por un tipo interesado en su querer  
Y aunque abre el corazón para que uno entre en el  
Solo llegan a su piel, pues necesita saber  
 
Que un hombre interesado en algo puro en algo serio  
No trae hostigamientos, no viene con misterios  
No busca que se embriague, para invadir su dignidad  
Que un hombre interesado en una buena compañera  
No busca en una noche hacer con ella lo que quiera  
No llega seduciendo con palabrerías que no son verdad  
Cargadas de maldad  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer  
 
Y llora, y llora, y llora, por ser mujer  
Y añora a todas horas, poder tener  
Un propósito en la vida  
Con derecho a ser querida  
Alguien que no solo pida  
Y que la sepa querer.",Y Llora
Hector el Father,"Te vi llorar 
(Te vi llorar)
Y se me partió el alma en mil pedazos
No eres la misma mujer(mujer)
Que fuiste alguna vez
Sufres por el
Y sientes pesado el corazón
Yo se que tal vez
El tiempo me dio la razón
Dile
Que el miedo te hace pequeña
Y el dolor se hace gigante
Que ya no ríes ni sueñas
Que ya no eres como antes

Y dile que engañarte no lo hace mas hombre
Cuéntale que ya tu no le perteneces
Ven conmigo no le temas a ese hombre
Déjalo que sabe que no te merece

Y dile que engañarte no lo hace mas hombre
Cuéntale que ya tu no le perteneces

Héctor Lavoe,"Aquí ya tienes el amor que prefieres
Aquí ya tienes el amigo que quieres
Aquí ya tienes tu ilusión
Buen cariño y un sincero amor

Aquí ya tienes la ilusión de tu vida
Busca lo mismo dale tu calor
Esa pasión que yo se que enloquece
Dame amor, dame amor, mucho amor

Encontrarás alegrías
Y tendrás felicidad
También sabras de lo bueno
El tiempo te lo dirá

Yo se que piensas que todo es mentiras
Puras promesas solo falsedad
Borra en tu mente esa tonteria
Y verás que todito es verdad

",Mucho Amor
Héctor Lavoe,"Yo era un muchachito cuando murió mi viejo
Fue tanta la miseria que mi viejita y yo
Comíamos llorando el pan mugriente y duro
Que horas de miseria mi mano mendigó

Mi pobre viejecita lavando ropa ajena
Quebraba su espinazo al pie del tinajon
Por míseras monedas con qué calmar las penas
Las crueles amarguras de nuestra situación

Fui creciendo a la bartola y en mis años juveniles
Agarré por el camino que mejor me pareció
Me codié con milongueras me acodé con copetines
Y el mejor de mis amigos cuando pudo me vendió

Engreído me hice el guapo y me encerraron entre rejas
Y de preso ni un amigo me ha venido a visitar
Sólo el rostro demacrado y adorado de mi vieja
Se aplastó contra las rejas para poderme besar

Por eso compañeros con tantos desengaños
No me convence nadie con frases de amistad
Y hoy vivo con mi madre quiero endulzar sus años
Y quiero hacer dichosa su noble ancianidad

Me siento tan alegre junto, junto a mi madrecita
Que es el mejor cariño que tiene el corazón
Ese si que es un cariño que nadie me lo quita
Cariño que no engaña ni sabe de traición

A usted amigo que es tan joven
Le daré un consejo de oro deje farras y milongas
Que jamás le han de pesar cuide mucho a su viejita
Que la madre es un tesoro un tesoro que al perderlo
Otro igual no encontrará

Y no haga como aquellos que se gastan en placeres
Y se olvidan de la madre ni le importa su dolor
Que la matan a disgusto y recién cuando se muere,
Se arrepienten y le lloran, no comprenden su valor

¡Su valor!",Consejo de Oro
Héctor Lavoe,"Las horas que a tu lado yo pasaba
Eran las horas mas felices de mi vida
Son horas que en mi mente van grabadas
Y son horas que jamás nunca se olvidan

La muerte con su poder podrá alejarnos
Y con ella bajaría yo hasta la tumba
Pero mientras en mi ser
Viva mi alma y mi corazón
Mis ilusiones bella existencia serán tuyas

La muerte con su poder podrá alejarnos
Y con ella bajaría yo hasta la tumba
Pero mientras en mi ser
Viva mi alma y mi corazón
Mis ilusiones bella existencia serán tuyas

Serán tuyas, serán tuyas

Oye mamacita linda
Oye lo que estoy cantando
Te estoy diciendo te quiero te quiero
Mamita tu me estas matando

Si Dios un día cégara
Ay toda fuente de luz
El unicerso se alumbraría
Con esos ojos lindos que tienes tu

Tu nombre sigue viviendo
Y vivirá en mi recuerdo
Me acuerdo que te quería
Me recuerdo que te quiero

Mami, mami espérame en el cielo
Espérame vida mía
Pues si en la tierra sufrimos
En el cielo todito sera alegría

Ay hace tiempo que quería
Cantarte esta inspiración
Nacida del alma linda
Nacida del corazón

Si amar es un pecado
Quiero ser pecador
Si querer es sacrilegio
Pues sacrílego soy yo

Ay mami dime lo que quieres
No te puedo dar mas ná
Si ya tu tienes mi vida
Que más te puedo yo dar

Toma mamacita linda
Mira que te entrego aquí
Mi vida, mi corazón, mi alma
Soy todito para ti, Tití

Mami amor como el que me das
A mi nunca me habian dado
Este amor es tan sincero
Mas de lo que había deseado

Héctor Lavoe,"Seguro firme y decidido
Buscando u na mejor sonoridad
Agrupamos el sabor con el ritmo
Dándole vida a este conjunto musical

Unidos en una sola pieza
Modernos los rumberos nos vamos a tocar
Rechazando a aquel que nos combate
Y respetando a quien no sepa respetar

Pa' Lante alta la frente
De frente vamos a demostrar
Que no nuestro no fue un golpe de suerte
Somos hacha y machete y esta es la verdad

Los martirios de sus penas

Con las maldades que encierra la codicia

Ay que no te quiero más
Por mi madre no te adoro más
Que sola te vo' a dejar

Que nadie mas procura ya leer
Sensacional cuando salió en la madrugada
A medio día ya noticia confirmada
Y en la tarde materia olvidada

Fue titular que alcanzó pagina entera
Por eso ya te conocen donde quiera
Tu nombre ha sido con reporte que guardé
Y en el álbum te olvidó lo pegue

Tu amor es un periódico de ayer
Que nadie mas procura a leer

Y fuimos ambos la noticia propagada
Y en la tarde materia olvidada

Apartate de mi lado

Para que voy a leer la historia de un amor que no ni puedo creer?

Te quise, te tuve, te mantuve, pero ya no te quiero
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
A tu casa yo no voy Polito, va y tumbe la chaveta, la chaveta

En el álbum de mi vida en una pagina escondida ahí te encontré

Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Anda vete de mi vera cosa buena, ya no te quiero ni ver
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Que te pasa estas llorando, tienes alma de papel
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Y como el papel aguanta todo, así mismo te traté
Y para que leer, un periódico de ayer
Analizate tu historia, y así podrás comprender",Periódico de Ayer

Por dejarme ver la libertad
Doy las gracias al amor sincero
Eres la reina del solar

Ay mujer como ha sido mi vida
Ay mujer tanto tiempo soñé con tu amor
Ay mujer mi alma no fue vencida
Mil desengaños del mil tamaños
No lograron vencer mi fe

Coro:
Mujer sincera, por vez primera,
Siento un amor como lo soñé

Quiero sentir la lluvia de tu inmenso cariño
Quiero ser el guardián de tu corazón

Ay amor soñado amor amado
Te quiero mami lo sabes bien

Sin saber has llegado a saciar esta sed
Tu tienes el poder para convencerme

Amor a mi me tienes encadenado
Y quererte a ti es mi único pecado

Si mil desengaños no lograron vencer
Que yo perdiera en ti la fe

Ay amor amor yo lo había deseado
Mamacita rica, yo lo había sonado",Amor Sonado
Héctor Lavoe,"Después que te traté como una reina
Te di mi corazón todo mi anhelo
Y ahora quieres arrastrarme por el suelo
Qué te pasa mujer no te avergüenzas

Nunca tuve ni un centavo y el dinero
Que ganaba trabajando como esclavo
Era tuyo hasta el último centavo
Más sin embargo me pagastes con desprecio

No hay quien te aguante muchacha
No hay quien te aguante
No habrá quien te aguante a ti
Como te aguanté yo

Me saqué la lotería
El día en que tú te fuistes
Ahora me das carcajadas
Si de ti voy a reírme

Hasta aquí te trajo el río
En amor y en conveniencia
Sigue, sigue tu camino
Yo lo que quiero es paciencia

No toditas las mujeres
Óigame señor son malas
Pero la que tú tenías
Es tremenda fuerza e'cara

No hay quien te aguante muchacha
No hay quien te aguante

Búscate a otro que te aguante
Que ese lo voy a dar yo
Porque ya tu me cansastes
Y no te quiero por favor

El que se quede contigo
Se gana la lotería
Yo te boté al zafacón
Y la culpa no fue mía

",No Hay Quien Te Aguante

así de fácil lo he de perder

Que me hace de ansiedad enloquecer
Voy a darle a tu invierno soledad
Una brisa glacial, en cada anochecer

Me iré corriendo de tu frío pasional
Tienes la piel hecha en cristal de hielo
Y me parece que tienes al mirar
Un resplandor sin luz ni fuego

Con la misma ingratitud que tu le das
A ese amor sacrificado en tu querer
De la misma manera que me haces penar
Un día al despertar se que me llamarás
Cuando te vaya mal se que me llamarás

La que el gran Gautier
Llamo la Perla de los Mares

Ay del paraíso es la dulzura
Puerto Rico es sabrosura

Por eso tengo salsa, sabor, y control

Y ven y baila la rica plena

Mamita baila con sabrosura

En mi jibarita encuentro yo
Lo aretes que le faltan a la luna

Oye esa si tiene la masa buena
Mami que la masa dura
Por eso a mi mami la quiero

Masa dura con pan es lo que tú tienes
Masa dura con pan el negro te quiere tú ves

Héctor Lavoe,"Pero tu amor apunto muy alto 
Por eso fue que de mi nada sacó 
Cruzó como flecha errada 
Que fácilmente evitó mi corazón 

Te empeñas ser dueña de todo 
Si tanto quiso abarcar nada apretó
Por que? te complace comentar 
Con tanta seguridad que te escondí la verdad 

Mi amor 
Ignoró mi sencillez 
Frente a la complicación 
De no hallar a quien amar 
Pero tu amor apunto muy alto 
Por eso fue que de mi nada saco 
Paso soñando imposibles 
Que fácilmente evito mi corazón

Hector Martignon,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love

con su corazón de grillo.
Le gusta lo mismo que a mi,
el café y el cigarrillo.

¡Así, como es,
rebelde y angelical!
¡Así, como es,
azúcar, pimienta y sal!

La quiero así,
con su cara de muñeca.
La quiero así,
con su cabecita hueca.
La quiero así,
con sus sueños de papel.
Y aunque siempre esta en la luna,
no la cambio por ninguna,
yo la siento como el sol en la piel.
Soy feliz a mi manera
y me gusta que me quiera,
así como es.

con su mundo diferente.
Qué importa su mundo al revés,
sin que cambie fácilmente.

porque yo la quiero así.

Que hoy necesito el recuerdo matar
Sin un amigo, lejos del pago
Quiero en su pecho mi pena volcar
Beba conmigo y si se empaña
De vez en cuando mi voz al cantar
No es que la llore por que me engaña
Yo sé que un hombre no debe llorar
Si los pastos conversaran

Esa pampa le diría 
De qué modo la quería
Con qué fiebre la adoré
Cuántas veces de rodillas
Tembloroso yo me he hincado
Bajo el árbol deshojado donde un día la besé
Y hoy al verla envilecida
A otros brazos entregada
Fue pa' mí una puñalada

Y de celos me cegué
Y le juro todavía, no consigo comprenderme
Cómo pude contenerme
Y ahí no más no la maté
Tomo y obligo, mándese un trago
De las mujeres mejor no hay que hablar
Todas, amigo, dan muy mal pago

Hoy mi experiencia lo puede afirmar
Siga un consejo, no se enamore
Y si una vuelta le toca hocicar
Fuerza canejo, sufre y no llores
Que un hombre macho no debe llorar
Si los campos conversaran",Tomo Y Obligo
Hector Zazou,"Where have all my friends gone? 
They've all disappeared.
Turned around maybe one day, you're all that was there.
Stood by on believing, stood by on my own.
Always thought I was someone, turned out I was wrong.

Why don't you stay behind?
So blue. Why don't you stop, and look at what's going down.

If I had an old woman she'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone who won't sing with you.
Give all of my mercy, give all of my heart.
Never thought that I'd miss you, that I'd miss you so much.
And you brought me through and you made me feel so blue.

And broken hearts to find another way to shut it all out

Hedley,"She was a bottle blond,
She had her 7's on.

Just a cougar on the prowl.
She was hotter than hell,

Get it off my chest I know it’s been a while
And I could use a little facetime
The face to face kind

Where bright angel feet have trod

And provide a robe and crown

Drag you again into the cold
Time to rise!

Hear the call to arms
Our future's been forged somewhere on the anvils of the gods,
Time for the first strike to land!

Exploiting your weakness
Cast aside your fears, raise your sword!
And laughing sends the demon back into the abyss",Berliner Luft

But now look at where we are

We just don't make sense
We don't work on paper
We're so not right
But that's what makes you mine
That's what makes you mine

You're not a typical kind of beauty
And you're always dressing down to spite
You only go to indie movies
And you hate it when the story turns out right
You make a scene whenever you want to
No surprise when they all stop and stare
You never care what people say about you
All they get is a finger in the air

We just don't make sense
We don't work on paper
We're so not right
But that's what makes you mine
That's what makes you (mine) mine
That's what makes you mine
That's what makes you mine

It all seems so improbable
I never would have thought that you're the one for me
The definition of impossible
And I'm never gonna let you go

We just don't make sense
We don't work on paper
We're so not right
But that's what makes you
We just don't make sense
We don't work on paper

Hefner,"There's no reason to be bored when,
A face like yours is adored by all men.
Your making up for lost time,
And your best ideas were mine.
At the age of twenty-seven,
You realized your bed was empty.
A child is what I need but your face is all I see.
Those bruises don't betray any violence on my part,
You've taken my possessions and your dressing like a tart,
But it's miserable and sluttish to be acting like I do in front of you.
No matter how you try you'll never be as cheap as me,
When people have got no one else they can always sleep with me,
And no one else could be a better friend to you than me.

It's not love it just smells like it,
The scent of summer is so exciting.
No matter how you brush your teeth,
I can still smell the nicotine.
And there's no face I'd rather kiss than,
Your sweet face, oh when it's smiling.
I loved you until you were bedded,
And our parents still talk of a wedding.
Those bruises don't betray any violence on my part,
You've taken my possessions, we're both dressed up like tarts,
But it's miserable and sluttish to be acting like I do in front of you.
No matter how you try you'll never be as cheap as me,
When people have got no one else they can always sleep with me,
And no one else could be a better friend to you than me.",Another Better Friend
Hefner,"I bet your eyes aren't really that blue, I think they've been airbrushed
in by an artist who doesn't care. 
And I bet your hair isn't really that blonde, but isn't it the way we
wanted it to be. 
And I bet you don't usually smile that much, especially with some one like me.

And I bet you really sweat, but none of this is what I want to say to you. 
I don't want to be dancing with the wallflower, I want you cause you've
got painted toenails. 
My tired arms ache just to hold you now. 
I don't believe that you are still a virgin, so what say we get a little
closer. 
Come with me I'll take you on an airplane now, 
And London from above at night will look like a billion lit candles, 
And your face will glow red at the sunrise, 
And god knows I really want to travel and god knows I really want to start anew,
with you, 
And god knows, god knows, god knows.

Hefner,"Make yourself pretty for your boyfriend, Cause his your boyfriend,
Your gorgeous boyfriend.
Hitch up your skirt for your boyfriend, Cause his your boyfriend and no-one else's,
No-ones got the tongue of my sweet girlfriend that moves so swiftly inside my mouth,

And no-ones got the legs of my sweet girlfriend that wrap around me and pull me to her,
It was God who told me to,
God who told me to.
Long nights, short skirts, high heels taunt my eyes,

But I'm alright since god is on my side,
My head falls below her soft white thighs,
But I'm alright since god is on my side.
And could she be the one, to fall for this dirty rotten farmers son,

Oh her ankle chain it teases, makes me feel like I am twenty one,

Just place my weary hands upon her chest.",God Is on My Side
Hefner,"Sobriety breeds sincerity, and Lydia Pond she is my gravity.
I don't know how she felt when she took that E,
But in the morning she shaking, she was twitching, she was jerking.
On June the 5th she moved to Paris, she could not stand the state of British politics,
And I just can't convince her that I'm socialist,
And every night I pray for mail in the morning.
Sweet Lydia Pond is doing it for me,
And I want to sing a hymn for the postal service.
Sinful and proud since I stopped sleeping around,
I am so faithful now to Lydia's handwriting,
That makes me guess the circumstances under which she wrote it,
Why she used the f-word when she never, ever spoke it,
She pasted on a passport photo of herself in pigtails,
And underneath she'd written did my touch make you less lonely.
Oh she promised me that we'd be creasing sheets,
And that our bodies would be bruising, wrestling underneath,
And I wanted to ask her how she cut her teeth,
And why she let time slip through her skinny, skinny fingers.",A Hymn for the Postal Service
Hefner,"He started to woo her in a most peculiar way, 
The Librarian's dress was a fawnish shade of grey, 
The books he was to borrow he would surely never read, 
They were of an intellectual calibre, he hoped that she would see. 
He planned to take her home to bed some day, 
He'd smooth her goosebumped skin whilst she lay, 
But the unspoken truth they both knew, 
Whilst he'd dream of her often she would forget in just ten minutes. 
Her beauty has not truly been seen til her beauty's been seen by his tired
eyes, 
Her tears have not truly been dried til her tears have been dried on his tattered
shirt sleeves. 
Her body has not truly been stripped til her clothes have been ripped by his nail
bitten fingers, 
Her beauty has not truly been seen til her beauty's been seen by his tired
eyes. 
He was beginning to irritate so she made him go away, 
The smallest cruellest insults she ignored his subtle ways. 
The deftly silence let him know his efforts were in vain, 
Did the thoughts ever exist and if so could he find them. 
(and oh, oh the loneliest of nights, he will never hold her tight, he will never
kiss her eyelids.)

Hefner,"Girl, you're a teaser, what an earth did I just do to deserve a thing like you,
And there's love inside the stud farm tonight and while the horses buck and moan I've found a place in you called home.
You don't know what you've done to me,
With that voice, with those eyes,
With that smile, with that smell.
Oh, tonight you're going nowhere you are lying here with me,
Tonight you're skin is warm enough to rid this chill in me,
So open up your eyes, open up your mouth,
Let me kiss your forehead now the night has fallen down.

Nesting by your side, I will sleep with you tonight.)",Love Inside the Stud Farm
Hefner,"It's the children that I feel for, 
Yes the children make me feel more, 
More than the liqour, more than the art, 
More than the Beach Boys records. 
It's the drink that gives us heartache, 
It's the charity we won't take, 
We feel so empty and our late twenties should be better times. 
It's the love and the truth and the hope and the faith, 
That will destroy us in the end. 
It's the look in the eyes of those one night stands that gives us the will to
pretend. 
It's the feeling of fucking the people that we're loving that spurs us
onto endless sleepless nights, 
And love will destroy us in the end. 
There's not a thing that I can save from all those wasted, wasted days, 
And theres no faith that will ever save me from being faithful, 
And the damn phone never rings, 
And I would give up everything, 
For a little wine, some conversation 
And just for being healthy. 
",Love Will Destroy Us in the End
Hefner,"You wouldn't believe in my new belle she flits and weaves a curious spell,
And under my skin there's a place where she resides.
Finding a release in prayers and psalms I will obey her articulate commands,
She is just a coquette and how I wish I could forget.
Breathing new life in to the sad witch and she promised me three wishes and all I wish is she should remain here.
A poisonous saint with a brittle, crippled frame and she fooled me with her motherly gestures, my only guess is she's misguided.
The sins, the sins the heavenly limbs that greet below the red, red lights,
Hold no sway with me now she's my intended.
The jewels around her neck retain a curious sheen, god is in my heart and tearing at the seams,
Her atheist tracts are certainly persuading.
(and I don't know, and I don't want to know, if she floats or drowns, if she floats or drowns.)",The Sad Witch
Hefner,"There's just a sea between us,
I know this hope will find us.
This serenade reminds us,
Be calm, be strong, be patient.

Just makes me stare and stare and,
You're a friend that really cares and,
You have a healing quality that I see.
But the sweetness lies within you,
And I swear I won't forget you.
When you're tying back your hair,
You have the prettiest of necks.
All the angels broke my heart,
Yes they really had a knack,
Because I loved life so,
And they didn't love me back.
But I swear it's not your beauty,
It's something inside,
It's the grace that you hide,
It's the sweetness that's within.
Beware of spiteful eyes because,
They know not what they do.
Wear clothes that look good on you,
And boys will flock from all of Europe.

I will wait for eternity and,
I belong between the angels knees and,

She doesn't listen but my word how I swoon when she talks,

The dirty talk that's what's bothering me,

And the gaudy walls of this rented property,
I think I'm watching too much porn on TV.
But I won't go upstairs with her if she talks to me this way,
And I'm not lonely, I'm just bored,

Her clothes are strewn over the living room floor.
I don't want to get laid I just want to be held.
She is unfaithful to a husband 5 miles away,
She lives alone and she rues her wedding day,

She married beneath herself that's what her girlfriends say.
Her smile is sad but not the saddest I've ever seen,
The saddest smiles are in the dirty magazines,
She made me laugh and now she plans to make me scream.

And petticoat hems are rising to high,
Romance is dead I think I see the reason why,

Hefner,"Don't flake out on me, Oh you promised you'd write before Easter,
And now you damn well know that it's Autumn, and I missed you through those summer months.

Oh you promised yourself you'd stop drinking and I know it's none of my business,
But you were mighty and graceful when sober, but all that gin, but all that wine.

We will always talk this way,
Tired and slightly jaded,
We will waste our tears and we'll be waiting years,
For the friends who always promised that they'd phone us.

We will always feel this way,
Faintly optimistic,
But we will speak the truth and we will never lose,
Oh the feeling that our hearts could be unbroken.

Don't wimp out on me,
Oh I know you've got the strength of 12 oxen,
I've seen you get through these things before,
Just like you've seen me get through these things before.

Making those eyes wet and weary
What was I doing with her photograph
Stapled upon my chest

I said that I´ve changed my mind
Don't want to wait and see anymore

Told a little truth
About the way she was feeling

She was eating far too much chocolate

Both of us being polite

Hefner,"I think it was in '83 my father left the family,
But came back three weeks later for a love both firm and stable.
I think it was in '91 that Lee Remick diedâ?¦â?¦
The sibling rivalry between my sister and me turned into the strongest branch of our family tree.
When I was young I dreamt of Lee Remick,
She had a ring upon each finger, she was smiling all the while.
Her hair was just long enough so it bounced upon her shoulders,
She said she always spoke the truth.
My Father let me down but I so easily forgave him,
And I know the home wrecker has a place within his heart.
I used to blame my mother for each and every failure,
And how Lee Remick's eyes sparkled that brilliant blue.
He looked just like a Jonathon but he said his name was Ashley,
He was my best friend till he drank so much his heart sank.
And all my pretty friends who just grew up and failed
And what if I fail? What if I've failed already?

She used to be my one and only true love,

Oh Mary Lee forgive me I am tempted, I am tempted.
She and I should drink more wine,

Just trying to make the days a little shorter so the night comes quicker when I see you.
But the food doesn't work, and the pills don't work and the silence hurts,
Can't make myself fitter for you no matter how I try.
And the science fiction helps just a little, numbs a little piece of me,
And the noise from the neighbors helps just a little,
Stops me from missing you.
And the stabbing in my heart it starts once too often,
Why won't you soften those blows?
Cause what you do to me stays with me,

You never really listened and I couldn't have expected you to know,
And now I hate everybody and everybody hates me guess I should have known.
The truth is an objective, only the strong hearted people know.
Well the girl kissed me, cause she had rocks in her head.
She had petals in her shoes, and me within her arms.
And she sung many hymns, which I couldn't understand.
She was breaking God's heart, I was twisting Mary's arm.
Now that I'm expecting everything I didn't think would ever come,
My heart is big and swollen and my lips are torn and bruised from having fun.

Inside the thought we find the urge,

The stupid can also feel the pain,
I have reasons for my joy, but not for being lame

Be strong for me when I can't be strong for you,
Be there for me but only if your true,
Though I try hard I will sometimes let you down,

So I did,
I was ecstatic for at least six weeks, oh,
Hope was placed in her hands when she caught me she asked me if it hurt,
I told her 'Christ it did.'
And it did,
When she left me every morning, oh,

I feel beautiful when she says I am beautiful,
But she is more beautiful.

I feel heavenly when she says I am heavenly,
But she is more heavenly.

Can't feel disappointed when her hips are that wide but I still feel lonely and screwed up inside,
And the taste of her tongue, it makes me wish I'd given up smoking,

To make a window, to make you mine.
It took a little look, that made you shudder,
It took a little tear to draw you near
But all the while you knew your smile,
Would make it easy to fall in love.

It took a little word, a stupid something,
To make you hold me, to make you cling.
It took a little stroke, from my hand,
To make you kiss me, to understand.

Would make it easy to fall in love.

Will you want me if I grow ill?
Will you want me when I grow colder?

There's far too many ideals fighting for the air time,
I was shameful back in â??96 but I'm not so careless now.
And all those brutal discos that taught me how to pine.
I've no regrets for what I did but I regret I had the time.

Will you want me? Is it too late?
Will you want me? Don't hesitate.
I've been spiteful, you've been kind,
Will you want me in six weeks time?

When you're in the bathroom and when you've locked the door,
I am dirty in the bedroom, I've not felt this way before.
Don't let my hands go idle, when they feel this much for

They never taught us what to do,

We taught ourselves the right from wrong.
And the punk rock kids, and the techno kids,

And the hip hop boys and heavy metal girls,
No, it's not their fault.
It was love, but Tories don't know what that means,
She was Michelle Cox from the lower stream,
She wore high-heeled shoes while the rest wore flat soles.
And the playground taught her how to be cruel,

We, Dutch white punks
Built up our gear
Hey, we made a difference, rock, rock, rock a black high school!

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mamelodi Melodies

We drove into
Another world and I
Could only stare at clouds from burning trash filling the air

And I felt like
A silly tourist on
A cheap trip into other people's daily misery

But I met cool blacks and whites telling me they really try
To fight against their prejudice, look each other in the eye

We, Dutch white punks
Built up our gear
Hey, we made a difference, rock, rock, rock a black high school!

Trinity for all my equal people takes over the space
Coz siyaphanda, siyakhanda sihloksa amakhanda
Ngoba sthanda sanda ngukfakeli sandla

Angsiza amandla sibe inkosi nabo ngok thanda

Hlanyisa umoya futhi sizokwenzu thuke
Thuka ngenjabulo uzbone uphuka khula sula

But your destination is unknown
Some pay the full ride but just get
A journey ending in the very first zone
They fight, hard, long but lose
Life may ignore the route you choose
They fight, hard, long but lose
Invalid tickets aren't of any use

Life's just a one way ticket
Which means there's no return
The road of life knows so many stops
But it's for sure you'll rot away or burn
Have fun, drink, fuck and die
From dust to dust, we're all passing by

We've got to break the public peace
Force those suckers down to their knees
We've got to make them show
That suit and tie guy can't play with us, oh no

We've got to stick together as one
Our fight ain't over, it has just begun
We've got to break the public peace
To save the ones we love, the kids, the trees

So tell your mommy you won't be home for dinner
And tell your daddy you do what he was too scared for
The fight for freedom within yourself
Don't rely on others, it's your choice and no one else's

We won't cut our hair to get a job
We won't act macho to become a cop
We won't suck your dick to be in your scene
We won't wear a suit that's what you call clean

We've got to let them hear our voice
If we want to survive, it's the only choice
We've got to go back to the basics of nature
To discover we're a hell of a creature

Break it, break it, break the public peace!

Get in the van, hit the road
Against the steam we swim
Another town, another club
Forever drink life to the brim

Different night, different crowd
Always pure 'n always loud
Give it all, a little more
Till I die, that's what I'm here for

Home is where the heart is
My heart is where the road is
Home is where the heart is
The road is where my home is

Like a dog we use to live
A lot to gain a lot to give
We have a dream, the four of us
Conquer the world in a broken bus

Modern nomads, don't stick too long
Unload the van and play our song
And if you wake, the morning after
Our ugly bus became a little wafter

Home is where the heart is
My heart is where the road is
Home is where the heart is
The road is where my home is

Home is where the heart is
My heart is where the road is
I try to find myself a way home
How far away can my home be?

No one ever does

For you 'cause

Nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
Nothing's wrong....but I fell down right from the start

Let's laugh, let's drink, let's just pretend
That I feel good
But at night, it gets to me, hits me like
A piece of hardwood
It's wrong, I feel fucked, can't play the clown
No more, no
I quit, find help, I'm getting out of
My own freakshow

Nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart

And listened while you re-invented your own past
And when I'd had enough and was on my way

Like Johnny and June,

Like Johnny and June,
More than life itself,
No-one else,
This endless promise,
They don't make love like that anymore,
Is that too much to be askin' for,

I wanna love like Johnny and June,
Rings of fire burnin' with you,
I wanna walk the line,
Walk the line,
Till the end of time,
I wanna love,
Love ya that much,
Cash it all in,
Give it all up,
When you're gone,
I wanna go too,
Like Johnny and June,

Like Johnny and June,
And when we're gone,
There'll be no tears to cry,
Only memories of our lives,
They'll remember, remember,
A love like that",Johnny and June
Heidi Newfield,"[Chorus]
Knocked up, shame, shame
I done ruined my family name
Here it comes
What granny's been dreading
Belly full of baby and a shotgun wedding
Hand me down crib and a pick-up truck
That's what you get when you get knocked up

Daddy hes a good looking guitar man
I was his from the very first kiss
I was thinking about me and him making some plans
But I sure wasn't planning on this

Still figuring right from wrong
Judging by the shape of my figure now

Is her hair as soft as mine,
Where does she live
Does she have any kids
Does her touch make you weak

What's it like to love her and to lose me
What kind of perfume does she like
Does she melt in your arms on rainy nights

How long have you known
I've known all along
What do the two of you read
What's it like to love her and to lose me

I hope she's everything you need and dream about
Don't let what we had keep you on your easy way out

Hurts like it was yesterday
Play with fire and your gonna pay

You just cause me frustrations
Tonight I'm gonna set myself free
I got my self a new recipe,

One match and a mighty big flame,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Lieder der Berge sind immer schön
Hör sie dir an, dann wirst du verstehen

Wie sonnig sind der Almenmassen

Am Felzrand seh ich Enzian blühen
Das Glück halt viel für mich bereit
Wie herrlich ist die Wänderzeit

Heir Apparent,"Dark figures dancing madly underneath the moon
Chilling cold of fright surrounds you here
Shivers running down your spine like frigid blades of ice
The wind blows applause throughout the hills
Nighttime brings vague and shapeless visions into view
Images of evil catch your eyes
Danger lies amidst the shadows everywhere you turn
'Cause in your dreams the darkness never ends...

Nightmare - faces in the dark surround you
Nightmare - images of Hell around you
Nightmare - nowhere left to hide
Nightmare - haunting you tonight

Memories of haunting voices burning in your mind
A strange uneasy presence in the air
Your heart pounds, your breath stops, you tremble with fear
Cast into a cauldron of despair
Caught within a wrath of torment every night you dream
Soon you'll be afraid to close your eyes
Imaginary fears are flowing like a steady scream
As you approach your midnight-mare

I watch it fade away

Will I be with you tomorrow night?

Let 'em ring, keep ripping 'til my lips get chapped
And you are now checking the best sound get down
My new mission in life is to tour and wreck towns
'til the other local niggas get mad and step down
Leave 'em all shook like they got the clap, ha-ha
And I couldn't give a fuck if you're feeling it
I outlined my rhyme book in chalk would you believe I'm killing it
The village idiot has got a lot of tales to tell
I'm a fool and now I'm knowing that these tales will sell
Put 2 and 2 together and you get a hole
A whole lot of cats trying playing out they roles
They, play, on, say songs through speech
I smile and exhale more than air like in green mile
I fell ill last year, so ill that I was bed ridden
So ill that when I came out MC's got masks
This illness never left, now when I talk I'm afflicted
This ill shit is stuck with me until my death, I laugh

For y'all to pretend to write
Despite the fringe benefits, penning this is my life
Tight lipped enough to suppress grins when bending mics

When that cinema plays images of last days, laughter is magic
It ain't the ripple in the riddle, the flow's undertow we patrol

Take the rhythm, strangle it and just rock, rock
Keep the beat like a clock, tick-tocking on

I've been sewing up a fat as crop I want to reap it
Move swiftly down the road, swinging low while your left lost

Wet up verses like a wave out of blue crush, must we
Keep annoying critics that think we even listen
I'm Felix, and in my position they would never get it

The last ceremony you'll ever have fucker

We gets down like the last ceremony you'll ever have
Burying cats, too many are too drab
In the lab, grabbing every thing we've got to keep it on lock
Blessed with the gift to move swift like agent smith
Can I get down? Oh yeah, no question 'bout that
Hotter than the flames on your message board
Forging out blades, melting metal, blacksmith with mic chord

Moving every proving ground to show we run right
We're ""zehrgut"" in Germany, in Chi Town we're raw

Seen you running from the club and you were looking desperate
Inspired to write, right after our set, your page is desolate

If I'm one of 'em the other nine won't sound right

Interlocks still the click, no I ain't done with it
I chase the raps like a cat at the club chasing digits
Paced to rip it,

But always keep it in perspective
For you dudes were new too
Here is our objective
Step onstage, get the face looking mean
Put in a little dirt and make it right like the A-Team

Stay to fight and make scenes when up against your team
You weigh the triple beam and rock guns
I leave the nipple clean and rock tongues just for fun

Swing a haymaker left and not rest 'til I beat it to death

Yet whenever I step, it retreats deeper into its nest
Just once, I wish to bridge the gap between me and that dude
The man I could've been after I realized that I had to
The type of cat to have past loves asking, ""Is that you?""
But that's cool, you still don't recognize when I pass, boo
I wish that I could hold feelings, 'cause feelings hold me
Together, yet broken, closely at arm's length from me
I sometimes wonder if these epiphanies will kill me
Creeping out of the deep, dark, corners of the real me

Lost moments of speech, snatched away by the wind
I guess it's time to look inside and find a line again
I revive my grin as I begin to spend the 5 or 10 minutes it takes to dive within and realign my Zen
Ask a poet where a song comes from, he'll tell you the soul
But the detail they fail to unveil is that the tale has been told
It's the air when it's cold, it's the parents that carried you home
It's what's scary in those areas where you won't dare me to go
In my hand I hold the soul of a poet
Hoping to throw it over the moat of Moet, and boats full of heads with no necks
Who protest against my inappropriate openness

While fleets of ships and angels float by
Heavy footsteps lead her down the hall and to the edge

Thoughts of self destruction brings her to her knees

New life comes from wiping dark tears off her eyes
Wherever she turns now there's nowhere left to hide

Helen Baylor,"I met an old friend today in the cafe on the hill
To see him after all these years somehow did not seem strange
We laughed and reminisced about the life we used to live
And I could tell at least with him that nothing much had changed
An invitation to the party was all he had to offer
Everyone will be there and all the high you need is free
As he checked the time and he paid the check he said we ought to hurry
And I could tell the one he was talking to .......was the old me...and I said

Look a little closer
Can’t you see that I have changed?
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Look a little closer
I’m not the one I use to be
I gave my heart to Jesus and He gave a brand new life to me

As we began to leave the table and started for the door.
In my heart there was a stirring and I knew there was something more
In his eyes there was an emptiness that only Jesus could fill
It reminded me of how I use to be before I accepted him...
After an awkward moment he broke the silence when he said
I hear about a savior or was it something that I’ve read?
But I don’t need religion there’s nothing to it anyway
I asked him if he wouldn’t mind if we took time to pray
Lord help him look a little closer
Help him feel your loving touch

Remove the blinders and change his heart surround him with your love.
Lord help him look a little closer...help him know that you are near..
Do for him what you have done for me...lord set my brother free!

Bless the lame to walk
Fed the hungry souls
But that's not where he stopped
Made the deaf to hear
Then removed the doubt and fear

Lazarus come up from the dead

He split the Red Sea to help his people go free

Worthy of my praise and 
Worth of my love

Is a miracle today

They were called in from the glen,
And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men.
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song

Keep the Home Fires Burning, 
While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.

Overseas there came a pleading, 
""Help a nation in distress.""
And we gave our glorious laddies
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""

And you were standing in the moon mist
I thought at first you were a dream
Until you smiled there in the moon mist

And though it's a dream, I never dreamed he'd ever say hello
Oh, maybe tonight I'll hold him tight when the moonbeams shine

 The walls of my room fade away in the blue, 
 And I'm deep in a dream of you.

 You come to my arms, may this bliss never end, 
 For we love anew just as we used to do 
 When I'm deep in a dream of you.

 Sweet music comes stealing; 
 We glide through a lover?s refrain.

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!

Helen Merrill,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything, 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe, 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

You can take to the left or go straight to the right,
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat,
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat.

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world,
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true;
But what am I supposed to do:
Read the writing on the wall,
I heard it when I was very small.

[Chorus]

Wash my hand in lye water, 
I got a date with the captains daughter. 
You can go and tell your brother. 
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong, 
I ain't gonna worry all day long.

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, 
My old car froze up last night. 
Ain't no reason to hang your head

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do

Helen Merrill,"It isn't by chance I happen to be a boulevardier, the toast of Paree,
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.","[Ah, The Apple Trees] When the World Was Young"

Waiting on the weary shore
I'm just a woman who's only human

How could he do it, why should he do it
He never done it before

Am I blue, am I blue
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue
Why, wouldn't you be too
If each plan with your man
Done fell through

There was a time
When I was his only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, lonely
Was I gay, until today
Now he's gone, and we're through

Should he rise from the depths of the ocean,

And the wish of my heart could be granted,
I would wish that you loved only me.",Boy on a Dolphin

Helen Merrill,"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die

Helen Merrill,"My blue horizon is turning grey
And my dreams are drifting away

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says ""no, no, you're not the same""

Helen Merrill,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare.

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.

I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.

If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,

Gave myself in that misty light

When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because I brings me back you

Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly

How many roses are 
Sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel

Helen Merrill,"Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes",I Used to Be Color Blind
Helen Merrill,"There may be trouble ahead,
But while there's music and moonlight,
And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.

Before the fiddlers have fled,
Before they ask us to pay the bill,
And while we still have that chance,
Let's face the music and dance.

Soon, we'll be without the moon,
Humming a different tune, and then, 
There may be teardrops to shed,
So while there's music and moonlight,

And love and romance,
Let's face the music and dance.",Let's Face the Music and Dance
Helen Merrill,"There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, lets go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you its so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people 
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Helen Merrill,"Many men with lofty aims,
Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any family will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

In everything that's light and gay

Your lips were warm, and love an' spring were new, 
But I'm not afraid of autumn, and her sorrow,

For flames and love live such a little while 
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely, (Oh, no)

Helen Merrill,"You took my kisses and you took my love,
You taught me how to care;
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave, 
There's nothing left for me to save.

All of me why not take all of me,
Can't you see I'm no good without you.
Take my lips I want to lose them,
Take my arms I'll never use them,

How can I go on dear without you.

So why not take all of me.",All of Me

But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

Helen Merrill,"There's nothing left for me of days that used to be
There's just a memory among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest
And though they do their best to give me consolation

I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

I find a broken heart among my souvenirs",Among My Souvenirs
Helen Merrill,"I'll take you home again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonnie bride.
The roses all have left your cheek.
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

[Chorus]
Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
to where your heart will feel no pain
and when the fields are fresh and green
I'll take you to your home again!

I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

[Chorus]

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

[Chorus]","I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen"
Helen Merrill,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars
Helen Merrill,"I may get around, I may laugh a lot
Now you'd think that I'd be happy with the life I got
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Ain't nobody really knows the inner side o'me

I may seem secure, I could have it made
You might think you see a lucky man who made the grade
Nobody knows what dreams I see
Ain't nobody really sure just who they wanna be

But everybody has a place and time
A chance to live, a need to find
We all got somethin' that we care about
I propose you find it out

It's not in a book, or a magazine
Or the stars who guide our fortunes on the silver screen
Nobody knows, it's up to me
Ain't nobody who can say it like it ought to be

I see my future at the rainbow's end
Happy hours, timeless friends
And if I ever chance to find my way
Rest assured, I will stay

You may see your life as a compromise
You may live to find the promise dancin' in your eyes
Nobody knows, it's meant to be
Let the magic of the moment say it all to me",Nobody Knows
Helen Merrill,"After one whole quart of brandy,
Like a daisy IÃ¢??m awake.
With no Bromo Seltzer handy,
I donÃ¢??t even shake.

Men are not a new sensation,
IÃ¢??ve done pretty well I think,
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink.

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

I lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He might laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me.

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I. 

HeÃ¢??s a fool and donÃ¢??t I know it,
But a fool can have his charms,
IÃ¢??m in love and donÃ¢??t I know it,
Like a babe in arms.

Lately IÃ¢??ve not slept a wink,
Since this half pint imitation,

IÃ¢??ve sinned a lot, I mean a lot,
But IÃ¢??m like sweet seventeen a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

IÃ¢??ll sing to him, each spring to him,
And worship the trousers that cling to him.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

When he talks, he is seeking,
Words to get,.off his chest.
Horizontally speaking
HeÃ¢??s at his very best.

Vexed again, perplexed again,
Thank god I can be oversexed again.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I.

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

Burned a lot but learned a lot,
And now you are broke so you earned a lot,
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more.

CouldnÃ¢??t eat, was dyspeptic,
Life was so hard to bear,
Now my heartÃ¢??s antiseptic,
Since you moved out of there.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

I have both wagered life and land,

Thy music still to play and sing;

And that yet once before I die,

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do
At the end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much,
And my voice is too loud when I'm out in a crowd,
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only 
That I'm lonely, and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at all.

So I smoke a little too much, and I joke a little too much,
And the tunes I request are not always the best,
But the ones where the trumpets blare.

Throw my heart away each Spring

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park

Now that's all in the past

For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic

I concentrate on you.

When at first your kiss I decline.

A maid with a way of whisp'ring ""si senor.""

Amapola, my pretty little poppy
You're like that lovely flow'r so sweet and heavenly,
Since I found you, my heart is wrapped around you
And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Helen O'Connell,"I used to be the apple of your eye
I had you with me every day,
But now whenever you are passing by
You're always looking the other way
It's little things like this
That prompt me to say:

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely presents you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

You're such a good rider
With such a good seat
As a provider
You sure can't be beat

Makes Scorpio lyrical
Don't think me satirical
'Cause that's what I feel

Our cosmic consciousness
Was raised by the power
It was fortuitous we met at this hour
And if our horoscopes will only allow it

We go together
We make a good team
Now and forever
We share the same dream

Helen Reddy,"If you wonder where I'm at
Got the big bucks, the bank roll's fat
Hey people, I'm not hurting
Give me a stage an' a big red curtain

I'm a star, hey baby, I'm a star
I dreamed real big
An' I took it far

I was born in Melbourne, Vic
Didn't fit in, I had to get out quick
Did not want rubies or diamond rings
Just had some songs that I had to sing

I'm a star, hey baby, I'm a star
I dreamed real big
An' I took it far

I don't care, I've got my mystique
I might be an angel, I might be a
From Vegas to Malibu

You all wonder what I do
Got two kids an' a man I love
An' a clenched fist in a velvet glove

I'm a star, hey baby, I'm a star
I dreamed real big
An' I took it far

Helen Reddy,"Lemonade in the shade
Of the Western trees
We got it made in the shade
Of an Easter breeze

The midnight sun
Has just begun
Midnight skies
In your eyes in the summertime

Serenade as we wade
Into Tropic seas
We'll let it play
Holiday kinda melodies

The midnight sun
Has just begun
Midnight skies
In your eyes in the summertime

Picnic baskets, no umbrellas
Let me tell ya, I love the motion
On an endless screen of deep emotion

Promenade, a parade
In the summer breeze
We'll masquerade, a charade
Of our fantasies

The midnight sun
Has just begun

Helen Reddy,"Thank you

It's really not a song
To make you sad and blue
It's a song of love
That's true

I thought I'd take the time
To sit myself right down
And thank you for the treasures
I've found

With my family, all of my friends
With my family and all of my friends
With my family, all of my friends and you

Yes, you've done your part
To try and help me out
That is what it's really
All about

Knowing that you care
Always makes me smile
You are what makes living
Worthwhile

With my family, all of my friends
With my family and all of my friends
With my family, all of my friends and you

You are responsible
For the impossible
You are dependable
You're not expendable

So leavin' you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain.

And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Santa came to say

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Helen Reddy,"You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school.
You're a little touched you know, Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you all right
Tell the radio good-night
All alone once more, Angie Baby

[Chorus:] 
Angie baby, you're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time, Angie baby

When he walks in the room, he feels confused
Like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud it spins him around
'Til his soul has lost it's way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover who
Keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side, Angie baby

Helen Reddy,"And do I love you ?
Well I know I really try;
Thinking of you;
Loving the sunshine in your eyes.

And when I falter,
Bringing you grief
Does it alter your feeling for me?
Oh baby can't you see?

That we're sharing,
All the ups we have in life,
While comparing,
All the downs that we've survived.

But how much stronger
Our love becomes.
And the longer we're living as one,
The more we'll overcome.

And I have lived the greatest love song,
That my singer's years have ever heard.
You make this weary woman happy.
I overflow, it's cause I know 
You wouldn't trade me,
For the moon inside a jar
For you've made me
Both the moon and the stars

And in our twilight,
We will recall, that the highlight
For us in this world,
Was having dreams come true.

And tell me, who will never let you down in any situation
Who will always see you get your share

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Your head against my arm.

Someday look and you'll find
Two hearts were blessed
Someday fate may be kind

Helen Ward,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading

At least it'll tell you how great you are.

Drives me to a door

Written by a maniac, his love has made me blind
Can't deny the poison gets me high

Shook my life, it hit me like a drum

A mambo, aiya
You make my heart move
Hey, hey, hey
Just like a mambo, aiya
I let it out

You were my obsession
Stuck into my heart
Never let you hit or run
Never set apart
Do it, do it, do it
Come and stay tonight
Wake up a little fantasy
Take a little bite
Can't you see? your love addicted me
Just a little taste, shook my life, it hit me like a drum

Und morgen früh küss' ich dich wach
Und wünsch' mir nur diesen Tag
Mit dir allein sowieso
Auf einer Insel irgendwo

Vertrau der Liebe blind
Geträumt, dass tausend Rosen fall’n
Mit dir im Sommerwind
Geliebt und gelitten, die Achterbahnfahrt der Gefühle
Denn heimliche Tränen gehör’ n doch auch dazu 

Solang dein Herz noch für mich schlägt
Solang die Liebe uns noch trägt
Hinter den Tränen wartet das Leben
Schmetterlings-leicht, unsagbar schön
Solang mein Herz noch für dich schlägt
Solang die Sehnsucht in uns lebt
Fliegen die Träume über den Wolken
Und nur wir beide mittendrin 

Getanzt auf einem Sternen-Meer
Verrückt, unendlich frei
Aus Angst dass ich dich mal verlier'
ist oft auch Wut dabei
Geredet, gestritten und Worte die trafen wie Pfeile
Verzeih’ n und vergessen gehört doch auch dazu 

Solang dein Herz noch für mich schlägt
Solang die Liebe uns noch trägt
Hinter den Tränen wartet das Leben
Schmetterlings-leicht, unsagbar schön

Weißt Du doch, ich komm zurück.

Nicht mal einen Augenblick.

Schick mich einfach los, die Welt entlang.

Es kommt doch immer wieder bei dir an.

Vielleicht bist Du ein Realist,
Dem Freiheit nicht so wichtig ist.
Doch ich, muss den Himmel seh´n.
Ich will bei Dir zu Hause sein,
Nur manchmal brauch´ ich Träumereien.
Für mich, du kannst das versteh´n.
Sperrst mich niemals ein,
Du lässt mich schweben,

Das alte Spiel, es war wieder mal ein Traum zu viel.
Und dann sah ich Deine Augen, da war nichts mehr wie es war.
Und irgendwas ist tief in mir passiert.

Hab es gleich gespürt
Im Zauber dieser Nacht war ich verloren.
Du hast mein Herz berührt,
Hast mich sanft verführt.
Ich konnte nichts dagegen tun.

So fand´ich zu Dir und die Liebe war stärker als wir.

Hinter den Tränen wartet die Sonne
und jeden Morgen geht sie wieder auf.
Unsere Liebe fängt an zu leben
und sie will fliegen ganz hoch hinaus.

Die Wunder und Zeichen, die sind schon gescheh´n,hast Du sie nicht geseh´n?

Helene Fischer,"Am Anfang war das Feuer so heiß wie ein Vulkan,

Komm flieg mit mir noch einmal hoch hinauf,

Am Anfang war das Feuer nicht nur für eine Nacht.

But now I'm found because you're mine

Sweet surrender now it's all that I can I feel
Sweet surrender, this time I know it's real
And like a wonder my heart was born again
I'm not afraid to give you everything
Cause that's what sweet surrender means

I almost feel ashamed, my heart, my everything
My weaknesses are there to see
But I don't care at all, I'll show you how I fall
Cause I know that it has to be

Helene Fischer,"Mit dir das war gleich ein Himmelsritt
Von Anfang an ein Blitzstart ins Glück
und oft ist es schon der totale Stress

Frag' mich wie hoch wird es noch geh'n
Hab' oft schon Angst nach unten zu seh'n
Es fühlt sich an wie auf 'ner Achterbahn

Mein Herz schlug nie so wild
Hab´ mich noch nie so frei gefühlt
Das ist nicht normal, ist nicht mehr normal

Nur wer den Wahnsinn liebt
Der kann mit Dir leben
Wer so tickt wie du
Kommt klar mit dir
Sonst würd´ ich nie bei Dir
Total den Kopf verlier´n
Nein, ich hab´ zum Glück
Auch so`nen kleinen Tick
Da oben drin

Du hast meine Welt völlig verdreht
Manchmal gibt´s nachts Frühstück im Bett
Oder ganz spontan geht´s mal nach Amsterdam

Tanzen im Bad Sterne berühr´n
Mit Dir kann mir fast alles passier´n
Bin sehr gespannt was da noch alles kommt

So hab´ ich nie geträumt
Niemals gelacht und nie geweint
Das ist nicht normal, Ich fliege aus der Bahn

Nur wer den Wahnsinn liebt
Der kann mit Dir leben
Wer so tickt wie du
Kommt klar mit dir
Sonst würd´ ich nie bei Dir
Total den Kopf verlier´n
Nein, ich hab´ zum Glück
Auch so`nen kleinen Tick
Da oben drin

Wahnsinn
Kein bisschen zu wissen, was morgen passiert
Wahnsinn
Kein bisschen zu wissen wohin das noch führt
Und wo das mit uns noch mal enden wird

Nur wer den Wahnsinn liebt
Der kann mit Dir leben
Wer so tickt wie du
Kommt klar mit dir
Sonst würd´ ich nie bei Dir
Total den Kopf verlier´n
Nein, ich hab´ zum Glück
Auch so`nen kleinen Tick

Helene Fischer,"Du machst mich und mein Leben groß,
Neben dir bin ich schwerelos.
Ich brauch' dich,
Ich mag' dich.

Weil du total aus der Reihe tanzt,
Ein Mensch wie du gibt dem Leben Glanz.
Ich brauch' dich,
Ich mag' dich.

Du bist ein Zauberer,
Der die Sonne fängt.
Du hast ein Herz aus Gold,
Das für andere brennt.

Du, bist ein Phänomen.
Du, kannst die Erde drehen.
Du, dich fängt niemand ein.
Der Wind trägt deinen Namen.
Du, bist ein Phänomen.
Du, manchmal unbequem.
Du, bist ein echter Freund.
Dein Wort hält Wort, lachst alle Schatten fort.

Du bleibst dir treu, lässt dich nicht dressieren,
Du fühlst die Erde im Takt pulsieren.
Ich brauch' dich,
Ich mag' dich.

Bei dir kann ich ohne Maske sein,
Zeigst mir die Wahrheit auch wenn ich träum'.

Helene Fischer,"Immer wenn du mal nicht bei mir bist
Wieder ein Abend unendlich ist
Flieg ich zu dir in meinen Träumen
Immer rufst du mich dann nachts noch an
Fragst mich ob ich auch nicht schlafen kann
Und wie mein Tag heut' war
Und dann sag ich wunderbar

Doch ich erzähl dir nie, von meiner Sehnsucht
Die immer größer wird, mit jedem Tag
Dass sie mich jeden Morgen weckt
Und mit mir schlafen geht
Auch das verschweige ich dir jede Nacht
Ich war schon immer so gestrickt
Weiß nicht woran das liegt
Hab oft um nicht zu weinen, gelacht

Wenn du mich danach durch's Handy küsst
Spür' ich viel mehr noch, wie schwer es ist
Die starke Frau für dich zu spielen
Manchmal würd' ich dann am liebsten schreien
Wann wirst du wieder nah bei mir sein?
Ich halt es kaum noch aus
Halt's wirklich kaum noch aus

Doch ich erzähl dir nie, von meiner Sehnsucht
Die immer größer wird, mit jedem Tag
Dass sie mich jeden Morgen weckt
Und mit mir schlafen geht
Auch das verschweige ich dir jede Nacht
Ich war schon immer so gestrickt
Weiß nicht woran das liegt
Hab oft um nicht zu weinen, gelacht

Du fehlst mir mehr mit jedem Tag
Wie lange bleibe ich so stark?
Wie lange noch?

Helene Fischer,"Ich hab' mit dir das Glück im Griff
Das dachte ich, nun sinkt das Schiff
Mit dem auch meine Träume untergehen
Ich fühl', wie du herum taktierst
Und sonnig lachst, obwohl du frierst
Dabei weißt du, wir müssen vorwärts sehen

Sag bitte endlich, wie es weitergeht
Und schon mich nicht
Zieh der Wahrheit ihren Schleier vom Gesicht

Vielleicht bin ich viel stärker, als du denkst
Dass ich dich liebe, weißt du längst
Doch lass ich mich niemals belügen
Vielleicht bin ich viel stärker noch als du
Und wenn's mal weh tut, lass ich's zu
Denn ich will dich verstehen
Lass unser Schiff
Nicht untergehen
Glaube nur an mich

Ich kenn' mich gut und ich kenne dich
Du bist die halbe Welt für mich
Doch lass uns Fehler klären, eh sie sich stauen
Du weißt doch, dass du reden kannst
Mit mir, tabulos, ohne Angst
Wir konnten uns doch immer blind vertrauen

Wenn du mich weinen siehst, dann denkst du wohl
Die Schuld hast du
Komm' und sieh mich an und trau mir mal mehr zu

Vielleicht bin ich viel stärker, als du denkst

Helene Fischer,"Hör' zu.
Manchmal beneide ich mich selbst,
wenn du mich in den Armen hältst

Denn das,
was mit dir kam, ist für mich neu.
Ich fühl' mich schwere-los und frei.
Für mich bist du der Mann.

sah ich, wie du mir, als du kamst,
die Fesseln von den Flügeln nahmst.
