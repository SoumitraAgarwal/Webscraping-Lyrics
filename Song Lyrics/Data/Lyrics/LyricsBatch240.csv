Kay Starr,"You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall 
So If I broke your heart last night, 
It's because I love you most of all",You Always Hurt the One You Love
Kay Starr,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you",Ain't Misbehavin'
Kay Starr,"Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?
And swear by the stars above you?

Could I repeat the sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

Could I repeat that sweetest story told?
Could I entreat, would it be too bold?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?

Kay Starr,"I don't know why, I made you cry
I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldn't be lenient with me
I hope you'll forgive and forget
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?

Kay Starr,"In this cloudy sky overhead now
There's no guiding star I can see
And I would be lost by each wild tempest tossed
Oh, if I didn't know of a place we two can go

There's a little cabin in the sky, Mister
For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow

We will be oh so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

And that is why my heart is flyin' high, Mister
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky

We will be oh so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

That is why my heart is flying high, baby
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky",Cabin in the Sky
Kay Starr,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me",Don't Worry 'Bout Me
Kay Starr,"It's a great feelin',
You suddenly find
The clouds are silver lined
When the sun breaks through.
It's a great feelin',
You walk down the street
And see the folks you meet
Smilin' back at you.

As long as I've got someone to embrace,
As far as I'm concerned the world is such a lovely place!

It's a great feelin',
Your credit is nil,
You'll never make a mill'!
But nontheless, I stay;
If you're in love 
You're feelin' great!

Oooh, what a feelin'!

The clouds are silver lined,
Yes, when the sun breaks through.

They're smilin' back at you.

Kay Starr,"You hold your arms open wide
You say come and lay by your side
If this is just another ride you're taking me on,
Then leave me alone

I'm not your part-time man
Love is more than now and then
I've enjoyed as much as this, as I can stand
So, love me or leave me alone

Love me or leave me alone
Love me or, baby,
Believe me, I'm gone
This time I'm gonna be strong

Maybe once upon a time,
I was young and love was blind
I thought I had finally made up my mind
It's sad, but

Believe me, I'm gone

Love me or leave me

Kay Starr,"There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present 
My future just passed. 

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me 
My future just passed. 

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
You can at least do this, 
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
Help me to win this miss. 

Here are my arms, may she find illusion there. 
Look in my heart, there is no confusion there 
Now that I'm loving, I'm living at last, 
My future just passed",My Future Just Passed
Kay Starr,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""

When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Kay Starr,"Day after day I'm waited patiently
And when the salty wind is blowin' from the sea
I pretend that it's breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

I always keep my window open wide
I like to let the friendly breeze come right inside
And pretend that it's breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

[Chorus]
Mr wind keep blowin' stronger because I must have that guy of mine
Well every day seems so much longer
Now don't forget each daylights savin' time
I get so lonesome waitin' days and weeks
When every breath of air that lingers on my cheek
Seems to whisper it's the breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

Day after day I'm awaitin' cause
The wind is a-blowin' from the sea
Well it's the sea the breeze the ship the sail that's bringin' my honey to me

I keep my window open wide
I like to let that breeze come right inside
Well it's the sea the breeze the ship the sail that's that's bringin my honey to me

[Chorus]

Well it's the sea the breeze the ship the sail 
That's bringin' my honey to me",The Breeze (That's Bringin' My Honey Back to Me)
Kay Starr,"I'm waiting for ships that never come in
I wonder where they can be

Life is only a game of poker
And ""happiness"" is the pot
Fate deals you five cards in the cradle
And you play, whether you like it or not

Some get a pat hand to start with
And the game doesn't seem on the square
When you look at your hand and discover
You were born without even a pair

But there's no use in kicking or squawking
Just pick up your cards and begin
To figure and plan and puzzle
While Fate looks on with a grin

Some take a chance at bluffing
And stake everything they've got
On a dinky little four-flush
And, sometimes, it wins the pot

Others will break up openers
To draw for a middle straight
They know what a chance they're taking
And they learn their mistake too late

Some can't help playing crooked
Against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it
And in the end, they'll pay the price

The most of us play straight poker
But I tell you, boys, it's hard
When you're there with both ends open
And you can't draw the winning card

Now I've always been a loser
It seems that I never can win
And I'm just a dreamer who's
Waiting for ships that never come in

I wonder where they can be",I'm Waiting for Ships That Never Come In
Kay Starr,"Someday, sweetheart,
You may be sorry
For what you've done
To my poor heart;
And you may regret
Those vows that you've broken,
And the things that you did to me
That made us drift apart.

Oh, you're happy now,
And you can't see how

Knowing that I'll soon find
Peace and contentment at the end of the road.

The way is long, the night is dark,
But I don't mind 'cause a happy lark

A love that will last past Saturday night
And I've got to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm
When those Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life, to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah

Wednesday or Thursday, Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothing baby

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song [*]

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's

In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see his now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.

And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for his bread and water,
While his husband has his breakfast in bed.

And the blossom in his cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.

How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take his in or hurl his to the walls?
Give his kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take his back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take his back
If she were even crawling on his knees.
Let his promise to atone,
Let his shiver, let his moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Kayak,"Say the word
Just one word that will force me to stay
That will keep me from running away
Some feelings have died
They withered inside

Please say it's all right
Change your mind 'cause I long for your touch
Can't you see I still need you too much
Why should we pretend
If love's reached the end

Unless there's a chance to succeed
Making up, you and me
In a life so complete
Love will soften all the pain

All those years
We have lived in a fool's paradise

Slowing drifting apart, telling lies
A fairy tale love
But not strong enough

To call back this heart on the run
Feeling lonely and blue
Won't you give me a sign and then
I'll turn to you
I know you'd want me to

But alas my love if leaving seems to be the only way",Sad to Say Farewell
Kayak,"There was a time I could freely breathe the air
No matter where I went, you would always be there
Carry me when I felt so tired I would almost fall
Did we speak and did I hear your name?
Feel no shame
Feel no pain

Wordless my poem, like a footprint in the snow
Telling you more than you'd even care to know
Passion came, I could not defend myself from you
Did we dance and did we think the same
Dream of fame
Feel no pain

Finally losing the fight we'd hoped to win
Climbing too high, then the air got poor and thin
Too late to turn back and too far run for cover, tell
Me
Did we touch and did we play the game
Take the blame
Feel no pain

Now should we take it as it is
What lesson did we learn from this
Though many dreams are lies untold
I see a world as pure as gold
Out there

I still believe it can be done
To dance the rite of perfect song
I tell myself this is a lie
'Cause masked dancers never cry
Nor care

I can't believe the things you've said
What happened to the dreams we've had
It must be some conspiracy
Of love and hate and jealousy
I don't know

A frozen mask, your hands are tied
Cold winds blow

A frozen heart, still deep inside

Kayak,"I've fashioned a sword, put it into a stone
I've sent it afloat, then the sea took it
In the perilous chapel it waits
For Arthur to raise it in front of you all
With this token of power the nation won't fall
It will shield you from evil and hate
The dragon died on that night, pointing out his
Successor

The hidden son to all unknown, came to fight the
Aggressor
The knights must be convinced
Challenging the prince
He'll bring you peace and victory, so why all the
Harshness
He'll unite the kings and rule the land, bringing light
After darkness
But nobles won't accept until he proves the fact
That the true king alone

Can draw the sword from the stone
Reaching out for the jewelled hilt, oh its burning like
Fire
To take the sword and claim their rights is their only
Desire
But failure shows them why
There's more than meets the eye
Arthur holds Excalibur, the invincible weapon
To fight the wrong and serve the right, I know he'll

Make it happen
This sword will make him stronger
Never to be conquered
Now the heir to the throne
Has drawn the sword from the stone
Now the king's unsurpassed as a leader of man
There's a scar from his past which he'll bear till the
End
Like a curse it will last

Dreamed by the gods, the dispensers of fate

Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

And forgettin' me on this side of Jordan.

Dare a man to change the given order.
Though they smile and tell us all of us are brothers,
Never was it true this side of Jordan.

Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves,

Nailed to some garden gate or boardin'.

Never hurted none this side of Jordan.

Listen Coolio, plus we can listen to my demo
Baby front as usual but u know, it's aight
When we was together, used to run into fights
But now I'm into something else, my musical mystics
Only thing my interest's my melodies and rythmics
Till the day I wake up, my life I gotta set up

Breaking chains of emotion

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Kazumi Watanabe,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As

since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.
Breaking up never, it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song, 
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.

ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness, 
I only reminisce.
The happiness we spent, we used to dance to the music
make romance to the music, 
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning 
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,

KC & the Sunshine Band,"Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah

The Supremes
(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.) 

You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
to hear a old love song
And want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song

KC Rebell,"Anhörung des angeklagten Hüseyin Köksecen.
Sie verzichten auf einen Anwalt und vertreten sich selber.
Nun, Sie haben das Recht zu schweigen.
Alles was Sie sagen, kann und wird vor Gericht gegen sie verwendet werden.
Möchten Sie aussagen?

Ich sage aus!

Wir haben einige Anklagepunkte
Und Tatvorwürfe, zu denen ich sie gerne befragen würde.

Zu viele Körperverletzungsdelikte, zu geringe Hemmschwelle.

Da wo ich herkomme, nennen wir das Respektschelle
Zu viele Pisser machen hier einen auf Babo
Ziehen einen Gramm Koks und fühlen sich wie Rambo
Sie lernten nichts von Respekt in ihrem Leben
Ich gehe allem aus dem weg, doch schau nicht weg wenn ich es seh'
Ich hab wirklich kein Interesse, doch leistest du kein Widerstand
Verwechseln diese Menschen Höflichkeit mit schwäche

Zu Ihren vorstrafen gehört auch schwerer Raub

Was man nicht macht in der Jugend wenn man Knete braucht
Und obendrein fehlte die Anerkennung in der Drecksgegend
Aber andern Menschen ihr Brot wegnehmen ist beschämend
Ich war ein Haufen Scheiße, heute begreif' ich's
Als mein Vater zu mir meinte, mit dem alter kommt die Reife

Ihr Umfeld ist gefährlich, die Gesichter kennt man

Ja, das sind Gangster, auch Sie könn' das nicht ändern
Die sind nicht wie Sie, ihr Leben ist verdammt schwer
Trotzdem sollte man nicht alle über einen Kamm scheren

Man sagt Sie seien schwulenfeindlich, es wird so geredet.

Ich nehm' kein Hintereingang, wenn es auch von vorne geht
Ist mir egal, sollen sie's machen wie sie meinen
Aber Reb-Rebell ist 100 Prozent Schwanz, in die Scheide

Äußern Sie sich bitte zu der Frauenfeindlichkeit.

Ich bin dominant, aber frauenfeindlich, nein!
Das Problem ist, Mann und Frau spielen heutzutage Rollentausch
Zu viele Männer haben an Frauen ihren stolz verkauft
Das macht kein Sinn, das ist Dreck und ist Gelaber
Zum Beispiel ist nichts so groß wie der Respekt vor meiner Mama
Ihr Wort ist mein Gesetz, ihr Lächeln ist mein Sieg
Ihr Leben heißt Frieden, ihre tränen heißen Krieg

Stimmt das, man sagt Sie vergiften die Jugend?

Klischee, ich nehm' lediglich den Stift und ich blute
Ich fress' es in mich rein, diese Krisen in mein Bauch
Ich öffne nur per Mukke mein Ventil und lass es raus
Sie lieben mich und denken, dieser Typ ist so wie wir

Anscheinend können sich die Kids mit ihnen identifizieren.

Ja richtig, eure Kinder kacken auf ihr Abi
Zeigen nur auf mich und sagen „das ist unser Abi!“
Sie hören nur auf mich und hören nicht auf euch
Sie schreien Reb-Rebell, als wär' es Hitlerdeutsch

Und das finden Sie gut? Was ist daran lobenswert?

Warum nicht? Ich bin kein krimineller Drogenkerl
Und auch kein Junkie so wie Sido, der sie fehl-leitet
Nur ab und zu wütend, denn auch mir geht's scheiße
Ich hab auch Probleme, ich hab' auch Familie
Meine Ex ist 'ne Fotze, ich hab' auch mal Krisen

Und warum tun sie Rapper namentlich zu Brei machen?

Sorry, doch die andern Rapper machen es mir einfach
Leben in 'ner Kleinstadt, erzählen was von Ghettos
Reden respektlos, ihr Leben sei gesetzlos
Alles monoton, reden so ein Straßendeutsch

Das stimmt und was war mit dem Moneyboy?

Hä was ich mit Moneyboy tat, ist was wo Meinungen sich scheiden
Doch auf irgendeine Weise war die Scheiße meiner Meinung
Peinlichkeit in Form von Millionen von Klicks
Für kurzen Augenblick war meine Vision so gefickt
Ich fühlte mich im Namen von Rap so beleidigt
Musste den Leuten zeigen, dieser Dreck ist so peinlich
Mein Song schickte ihn back an sein Hobbymic
Das hier ist Rap, auf dem Stempel ist ein Copyright

In Wien haben Sie gestichelt, haben da was erzählt.

Ja, ich war auf der Bühne und schrie, Raf Camora lebt!

Sie sind anti-alles und schwimmen gegen das System an.

Ich sterbe, doch verkaufe meine Seele nicht dem Sheytan
Widerstand, lieber blut' ich jeden Tag
Anstatt 'ne Marionette zu sein und tun was man mir sagt
Ich leugne mich nicht selber, das wär' ehrenlos
Ich bin Rebell, ich bin der Gegenpol
Und wenn ich ab morgen keine Platte mehr verkaufe, ist das schade
Doch kann vor meinem Spiegelbild behaupten, ich war grade!

Protokoll beendet, Sie als Bürger haben Rechte
Und genauso haben Sie auch ihre grenzen und Gesetze
Die sollten Sie lieber respektieren und auch schätzen
Das war's soweit es sei denn Sie wollen irgendwas ergänzen
Möchten Sie eventuell noch irgendwas berichten?

Ja! fick den Richter, nur Gott kann mich richten!",Anhörung

KC Rebell,"Ich weiß nicht, was ich will, vielleicht will ich dich auch nicht
Weil du ein Alptraum und zugleich ein Traum bist
Endlich ist es raus, diese Worte tun gut
Ich bin unentschlossen, du geschlossenes Buch
Entweder bist du die große Liebe meines Lebens
Oder das Ungeziefer meiner Seele
Entweder gehört nur dir mein Herz bis auf ewig
Oder du plus ich gleich Schmerz als Ergebnis
Ich denke, ich kenne nur deine Fassade
Das was wir haben ist nicht das Wahre
Ich weiß nicht, wird aus einer uns beide?
Ich kann mich einfach nicht entscheiden

Es tut mir leid, ich bin mir nicht sicher
Vielleicht heiraten wir, kriegen dann Kinder
Es tut mir leid, ich bin mir nicht sicher, vielleicht
Lassen wir es und sehen uns danach nie wieder und ich sag

Warum kann ich mich nicht mehr entscheiden?
Vielleicht steht die Antwort zwischen den Zeilen
Sind wir wirklich füreinander geschaffen
Oder fühlen wir uns nur von keinem Verstanden?
Haben all die Zeichen, dass ich mir nicht sicher bin

Pausenlos schrieb ich meine Zeilen auf dem Pausenhof
Wusste eines Tages werde ich einmal da draußen groß
Und die Lehrer sagten stetig
Du endest als Verbrecher hinterm Käfig, Rapper wirst du eh nicht
Lächelten nur hämisch. Keiner von ihn' glaubte dran
Ich auch nicht, doch war in meinem Traum gefangen
Früher wollte ich um jeden Preis Auto fahren
Ich dachte wirklich Freiheit wär' Autobahn
Ich musste betteln um ins Studio zu gehen
Hatte nur noch Rap im Kopf, konnte die Schule nicht mehr sehen
Mich hat nichts interessiert, ich war fest fokussiert
Ich fing an Rap zu studieren um Stress zu ignorieren
Und langsam fingen mich an die Hater zu lieben
Und auf meine Songs zu ejakulieren
Ich musste Gas geben ums ans Ziel zu schaffen
Niemals unterkriegen lassen, guck wie es bei mir war

Erst hassten sie, danach liebten sie
Viele meckerten rum seit ich anfing dieses Spiel zu spielen
Ich habe sie von meiner Mucke überzeugt und das ohne Major
Nun seh' ich nur noch Fans, guck ich brauche neue Hater
Oh aio aio aio, aio aio aio
Die alten sind Fans, ich brauche neue Hater

Prototyp, Photoshoot, Promomove
Mein Leben zieht an mir vorbei, Turboboost
Videodreh, Jetset, Turbos
Hotel Check-Ins rund um den Globus
Früher gab es für das rappen keine Pennys
Heute sag ich „Farid, komm wir jetten nach Miami“
ICE First Class, denn Autobahn ist Knast
Oder ich nehme den Flieger, denn ich brauche meinen Platz
Ab ins Studio, Joshi produziert
Ich bringe meine Zeilen aus dem Kopf auf das Papier
Danach rapp' ich meine Zeilen ein und checke dann wie gut das klingt
Wenn ich meine Mucke hör, bin ich wie jemand der sich Mut antrinkt
Wieder fangen mich an die Hater zu lieben
Und auf meine Songs zu ejakulieren
Während ich auf der Stage meine Konzerte oben gebe
Seh' ich andere Menschen von Konservendosen leben
Doch von nichts kommt nichts. Nichts kommt von allein
Hits, Songs und Punchlines. Hip Hop ist Krankheit

Es tut mir leid Mutter, es tut mir leid Baba
Wie viele Schanden hab ich schon über dein Haup gebracht.
Hab auf euch nie aufgepasst und hing' immer draußen ab.
Ich schäme mich so sehr, mir tut so viel leid.
Jede Träne, jeder Brief von der Polizei,
Ich schmiss die Schule hin und wurde kriminell,
Ich brauch gar nicht zu erwähnen was ein Kurde davon hält.
Was ich nicht alles auf der Straße so gedreht habe,
Es tut mir leid für jeden Tag in der PG Mama.
Tut mir leid auch wenn ihr heute nicht mehr böse seid,
Eines Tages bau ich euch dafür ein Königreich.

Gegen den Rest der Welt !
Kann sein, dass du dich nicht erinnerst jetzt,
Ich wollte so oft nicht hören, doch am Ende hast du immer Recht 
Heute weiß ich, dass du für mich nur das Beste willst,
Es tut mir leid, denn mein Leben war ein Actionfilm.
Ich würd' für jeden von euch mein letztes Blut lassen,
Denn alles was ich heute will ist Wiedergutmachung 

Es tut mir leid für jedes meiner Taten, für die Fehler, die ich tat
Und die Seele voller Narben, ich bereu' nichts 
Gestern war gestern, aber hätte ich die Wahl würd' ich es ändern.

Es tut mir leid, mein Schatz, ich hab dich sehr geliebt,
Ich musste so lange warten, bis dieser Schmerz verzieht,
Ich wollte, dass du's einsiehst und deinen Weg gehst,
Doch an manchen Tagen tut es noch extrem Weh 
Was ich wollte war der Frieden für uns zwei,
Doch beim besten Willen Schatz, ich kann dir nie wieder verzeihen.
Es tut mir leid, doch ich bereu es kein Meter.
Es tut mir leid, ich war zu Stolz für deine Fehler,
Ich hab einmal geliebt, war seit dem kein mal verliebt.
Ich hab geschworen ich heirate nie.
Tut mir leid, canim, tut mir leid ich bin zu hart im Kopf.
Es tut mir leid, dass dieser Junge von der Straße kommt.
Wir wissen beide, dass nicht jeder alles richtig macht,
Bruder tut mir leid ich habe öfter nur an mich gedacht
Hab mir meine Welt gebaut, denn ich hatte selbst ein Traum,
Aber ruf mich an, egal wie viel Geld du brauchst.
Ich bin dein Rücken, glaub mir ich bin hinter dir,
Keiner meiner Brüder soll nur eine Nacht im Winter frieren.
Ich bin hier und würde das niemals zulassen,
Alles was ich heute will ist Wiedergutmachung

In den eigenen Reihen sind die meisten deiner Feinde
(Gestern noch warst du meine beste Freundin

Ich hab früh gemerkt, dass man nicht jedem Menschen trauen kann
Freunde werden Feinde und entpuppen sich als V-Mann
Menschen, die dir was bedeuten, kehren dir den Rücken
Und versuchen, dein Leben lediglich zu ficken
Bruder, du musst aufpassen, wem du deine Hand gibst
Achte drauf, wer in die Augen schaut und wer dich anschielt
Vertrau bitte nie auf das Lächeln des Gegenübers
Ich kenne zu viele Lügner, die Messer ziehen auf die Brüder
Falsche Brüder lassen dich allein auf deinen Wegen
Doch wahre Freunde leiden mit und weinen deine Tränen
Bei all den guten Zeiten hast du 100 an der Seite
Doch sollt es dir mal schlecht gehen, hungerst du alleine
Hast du was erreicht, siehst du den Neid dieser Wesen
Sie legen Feuer und reden dich klein bei dem Nächsten
Ich red von falschen Brüdern, sie kennen den Respekt nicht
Das Lachen dieser Menschen wird zum Lästern, wenn du weg bist

Mit Sky Wodka Flaschen und Hazeys zum Paffen
Gegenseitig uns're Namen tätowieren
Durch die Welt reisen und dann mit Geld schmeißen
Mit mir auf Tour gehen, im Studio chillen
Dann hab ich 3 Fragen, die deine Illusion killen
Frage 1, sag mir, wirst du mich nie verraten?
Auch wenn du sonst in den Knast musst für viele Jahre?
Frage 2, was ist, wenn ich Flus brauche?
Würdest du mich supporten und deinen Schmuck verkaufen?
Frage 3, erträgst du für Schwesta Schmerzen?
Würdest du für Schwesta schießen, für Schwesta sterben?

Texte voller Leiden, die kein Lächeln mehr bereiten.
Wände die mich einengen, ich putze meine Kugeln. 
Ich suche Zuflucht in der Kaputze von meinem Hoodie, Brudi.
Yeah, ein Alptraum ich will raus davon.
Ich lauf davon. Hautfarbe: Grau, Beton. 
Wir werden groß geredet, aber klein gehalten. 
Umgeben von 'ner Menschenmasse fühlen wir uns allein gelassen.
Was für 'ne Welt. Man fragt nicht man nimmt. 
Man zahlt nicht, man klaut. Man redet nicht, man schlägt. 
Für's Leben viel zu spät, doch für's Sterben zu früh.
Ich bin Gefühlskrank, mein Herz ist ein Kühlschrank.

Komm in meine Gegend wenn du meinst, das Leben hier ist leicht
Es zerreißt meinen Schädel in zwei Teile, Kopfkino

Denn was ich wollte seit ich rapp' war die Gegend zu vereinen.

Denn seitdem ich Platz zwei bin

Sei dir sicher sterbt ihr ?

Aber dafür 24 Stunden lang auf Weed, Brudi. 
Adrenalin wenn du die Kripo's siehst. 
Street-Phobie, weil die kriminelle Energie nie verzieht.
In dieser Grauzone negativ gefangen, Bruder. 
Jeden Tag erneut wenn dir dein Leben aus der Hand rudert. 
Wir schieben Krisen, 24 Stunden, 7 ohne Liebe, 
Weil die Tiefe des Krieges zuviel Intrigen bietet.
Jeder zweite lebt hier auf THC, B-Block-Giro, 
Gib dir dieses Kopfkino und du hängst am EKG. 
Bruder diese Last auf deinem Rücken,der Hass. 
Du wirst wach in der Nacht, schweißgebadet und Nass. (Okay)
Halte die Augen offen, deine Feinde sind hier weit verbreitet. 
Keine Zweifel, dass sich dieser Neid verbreitet 
Dann wenn du alleine steil gehst.

Und diese Welt sie gehört dir.

Doch das Finanzamt ist ein Hund wie dieser Rantanplan
Mein Album sprengt alles, andale, andale
Warum sie mich lieben, denn bei mir stimmt das Gesamtpaket
Jeder Flow, den ich flow, jeder Hit, den ich kick
Jeder Rhyme, den ich rhyme, jeder Spit, den ich spit
Das ist ein ganz anderer Maßstab wie beim Stethoskop
Was Beef, ich rechne in Bars ab wie ein Gastronom

Rap- Raprebell, geh und lass mal deine Filme sein
Rap- Raprebell, oder ich knall ihn dir von hinten rein
Rap- Raprebell, mach nicht auf Prinzi wie Sissi
Rap- Raprebell, Rap Rebell, Rebellizzzy
Rap- Raprebell, geh und lass mal deine Filme sein
Rap- Raprebell, oder ich knall ihn dir von hinten rein

KC Rebell,"Okay, was machen ma' jetzt? Ja, lass einfach ein' neuen von null aufmachen. 
Ohne Beat, gar nichts oder was? Ja, einfach mal anfang'. 
Ja, gut, dann rapp' ich einfach und
lad du dir die, eh, Instrumental rein. 
Und, eh, Dann, 
Dann spiel einfach was dazu die ganze Zeit. 
Okay, machen ma' so. Ehem, yeah, okay.

Okay, los geht's, scheiß drauf, ich lasse den Wörtern freien lauf
Ich picke kein' Beat
Denn während ich gerade rappe, kann Juh-Dee ein' bauen
Fangen wir mal an, zuerst kommt der Satz
Den ich in meinem Kopf kreier', danach folgt der Bass
Genau der Juh-Dee, Brudi, der Bass ist okay
Genau den will ich, so muss er sein, lass ihn so stehen
Das ist was anderes, mein Freund, kein Ghetto-Lied
Was wir jetzt brauchen, ist noch irgendeine Melodie
Spiel was ein, ja, Mann, der Sinthy kommt gerade so super
Ich fühle mich auf diesem Beat, als hätte ich gerade die Nase gepudert
Wo ist die Kick? Genau, ja, ich will, dass sie sitzt
Bombe, und jetzt die Snare, Brudi, ohne geht nix
Juh-Dee, lass uns durchdrehen, mach mir 'n Bombenbeat
Ich zeige den Leuten heute die Bedeutung von dem Wort ""produktiv""
Dieses Ding wär auf eurem Album ein Hit-Movie
Aber auf meinem Album ist es nur ein Skit, Brudi
Gib mir die Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, weiter so
Ich kicke parallel meinen 1A-Flow
Die Stimme ist fresh und die Rhymes sind dope
Battlerap und kein G im Ghetto, ich könnte dich übertrieben wegflowen
Komm schon, gib mir die Dupstep-Elemente rein in diesen Beat und let's go
Locke der Boss, poppe dein' Kopf, komm in dein' Block
Boxe dich Schrott, zerleg' kein Wort, lauf lieber fort, ab in dein Dorf
Ich bin enorm, heut voller Zorn, komme hervor
Gebe dir Missgeburt heute noch Folter und Mord
Rap ist ein Kindergarten und ich bin der Hort, yeah

KC Rebell,"Ich fühl mich wunderbar
Ich bin ein- Superstar

Ich danke jeden Menschen
Die Kassen sind am brennen
Wir machen's independent.
Ich spitt mit Erfolg;
Die Jeans sie ist neu
Nichts mit Perwoll.
Und du brauchst nicht zu Haten
Saug lieber Penis

Ich bin ein Star wo ich wohne
Ich stapel die Kohle
Statussymbole.
Und andere Rapper sind neidisch
Und der Grund? Sie sind hässlich und peinlich.

Ich hab keine Interesse
An deiner Fresse.
Du lebst lieber vorm Sozialamt
Aber ich muss nie wieder mit der Bahn fahrn'.
Wo flieg ich hin? China oder Japan;
Lisa oder Lara;

Sag wer redet noch schlecht;
Die Brille von Ray Ben steht mir perfekt.
Und meine Brüder, sie sehn' das;
Spüren da geht was
Ich grüße dich später.
Für nen' Lilanen schwitzt du dein Arsch ab;

KC Rebell,"Weißt du noch, unser aller erstes Treffen?
Ich erinnere mich so gut an dein zuckersüßes Lächeln
Von dem Moment an wollte ich immer nur noch bei dir sein,
Ich war so eifersüchtig, bei jeder Kleinigkeit
Ich erinnere mich, an die alten Tage Babe,
Ich habe in jedem Typen, eine Gefahr gesehen
Ich hatte Angst vor einer Zeit in der du nicht mehr da bist,
Heute bist du nicht mehr da, es treibt mich in den Wahnsinn
Weißt du noch, als ich zum ersten mal deine Hand nahm?
Und dir sagte, „du brauchst von nichts und niemanden Angst haben?“
Weißt du, dass ich wusste, das du dich da sicher fühlst,
Ich kann es dir nicht mal erklären, ich habe es gespürt
Weißt du noch? unser aller erster Streit?
Ich fing' an zu schreien und du hast sofort geweint
Mein Engel, dein Blick war mit Schmerzen verziert,
Als ich mich umdrehte und ging tat es mir mehr weh als dir 

Mein Engel, ich trage Risse in meinem Herz 
ich vermisse dich so sehr
Es tut mir so leid
Ich will die Zeit zurück drehen, bis zum letzten Tag, 
denn Heute weiß ich das, die Zeit mit dir die beste war
Zurück drehen, und so vieles ungeschehen machen,
Ich würde dich nie wieder gehen lassen 
Ich will die Zeit wieder zurück drehen 
Ich will die Zeit wieder zurück drehen 
Und nur ein Teil von meinem Glück sehen

Weißt du noch, meine aller erste Rose?
Unser aller erstes Foto, und die aller erste Pose?
Ich machte dir Geschenke, Ich wollte dich glücklich sehen
Du meintest „Schatz, ich würd' mit unter der Brücke leben“
Ab dem Moment wusste ich genau das du das Wahre bist,
Du warst mein Sonnenschein, du warst mein Tageslicht
Du kamst nicht klar auf die ganzen Weiber die mir schrieben,
Ich meinte hab vertrauen denn du weißt das ich dich liebe 
Weißt du noch, unser aller erstes Date?
Du bist gegangen, denn ich kam 5 Minuten zu spät
Du wolltest das ich dein Wert schätze, dich für Voll nehme,
Was du nicht weißt, du warst von Anfang an mein Goldmädchen
Weißt du noch, unser aller erster Kuss?
Ich spürte deinen Herzschlag, tief aus deiner Brust !
Und, weisst du noch? Unsere aller erste Trennung ?
Aus Sturheit und Stolz ,Wir beide wussten das geht schnell um

Mein Engel, ich trage Risse in meinem Herz 
ich vermisse dich so sehr
Es tut mir so leid
Ich will die Zeit zurück drehen, bis zum letzten Tag, 
denn Heute weiß ich das, die Zeit mit dir die beste war
Zurück drehen, und so vieles ungeschehen machen,
Ich würde dich nie wieder gehen lassen

KC Rebell,"Ich wollte grade bleiben auf meinem Weg hier raus
Jetzt, wo ich fast am Ziel bin, merk ich, es geht nicht auf
Wenn das 'ne Prüfung ist, ich nehm's in Kauf
Ich seh wie diese Menschen Hass kriegen, nur durch den Mercedes-Sound
Mein Plan war's irgendwann hier raus zu schaffen
Jetzt wollen sie Auge machen
auf dem Weg zu 100.000 Platten
Zehn Millionen Klicks und die Probleme beginnen jetzt
Ignorieren ist der Weg, raus aus diesem Spinnennetz
Es sind die eigenen Komplexe, die sie scharf machen
So, als hätt' ich Mord begang', Erfolg war meine Tatwaffe
Gnadenlos, allesamt nur schadenfroh
Doch stehen diese Menschen ganz alleine vor mir war das alles gar nicht so
Ich behalte den Fokus und lass mich nicht mehr bremsen
Die Macht in meinen Händen, in der Stadt eine Legende
Rebell solang ich kämpfe
auch wenn sie mich zutiefst hassen
Wollt es nur ans Ziel schaffen und meine Musik machen
Jetzt wollen sie glücklich werden durch meine Vernichtung
Verhasst in jede Richtung, geblendet von der Missgunst
Schreibe mit Feuer und hab deshalb an der Hand Verbrennung'
Redet was ihr wollt, euer Neid ist meine Anerkennung

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde
Yeah, ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität

Riech den Neid in der Luft, dir bleibt nur noch Frust
Weil sich auf der weiten Welt kein Schwein für dich juckt
Ich bin oben angekommen und das bereit dir Druck
Doch in Wahrheit macht dich dein eigenes Leid nur kaputt, Bruder
Deine Denkweise, guck, sie macht voll keinen Sinn
Du kriegst das Kotzen, wenn du hörst, dass ich erfolgreich bin
Jetzt ist es offiziell, KC ist der Überflieger
Je höher ich komme, fällst du in deiner Psyche tiefer
Seitdem ich auf der Zwei war, seh ich so viel Neid
Ungerechtigkeit macht sich breit auf dem Weg zur Eins
Wenn Blicke töten könnten, würd' ich jetzt im Grab liegen
Sie würden gerne den Plan schmieden und scharf schießen
Sie wollen dich runterreißen, von der Karriereleiter
Wegbegleiter, die sich wünschen, dass du in dei'm Leben scheiterst
Was willst du machen, wenn sich Neid in deiner Gegend breit macht?
Ich bet für alle meine Feinde an jedem Freitag
Du bist besessen, in dein' Träumen siehst du mich verrecken
Doch ich bin Rebell, ich bin hart, ich bin nicht zu brechen
Und wenn es sein muss, schieß' ich mit der Smith & Wesson
Ich fick den Richter, weil nur Gott richtet, und das dürft ihr nicht vergessen

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde
Yeah, ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität",Auge
KC Rebell,"Bist du da? Sag ein Wort, damit ich's glaube
Deine Stille wär ein Dorn in meinem Auge
An meiner Seite ist der Ort, wo ich dich brauche
Also tu mir ein' gefall'n, lauf nicht mehr fort, komm doch nach Hause
Bist du da? Dann merkst du, dass ich Wärme brauche
Kälte wäre wie barfuß über Scherben laufen
Falls du kommst, zeig mir kurz deine Nähe
Dein Rücken wäre jetzt der Sturz in die Leere
Bist du da? Gib mir ein' Funken an Achtung
Ignoranz wäre wie im Dunkeln zu tappen
Falls du kommst, bist du Licht in der Dunkelheit
Kaum bist du weg, erlischt meine Munterkeit
Bist du da? Dann beweise es mir doch bitte
Denn jeglicher Zweifel wär' wie im Treibsand zu versinken, ich
Finde so schon die Gefühle instabil, es is'
Wie den Boden unter den Füßen zu verlieren

Bist du da?
Das frag ich mich seit Wochen, weil
Jedes Mal, bekämpfen wir uns schlimmer

Bist du da?
Die Frage blieb mir offen, weil
Jedes Mal, denk ich, es bleibt für immer (immer) immer

Bist du da?
Bist du da?
Bist du da?
Bist du da?
Bist du da?

Bist du da? Gib ein' Ton von dir bitte
Schweigen wäre jetzt der Stoß von der Klippe, aber
Wenn du redest, solltest du dringend zu deinen Worten stehn'
Und solltest wissen, keiner zwingt dich wieder, fortzugehn'
Denn bist du da, dann gibt es mir Ehre
Deine Nähe ist das Gift, das ich nehme
Ohne dich ist jeder Schritt, den ich gehe, ein
Blick in das Leere, ein Stich in die Seele
Bist du da? Dann zeig es mir vom Herzen
Deine Abwesenheit wär meine Reise ins Verderben
Falls du kommst, solltest du leise sein und merken
Jedes Wort aus deinem Mund ist wie mit 'nem Stein auf mich zu werfen
Bist du da? Dann sag ich wäre Schuld dran
Jeder Satz, auch wenn er schlecht ist, nimmt Last von meinen Schultern
Falls du kommst, solltest du eigentlich so fair sein
Und alles in die Fresse sagen, damit ich weiß, dass du es ernst meinst

Bist du da?
Das frag ich mich seit Wochen, weil
Jedes Mal, bekämpfen wir uns schlimmer

Bist du da?
Die Frage blieb mir offen, weil
Jedes Mal, denk ich, es bleibt für immer (immer) immer

Bist du da?

Wenn du lächelst fällt mir nur eins ein, Ronaldinho
Prinzipien sind gesetzt, doch eine Weise frage
Ist es eigentlich schlimm, darf ich Arme wie Beine haben?
Denn wir trainieren keine Beine, du siehst meinen Brustkorb wachsen
Und du lässt dir höchstens deinen Brustkorb wachsen

Check dein Girl ab und mach mit ihr im Taxi rum
Wir schieben Welle wie der Ozean, baller Cameron Diaz
Während du einen Schwulen am Telefon hast, so wie Domian

Du bist niemand, über dich wird gelacht
Der Schmerz sticht dein Herz
Die seelenlosen Sorgen
Von wegen du wirst niemand
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht

Du bist niemand, man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Du bist niemand, über dich wird gelacht
Der Schmerz sticht dein Herz
Die seelenlosen Sorgen
Von wegen du wirst niemand
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht

Wer bist du schon, du brauchst meine Lieder
Wer bist du schon, außer ein Niemand
Wer bist du schon, was hast du auf dieser Welt geleistet
Jeden scheiß Tag dieselbe Scheiße
Kopf ist gefickt kein Geld und Pleite
Du fällst so schnell und bist schwer gezeichnet
Wackelig über beide Beine
Kein Bock keine Kraft schottest dich ab
Fort von der Stadt, du kleiner Feigling
Hast große Träume und dafür hart geackert
Doch die Lehre einfach so abgebrochen
Auf dieser Welt ist keiner draußen
Zum Millionär über Nacht geworden und
Wenn einmal dein Geld nicht reicht
Versinkst du direkt in Selbstmitleid
Tu doch was wenn du selbst nichts machst
Hilft dir auf dieser Welt kein Schwein
Alter heb dein Arsch hoch, noch paar Jahre so und du lebst am Bahnhof
Du hast gechillt, dann musst alles, was du versäumt hast eben nachholen
Gib dir selber Kraft red dir Mut ein
Habe bitte keine Angst zu Versagen
Kleine Schritte du musst Handeln und Wagen und an manchen Tagen auch danke sagen
Sei rebellisch wann wehrst du dich
Hör auf zu träumen warum kämpfst du nicht
Fang bitte heute noch an mein Freund
Bevor man dich auf dieser Welt vergisst

Du bist niemand, man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Du bist niemand, über dich wird gelacht
Der Schmerz sticht dein Herz

Von wegen du wirst niemand
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht

Wer bist du schon, du brauchst meine Lieder
So grau wie das Klima, deine Aussicht fällt tiefer
Wer bist du schon, außer ein Niemand, ich weiß es nicht
Jeden Tag fällst du aus deinem Gleichgewicht
Bitte schweige nicht denn so reißt du nichts
Du bist immer nur auf der Suche nach Feinden
Gepeinigt vom Neid einsam allein
Immer reif für den Feind, bitte bleib nicht dabei
So erreichst du ein scheiß junge zeig mir Geist
Ich will Stärke sehen weil dir die Werte fehlen
Das kommt mir so vor als wäre dein Herz gelähmt
Bruder schwer zu verstehen
Doch um etwas zu sein musst du Schmerzen erleben, Berge bewegen
Wird Zeit deinen Arsch hochzuheben
Träumst du auch von Millionbeträgen
Auf dieser Welt ist alles möglich, aber bitte hör auf nur groß zu reden
Du hängst mit den Jungs und machst draußen auf Per
Aber ich chill am Strand mit ner Aussicht aufs Meer
Glaub mir du kannst auch etwas werden
Bleib stramm jag deinen Traum hinterher
Auch wenn dich alte Tage einholen
Leg dein IPhone mal kurz beiseite bro
Psyco alle schlagen ihre Zeit tot
Aber für dich geht jetzt die Reise los
Sei rebellisch wann wehrst du dich
Hör auf zu Träumen warum kämpfst du nicht
Fang bitte heut noch an mein Freund

Pack mal richtig einen aus

Hast den drauf, Juhdee?
Ja, Mann
Mach mal dings, Alter, mach mal, mach mal daraus irgendwas
Nutz den als Soundsample, mach mal 'nen Beat draus, komm, Bruder.
Okay, kein Ding

Dieses Mal auf dem Soundsample von Onichiwa
Ein paar miese Parts, die auf dein' Kopf brettern

Wer ist Brock Lesnar? Dieser Schrottcatcher
Ich lass ein' fahr'n und du denkst, es ist ein Orchester
Hier kommt der King und der Ficker bei euren Scheiß
Drecksfressen hilft nicht mal der Instagramfilter
Du bist einer von den süßen Homes, viele Grüße, Homes

Allein mein Skit sollte euch Hanswürstchen reichen

Verdammt, bin ich eitel, Juhdee, Brudi

Das tut mir wirklich Leid für dich
Ich habe grade keinen Grund zu lieben
Denn der Schnee ist geschmolzen, ich erkenn dein Gesicht
Zwischen dir und mir gibt es ein paar Unterschiede
Keine Kompatibilität mit deinem zweiten Ich
Du willst mir ständig meinen Mund verbieten
Ich fühl mich wie in lebenslanger Schweigepflicht

Irgendwie hab ich die Vermutung, du willst nicht mehr
Dann geh doch, kein Bock auf dieses Hin und Her
Du weißt nicht, ob du lieben oder hassen sollst
Und bist der Ansicht, dass du's lieber lassen sollst

Jedes Wort von dir wie'n Messerstich
Hoffentlich komme ich hier lebend raus
Ich glaub, du hältst dich für was Besseres
Du zählst mir ständig meine Fehler auf
Mein Kopf platzt, weil du nur am Meckern bist
Du hast 'ne Schraube locker, du bist eh gestört
Deine Argumentation ist so lächerlich
Du solltest dich mal selber reden hör'n

Geh doch, geh doch

Geh doch, geh doch
Geh doch, geh doch
Geh doch, geh doch
Geh doch, geh doch

Du versuchst mit deiner Art und deinen Wörtern
Mich manipulativ reinzuwaschen
Das Ziel von jedem Wort, was du sagst
Ist mich indirekt bei allem kleinzumachen
Ich glaub, jetzt ist die Zeit gekommen,
Um Stopp zu drücken und einmal Halt zu machen
Zurückzublicken, gut nachzudenken,
Und gegebenenfalls hier alles sein zu lassen
Oh, was passiert hier? Am Anfang war der Streit so klein
Mittlerweile keine Kleinigkeiten mehr,
Weitaus mehr als keine Reibereien
Ja am Anfang sind die Menschen blind und reden groß
Ja und wie, kein Jahr verfliegt
Und der Partner bildet auf einmal den Gegenpol
Anstatt zu reden, den Kampf annehmen,
Den ander'n seh'n und sich anzupassen
Scheinen wir uns damit abzufinden,
Nicht sonderlich super zusamm'nzupassen
Es macht alles keinen Sinn mehr,
Bitte versteh's doch, ich seh's doch
Habe dich aufgefordert zu geh'n,
Aber du stehst noch, bitte geh doch
Bitte bitte bitte bitte bitte bitte

Geh doch

Was bist du für ein Hayvan?
Was ich für ein Hayvan bin?
Ich zeig dir jetzt mal was ich für ein Hayvan bin

Schwarzer Anzug, Lackschuhe, Tennissocken
Auf der Bühne Stehen und einfach in die Menge Rotzen
Mit Veganern ins Steakhaus geh'n
Händchen halten mit Groupies, die nach AIDS aussehen
Auf der Verlobung deiner Ex besoffen unterwegs
Und sie unauffällig Fragen, was am Wochenende geht
Ey, mein nächstes Album einfach „Detox“ nennen
Den Mund voller Essen haben und Beatboxen
Mal eine Cheesy ohne Käse bestellen
Dir ins Ohr Flüstern, dass mir dein Mädel gefällt
High Five sagen und direkt danach die Hand senken
Kool Savas zum Geburtstag einen Kamm schenken
Bei schönem Wetter einfach draußen Kacken
Mesut Özil bitten, er solle kein Auge machen
Geld Scheffeln, aber Second Hand tragen
Bei der Krankengymnastik nach Happy End Fragen

Wer sagt, das Leben wäre einfach?
Viel zu viele Pläne sind gescheitert
Scheißegal, ich gehe immer weiter
Augen zu und benehmen wie ein Hayvan

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Bei DSDS schreien „Drecks Dieter Bohlen“
Auf der Autobahn links Blinken, rechts Überholen
'Ne Flasche Gin Trinken, gegen den Wind pinkeln
Auch mal ein Witz Bringen über Sillas Blickwinkel
Einmal nein Sagen können zu den Eltern
Auto ohne Lappen und Motorrad ohne Helm Fahren
Ferris MC sagen, er wär schön
Bei Todesstille Furzen, in der Badewanne Fön'
Schlampen taufen, an der Tanke rauchen
Maskiert und bewaffnet in die Bank zu laufen
Nutten Schlagen, einmal Rucksack tragen
Den Löffel Wegschmeißen und die Suppe Gabeln
Besoffen einen Joint Kiffen
Und dann die Freundin von 'nem Freund Ficken
Und vielleicht sogar den Freund Ficken
Schwören und die Finger dabei Kreuzen
Und falls man auffliegt, es immer noch Verleugnen

Wer sagt, das Leben wäre einfach?
Viel zu viele Pläne sind gescheitert
Scheißegal, ich gehe immer weiter

Ich hab seit Wochen nicht geduscht
Doch meine Haarfrisur, sie steht
Und trotzdem riech' ich gut
Kein „Hallo“ und kein „Wie geht's“
Ach Bruder, lass mich mal in Ruh

Ich bin ein Hayvan von Beruf

Ihre Fotze zähl ich zu meinen engsten wie den Tod
(Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife)
Sie will bös' meinen Schwanz nuckeln
Klöten und Sack lutschen und
Schön vögeln als krönenden Abschluss, Punkt
Am Anfang noch war ihr Loch so klein
Aber mein Schwanz macht wie Anabol Fotzen breit
Sie will noch mehr Sex, auf dem Trockner Sex
Sie ist scharf aufm Tisch wie beim Opferfest
Sie scheißt auf Kondome, will mein Schwanz lose
Ich mach es wie die Joghurtmarke dann ohne

Head in a bed, head head in a bed
Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife

Head in a bed, head head in a bed
Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife

Head in a bed, head head in a bed
Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife

Niemand bleibt bis zum Ende verschont
Irgendwann kommt dich der Rebell mal holen
Auch dich, du brauchst gar nicht erst zu hoffen
Denn irgendwann sind alle mal betroffen

Head in a bed, head head in a bed
Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife

Liebt sie mich oder nicht, Kopf oder Zahl?
Ich hab's gehört heut ist dein Hochzeitstag
Dein Neuer tut mir jetzt schon Leid
Dass das so schnell nach mir kam lässt mich kalt
Mir geht's tip top 1a und Klasse
Dein Macker soll ein Spießer sein, scheint ja zu passen
Ich würd's gern sehen nur noch einmal deine Fresse jetzt
Wenn ich dir sage du kannst bleiben wo der Pfeffer wächst
Ich schaute oft genug weg bei deinen Fehlern
Doch du fingst an mir jeden Tag Dreck zu erzählen
Hattest Streit mit mir, doch musstest mit deinem Ex drüber reden
Wenn ich's mir recht überlege musst ich mich echt übergeben
Du bist ein Eisbrocken, Unmensch, ein heftiges Wesen
Ich mach alles für dich und trotzdem lässt du mich stehen
Verpiss' dich, das Maß ist jetzt voll, ich habe genug
Ich schwöre ich werd' nie wieder kommen wenn du rufst

„Hallo?“

Du
Hast mein Herzblut
Noch immer seh' ich dich
In meinen Träumen
Du
Hast mein Herzblut
Noch immer fühl' ich dich
In meinem Herzen

Es tut mir Leid für gestern Schatz, ich war die ganze Nacht verwirrt
Und bei den Mailbox Nachrichten alkoholisiert
Ich bin ein Feigling, ich trau mich nur in das Diktiergerät
Egal was ich gesagt hab Schatz, ich hab für dich gelebt
Damals noch war ich ein armer kleiner Bandit
Der vieles versucht hat, aber kein Para in der Hand hielt
Für all mein Geld dank ich dir heut, Schatzi
Denn ich wollt es nur dir beweisen, mein allergrößter Antrieb
Ich liebe dich noch genau so wie am Tag eins
Manchmal erkennt man den wahren Wert im Nachhinein
Ich dachte ich bin, über dich hinweg
Und das ich eine Neue habe hat nicht gestimmt
Sorry das war eher so 'n taktisches Ding
Denn die Beziehung mit deinem neuen Macker machte mich blind
Ach ja, apropos dein Macker, lass den mal weg
Ich weiß, dass dieser Bastard meinen Platz nicht ersetzt
Und ich weiß dass ich oft Mist baute, und dir misstraute
Du mir die Wahrheit gesagt hast, aber ich nichts glaubte
So viele Fehler, doch hab Nachsicht
Deine zerkratzte Motorhaube an deinem Auto, das war ich
Ich weiß ich bin ein Depp und bei weitem nicht perfekt
Doch solange ich noch atme nimmt keiner dich mir weg
Es tut mir Leid, mein Kopf ist so gestört
Entweder du oder der Tod, weil dir mein Herzblut gehört

Du
Hast mein Herzblut
Noch immer seh' ich dich
In meinen Träumen
Du
Hast mein Herzblut
Noch immer fühl' ich dich
In meinem Herzen

Denn ich benutz ein' Hula-Hoop Reifen als Cockring
Du willst mich verarschen, ich lass dich durch die Gun sterben
Denn man kann mich nur per Bodypainting anschwärzen
Ich bin ein Playboy, ficke eure Mütter gut
Frauen drehen mir nur beim Arschfick den Rücken zu
Deine Mutter will mein' Cock gleich haben
Doch ich halt nichts von der Bitch außer den Kopf beim blasen
Und am Hochzeitsabend geb ich an Mösen Schwanz
Welche Nutte sagt, es kommt nicht auf die Schwanzgröße an?
Wenn ich grade nicht Shisha rauch
Dann siehst du mein Glied im Maul einer Spielerfrau
Mütter werden gefickt am 30. Mai

Kanax in Moskau, sie möchten kein Guntalk
Und Ferris sieht aus wie der Glöckner von Hamburg
Kanax in Moskau, ich lass Kate Moss kauen
Und rede nicht von Shisha wenn ich Kohle auf den Kopf hau

Deutschland will Gesetze über Scheiden einführen
Ich will mein' Schwanz in Scheiden einführen
Verriegel Scheiben und Türen, denn wenn der Rebell dich erschlägt
Wurdest du wie die 12 Apostel zum letzten Mal gesehen
Das ist Gangster-Rap im Unterhemd, ich bin der, der deine Mutter bangt
Ich fick' den Bachelor im Dschungelcamp
Und du bist bei den Bullen ein Zinker
Denn du willst verpfeifen wie ein guter Schiedsrichter
Dreh den Sound laut, Reb-Rebell Bosssound
Gangbang mit Top Frauen, Kanax in Moskau
Im Vollrausch, der King macht Ärger
Du hast an deinen Lippen Sperma wie Hitzelsberger
Komm ich zeig dir, dass Rap nicht mehr als Disses ist
Zeige dir, wie verhurt deine Misses ist
Beef mit mir wiss-sess-sess das ist wie'n Zebrastreifen
Die anderen gehen wenn ich stehen bleibe

Pimmel in die Kimmy, Hier spricht der Zorn!
Ich wurde mit 'nem grimmigen Blick geboren, es stimmt
Das seit dem ich Starke Drogen nehme
Mit elf, den ersten Joint gepufft mit OCPs
In meinen Träumen kann ich nachts Tote sehen
Um Mich herum mit einen verdammten Bogen drehen
Barack Osama alle Loben den
Aber Ich will ihn nackt am Boden sehen!
Ich mag ihn nicht, ich hass' den so gesehen
Und wünsch seinem Zuhälter Sack- und Hodenkrebs!

Und Maschieren bis das Blut an meinen Händen klebt

Ich glaub es war er der mich gestört gemacht hat
Er war nebenbei mein Lehrer in Geographie
Und nebenbei der aller größte Neonazi
Meine Zeugnisse waren voll bös
Und wollte lieber mit dem goldenen Pimmel die voll gepickelte Nicole ficken
Meine Noten waren immer wieder „Ungenügend!“
Ich glaub das war das Gras in meinem Lungenflügel, mir war's
Scheißegal wer unterrichtet, denn ich war eh voll wie meine Fehlstundenliste
Rückblickend hab ich blanken Mitleid,
Verdammt, bin ich seit meiner kranken Kindheit
Gps, ich werde abgehört!
Mir geht es ziemlich schlecht ich bin so krass gestört!
Rap, Rebell Rapstar, Hannibal Lecter, die Narben von Ribery, waren nicht Extra!
Ich will dein Fleisch gut durchgrillen!
Wer bitte will meinen Blutdurst stillen?
Alarmstufe Rot, hol die Cops!
Oh mein Gott Ich bin so bekloppt!

Und Maschieren bis das Blut an meinen Händen klebt

KC Rebell,"Steh auf, das Wasser ist längst eingefroren
Draußen ist das Leben schon an dir vorbeigezogen
Die Falten deiner Ma werden immer mehr
Hoffentlich hat sie sich noch nicht dem Sterbebett genähert
Deine Taschen sind voll, doch im Herzen bist du leer
Jedes weitere Versäumnis wäre so verkehrt
Sie zerfallen Tag für Tag zu Staub, die alten Tage
Dein Vater hat mittlerweile nur noch grauweiße Haare
Du bist auf Reisen mit Freunden, denn draußen bist du frei
Aber sag mir bitte, wann bist du zu Hause mal allein?
Wann hast du das letzte Mal dein' Neffen in den Park gebracht?
Mit ihm ein' Tag verbracht, wann war das mal?
Immer lachst du, als wäre das so leicht
Wann hast du das letzte Mal unter der Bettdecke geweint?
Das Einzige, was dir noch fehlt, ist die Einsicht
Aber merk dir eins, es ist erst zu spät, wenn es vorbei ist

Your heart is broken up, ey
Several relationships, you're runnin' away
So tell me where you wanna go?
A life without hope
'Cause you are here
Swimmin' in an ocean of broken dreams
If we are here (ey)
Save you from the misery
And we sing, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Du bist down, steh auf, ich weiß, du fühlst dich unten
Draußen hat das Leben dich schon überrundet
Seitdem du 18 bist, streunst du rum und machst nur Mist
Hoffst, dass Gott dir alles vergibt, aber was, wenn nicht?
Ich glaub es dir, bei dir ist jeder Tag stressig
Aber meinst du nicht, du hast dein' Glauben zu vernachlässigt?
Dein Leben bis heute solltest du eigentlich stornier'n
Ein kleines bisschen formier'n, du hast zwei Drittel noch vor dir
Du bist erst 25, aber denkst, du bist der King
Eine Frage, wann warst du das letzte Mal ein Kind?
Du denkst, du bist ein Player mit dein' One Night Stands
Dabei fehlt dir eine Frau, die dich liebt und dich schätzt
Die loyal zu dir steht, deinen Nachnamen trägt
Wach auf, vielleicht ist es in paar Jahr'n zu spät
Und du musst so vieles im Leben noch erreichen
Merk dir eins, es ist erst zu spät, wenn es vorbei ist

Your heart is broken up, ey
Several relationships, you're runnin' away

Du hast vieles für dein Traum aufgegeben
Genau an diesem Punkt hast du aufgehört zu Leben
Du bist dir viel zu oft zu edel und zu eitel
Genau an solchen Punkten ist dein Leben doch gescheitert

KC Rebell,"Meine Kette glänzt in weis-silber
Aber was mich wirklich zufriedenstellt, ich hab kein' Schimmer
Meine Konten machen Luftsprünge
Aber meine Seele lebt sei 2 Jahren unter Brücken
Hab' Augenringe, weil ich Tagelang nur wach bin
Ich kauf' mir eine Villa, aber schlafe auf Matratzen
Bin öfter in Hotels und bin draußen
Das Geld schick' ich nach Hause
Doch bekomme meine Eltern nicht zu Augen
Jetset-Life, aber innerlich leer
Egal wie oft ich fliege, ich komme dem Himmel nicht näher
Mein nagelneuer Benz C63 AMG
Fährt 300 KM/h, aber zeigt mir nicht den Weg
Anstatt Schmetterlinge
Habe ich Steine in meinem Bauch
Ein tausend Bitches, aber keine echte Frau

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix
Auch wenn unwichtige Dinge dir so rar erschein'
Hat alles seinen wahren Preis und du bist

Jeden Tag auf's neue nur ein Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger

Meine Seele ist ein Stein mit jedem Lächeln im Gesicht
Fress' ich Tränen in mich rein, ich bin müde
Mir fehlt die Kraft, ich bin schlapp
Und der 5 Sterne Kaviar macht mich nicht satt
Mein Schuh Louboutin in creme-beige Elfenbein
Geht den Weg nicht von alleine
Und hält mich nicht auf Bein'
Die Uhr in meiner Hand, sie glänzt und ist am Scheinen
Doch verändert einen Scheiß', sie schenkt mir keine Zeit
Kurt Cobain, am besten eine Kugel setzen
Doch diese Kugel würde ebenso meine Mutter treffen
Geld stinkt, diese Scheine machen arm
Denn hast du deine Taschen voll, behandelt keiner dich normal
Bist du was, wird hinter'm Rücken dreckiges gesagt
Aber drehst du dich mal um, dann lecken sie dein' Arsch

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix
Auch wenn unwichtige Dinge dir so rar erschein'
Hat alles seinen wahren Preis und du bist

Jeden Tag auf's neue nur ein Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger

Ich habe soviel Sonne gesehen
Doch die Wärme nie gespürt
Egal wie gern' ich das auch würd'
Ich hab' die Sterne nie berührt
Es ist die Frau, die ich nicht habe
Oder der Benz der mich 'von ablenkt
Sind das alles gute Freunde? Oder Menschen die am' Sack hängen?
Außen kalt, doch tief in mir brennt's
Ich hab Frieden mit jedem, doch Krieg mit mir selbst
Keine Zugehörigkeit, ich bin überwiegend draußen
Ich bin überall, doch fühl' mich nirgendwo zuhause
Ein vierundzwanzigstundenlanger Winter der mich plagt
Der Pulli von Versace hält mich irgendwie nicht warm

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix

Ich hab euch so vieles zu erzählen über meine Wunden
Deshalb brennt die Stimme so wie Dynamit in meiner Lunge
Ihr seht zwar diesen Typen posen in sein' Gucci-Schuhen
Aber nur, weil er nix hatte, vielleicht ist das meine Genugtuung
Und du denkst, ich hab Fuß gefasst in der Rolle eines Superstars?
Mich selbst verwirklicht und mein Hobby zum Beruf gemacht?
Das stimmt nicht, ich hab meine heile Welt eingetauscht
Um Hype und Geld, Mamas Wolldecke gegen feinen Pelz

Ich hab euch so vieles zu erzählen über meine Wunden

Vielleicht hab´ ich dir kein Enkelkind geschenkt, Baba
Aber wie auch, wenn es in mir brennt, Baba?
Du hielst mich für einen vernünftigeren Weg bestimmt
Auf meinen Schritten ins Verderben warst du Gegenwind
Vielleicht ist das, was ich mache nicht was du wolltest
Aber heute seh´ ich deine Augen glitzern weil du stolz bist
Bin oft weg, doch du bleibst in meim´ Gedächtnis
Ich sterbe beim Gedanken, das die Zeit mit dir begrenzt ist
Du bist der Kopf und die Art wie ich so denke
Die Beine die mich tragen und die Arme die mich lenken
Ich beschütze dich vor allem, meine Schwester
Du bist mein Leib meine Seele und der Herzschlag
Ich werde immer bei dir stehen, ich bleib´ für immer
Meine Nichten und Neffen sind auch meine Kinder
Es gibt keinen der mich auf Beinen wie meine Schwester hält
Und mein Bruder, wir drei gegen den Rest der Welt
Bruder, du hast es am schwierigsten von allen
Doch trägst in dir die größte Liebe von uns allen
Ich würd´ mein Lachen eintauschen gegen dein Leid
Mein Feind ist dein Feind, und dein Feind ist mein Feind
Deinen Platz bei mir, den kann dir keiner nehmen
Ich würd´ auf Knopfdruck sterben, damit du weiterlebst
Alles Hunde, alles Strolche
Doch wir sind Ehrenmänner, wir sind zwei Wölfe
Wir wissen beide nicht, wohin der Wind uns weht
Doch werden mit uns gehen, egal wohin wir gehen
Und jetzt du, du bist das Schönste auf der Welt
Du bist meine Königin der Welt
Meine Mutter, das Blut das durch die Adern fließt
Unter deinen Füßen liegt das Paradies
Du bist das Herzstück, hast mich immer verstanden
Ich weiß, ich bin immer mit dir in Gedanken
Ich muss irgendwo ans Mic und muss live rappen
Doch weiß meine Mama weint, weil ich weit weg bin

Du bist der einzige Schutz den ich habe
Du bist die Hoffnung für alles wenn ich Krisen schieb´

Ich bin gleich auch bereit, und ich weiß
Meine Zeit, sie ist reif

Irgendwann kommt der Mann mit der Sense
Und dann hat dieses Ganze ein Ende
Hoffentlich gibt's nur Freudestränen
Hast du gelernt, nicht gebeugt zu gehen?
Sahst du Licht, egal wie dicht die Bäume stehen?
Würde es bedeuten, du hast nichts bereut im Leben
Die Zeit kommt und du musst einsehen
Nur Glück, Family und die Gesundheit zählen
Nach dem Tod bleibt nichts lebendig
Materielles ist vergänglich
Gut, dass in dein Leben ein paar der Heuchler kamen
Somit weißt du, wer die wahren Freunde waren, ah
Was hast du viel gelacht
Was wohl deine erste Liebe macht?
Warst dir sicher, dass sie einfach perfekt ist
Was ist, wenn du sie geheiratet hättest?
Du denkst dir „Bitte lass mich verschont“
Da hilft dir auch kein Talisman holen

Auch, wenn er nicht auf der Gästeliste steht
Schau auf deine Uhr, deine Zeit tickt, tickt
Dem Tod ist egal, ob du 30 bist
Vierzig, fünfzig, Oder nur acht
Ich hoffe, mein Onkel hat's oben geschafft

Ich hab zu viel von meiner kostbaren Zeit
Verschwendet, den oft gab es Streit
Keiner, der mir 'ne Postkarte schreibt
Ich würd' alles geben, um mit euch nochmal zu sein
So viele Dinge würd' ich ändern, Bro

Ich sage, ich hab´ das schon lang nicht gesehen
Dein Duft ist perfekt, die Haare sie stehen
Auf einer Skala bis zehn
Bis zu klar eine 10 eine Barbie mit Brain

Mit dem Vorwand wir wären wie Tarzan und Jane

Und erzählen mir was von ihren Kopfkissen

Du willst wissen, wie viel noch so kranke Plagen dir das Leben zeigt
'Ne Stunde an der gottverdammten Straßenecke stehen reicht
Mohamed, der Juden hasst, Peter, der Muslime hasst
Der Hass unter den beiden Parteien ist übertrieben krass
Kevin geht fremd mit Aisha, doch ist auf Sender
Denn seine Frau ihm durchbrennt mit einem Ausländer
Die Schuld ist gleich, doch für ihn ungerecht und hart
Denn tief in sich trägt er einen Fleck, der uns nicht mag
Sie finden unsere Bauchtänzer saugeil, essen unser Essen
Aber wollen heimlich Ausländer raus! Schreien
Wenn Ali in der U-Bahn irgendwem die Nase bricht
Ist Mehmets Studium auf der Uni direkt fragwürdig
Für manche Menschen, die in unseren Ländern Urlaub machen
Sind wir in ihren Ländern nur Kanaken
Und wer sagt, dieser Text wär' bescheuert
Ich zahl' sechsstellig Steuern
Eine Frage, Alter, wer ist jetzt Deutschland?

Auch, wenn du dich umguckst und du Menschen siehst, die rumspinnen

Wenn irgendwo 'ne Kugel trifft und damit Blut erzeugt
Hab ich nix damit zu tun, mein Freund
Nicht jeder von diesem Dreckshaufen ist so wie wir
Das sind nur Menschen, die den Glauben falsch interpretieren
Ihre Psyche ist kaputt, angeblich hören sie auf Allah
Sie lügen wie gedruckt, aber schwören auf Koran
Ob Sunniten, Schiiten, Aleviten, wir sind alle gleich
Noch einmal die Menschen voneinander trennen? Danke, nein
Ob ich irgendeine Menschenrasse hasse, nein
Aber geht es um Unterdrückung werf' ich als erster den Stein
Manchen Frieden erlangst du nur durch Waffen und Krieg
Her Biji ich bin Enkelkind von Salahidin
Und wer sagt, dieser Text wär' behindert, ist ein Enkel von Hitler
Und wer anders denkt, denkt wie ein Spinner

Living in the age of deceit
So sieht unsere Welt aus, KC
Vielleicht haben wir es nicht anders verdient
Vielleicht müssen wir auf unsere Knie
Und beten „Gott, lass nix Schlimmeres geschehen
Lass uns irgendwann aufrecht vor dir stehen
Und keine Unterdrückung mehr sehen
Denn so kann es nicht weitergehen

Jeder Schmerz, jeder Hass, jedes Leid
Jedes Glück, jede Träne, jeder Stolz macht uns gleich
Jede Wut, jeder Trost, jeder Frust macht uns gleich
Du sollst nicht nur respektieren, nein, du musst
Vielleicht bin ich nicht wie du
Und pass' dir nicht als Moslem
Vielleicht kränkt mich deine Meinung
Lass sie einfach in deinem Kopf drin
Auch wenn es einen Menschen gibt, der denkt, so wie du
In' Spiegel schaut, sich selber nicht erkennt, so wie du
Vor seinen eigenen Problemen weg rennt, so wie du
Innerlich hasserfüllt brennt, so wie du
Sein wahres Potenzial so verschenkt, so wie du
Bin ich am Ende des Tages auch nur ein Mensch, so wie du

Also differenzier' nie wieder
Egal, ob schwarz, weiß, arm, reich, hart, weich, dir egal
Es ist ganz egal, welchen Mensch du zur Seite hast
Der Respekt bleibt der gleiche, Mann

Auch, wenn du dich umguckst und du Menschen siehst, die rumspinnen
Solltest du besser in deinen eigenen Problemen schwimmen
Egal, was du siehst, was du lebst, was du bist, was du denkst

Einmal pro Tag wäre leider untertrieben

Ich möchte wirklich keinen Vortrag halten
Grade ich nicht ich habe noch vom Vortag Alk´drinn
Aber am Mic bist du eh weit unten, live bist du eh die Schwuchtel
Light wie Diät-Produkte, dein Hype ist doch eh erfunden
Dein Ding ist viel zu klein für eine Penispumpe
Du machst dick auf eins mit deiner Mädchentruppe
Du gehst heimlich ab auf KC´s Mucke
Solange dein Mund nach Scheiße und nach Käse muffelt
Mach´ mir kein´ auf Fly in deiner Kegelgruppe
Ich hab´ echte Supporter und keine Juli-Fans
Die die boxen wollen, so wie Hooligangs
Da kannst du gerne jede Straßen-Hure fragen
Ich ficke Fotzen bis sie danach Nasenbluten haben
Sie sagt, ihr Arsch wär Jungfrau
Doch wenn ich meinen Big-Cock reinhalte
Ist sie hinten offen wie ein Flip-Flop
Und sie spingt durch die Gegend, so wie Criss Cross
Weil der Big-Boss fett rappen kann, wie Rick-Ross
Ich übernehme diese Scheiße hier mit Farid Bang
Wen willst du was beweißen mit deim´ Ami-Slang?
Und du willst direkt pfeifen nach den Razzien?
Somit bist du ab sofort freiwild, wie die Nazi-Band

Und wieso redest du von Body-Mass-Index

Kommen in Texten mit mehr Schränken als die Möbelindustrie
Sie pöbeln, wollen Beef, verkörpern einen G
Verklickern ein paar Fans sie wären ein Mörder auf der Street

ihr Gehirn ist inaktiv
Kippen in das Feuer somit Öl oder Benzin
Und halten sich dann wirklich für das Größte was es gibt
Scheiß´ auf den Rest und mach´ mein eigenes Ding
Nur weil ich jetzt singe mit ein paar Flöten in mein´ Beats
Heißt das nicht, ich trage Röhrenschnitt in Jeans
Ich bleib´nur an keinem Punkt, ich setz´ mir höheres als Ziel
Am Ende des Tages ist Musik die Königsdisziplin
Ich förder´ dieses Spiel, mit gehörig Appetit
Höchst intensiv um mit einen mörderichen Trieb
Trotzdem töte ich die MCs, behalt die Klöten, bleib stabil

Mittlerweile haben sie böses im Visier

Und verlieren sich in Verschwörungstheorien

Und hab den Schlüssel zum Erfolg gesucht, das Mercury-Prinzip
Hater gab´s immer doch mit gehörig Disziplin
Wurden alle umgestimmt, auf einmal hören sie´s auf Repeat
Ich sag das G-Rap zu alt klingt, Street-Rap bekommt Falten
Da wurde es doch einmal Zeit für diese Schönheitschirugie

KC Rebell,"Hallo Schatz, das ist mein vorvorletzter Brief
Ich geb' es zu, ich war vor paar Monaten noch depressiv
Ohne Lebensziel, ich hatte nix zu lachen
Denn die Situation, in der wir uns befanden machte mir zu schaffen
Aber ich schwör' auf meine Mutter
Mir geht's jetzt besser
In diesen einsamen verfickten Nächten
War Geld und Alkohol mein Lebensretter
Ich bin jetzt wieder bei Vernunft
Und ich geh' gechillt damit um
Du siehst doch auf Instagram ich mache wieder Bilder mit den Jungs
Wochen her, dass ich dein Facebook das letzte Mal gestalkt hab
Ich hatte sogar Auftritte bei dir in Nähe, direkt in deinem Dorf da unten
Und du, zählst wohlmöglich noch die Kröten in deinem Teich
Und ich weiß, dass du weißt
Ich zähl jetzt Kröten wie ein Scheich, aber egal
Scheiß mal drauf, es war schön mit uns zu zweit
Ich hör lieber auf mit Details, ansonsten tötest du dich gleich
Ich habe null-Komma-null-Prozent, in meinem Wohlstandsbauch noch Wut
Aus und gut, ich hab' mir das ausgesucht

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Hallo mein Schatz, das ist mein vorletzter Brief
Du kannst dich ab jetzt sofort ficken alter, Rest in Peace
Nicht, dass mich das kratzen würde
Aber glaubst du wirklich dass ich noch irgendeinen
Verfickten Gedanken übrig habe für dich?
Denkst du echt, das juckt mich
Wenn du mich auf Facebook blockst?
Das Kleid, was du gestern gepostet hattest, steht dir top
Denkst du echt ich weiß nicht, du lädst Bilder hoch mit diesem Bastard?
Weiß er, dass wir gefickt haben, während ihr miteinander zusammen wart?
Weiß er das?
Hat er eigentlich Geld, kann er dich ausführen?
Du nennst mich ein Stalker, nur wegen dem Zelt vor deiner Haustür?
Normal stalk' ich dich, du machst doch Schluss ohne Grund
Ich weiß sogar welchen Wagen du fährst und Duft du benutzt
Ich weiß sogar verdammt gut was du gestern noch gemacht hast
Schwer fiel mir das nicht, weil ich dein Handy angezapft hab, ich hab
Für dich nix mehr übrig
Außer Wut
Aus und gut
Wir haben uns das ausgesucht

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Hallo, das ist mein letzter Brief
Heut' komm ich raus aus der Klapse und der Therapie
Unsere Beziehung hielt elf Tage und acht verdammte Stunden
Ich streu' ab heute kein Salz mehr in die Wunde
Ich wusste, dass du Kinder hast
Und glücklich in den Staaten lebst
Deshalb war die Art und Weise von mir der falsche Weg
Ich seh's heut ein, dass es mittlerweile acht Jahre her ist, alles
Was ich gemacht habe, macht man nicht ehrlich
Auch wenn du mich angezeigt hast, sag' ich Danke mein Schatz
Denn mein Psychiater schaut mir zu
Aus und gut
Du hast dir das ausgesucht
Und es bleibt nix zu reden

P.S. Man sieht sich zwei mal im Leben",Nicht mehr normal
KC Rebell,"Es ist mittlerweile acht Jahre her, und du
Findest nie wieder Platz in meinem Herz
Ich liebe dich nicht mehr, und ich kann dich auch nicht hassen
Ich wollt´ dir nur sagen du hast einen Brand hinterlassen
Du bist mir gleichgültig, da ist einfach nichts
Hey stimmt das das jede Beziehung nach dir gescheitert ist?
Denn dieses Kopfabschalten und den Gefühlen freien Lauf lassen
Musst ich irgendwann mal ausschalten
Heute denk ich mit dem Kopf, denn mein Herz ist auf Eis gelegt
Denn dafür hab´ ich mit dir viel zu viel Scheiß erlebt
Ich lernte nach dir Frauen kennen, sowie Engel
Doch konnte ihnen mein Vertrauen nicht mehr schenken
Das war so nicht fair
Ich hab Menschen mit 'nem großen Herz 'ne reelle Chance verwehrt
Und die Antwort darauf wieso es nie mehr wird wie's war
Ist ganz einfach

Wir waren Porzellan
Ich hab' uns bloß in die Ecke gestellt
Und übersehen wie perfekt es war
Bis es zu tausend Teilen zerbrach
Wir waren Porzellan
Und alles was danach kam
Waren billig Imitate
Denn sowas wie wir ist rar

Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren, wir waren
Wir waren Porzellan

Ich hab einmal geliebt
War seitdem keinmal verliebt
Ich hab geschworen ich heirate nie
Doch heute besieg ich diesen Fluch
Reiß den Schmerz aus der Seele
Und hoff' er kommt nie wieder zu Besuch
Du warst das längste Kapitel in meim' Buch
Doch um das Schlusswort zu erreichen war die Liebe nicht genug
Gute Männer lieben schlechte Frauen, ist was ich heute weiß
Und gute Frauen lieben schlechte Männer, ein Teufelskreis
Ich könnte dich nicht mehr berühren sogar wenn ich will
Für mich und meine Seele bist du eine Brennessel
Ich wünschte das wär alles nicht passiert, meine
Erinnerungen, ich begrabe sie mit dir
Doch muss noch oft dran denken, nachts in meim' Bett
Über diese eine Frage, was wäre wenn?
Und die Antwort darauf wieso es nie mehr wird wie's war

ich will´ was erleben

Und jetzt geh ich
Alles ist geil, doch ich versteh's nicht

Damit du auch mal begreifst, das du mich einengst

Und wenn ich mein Ding mach´, verdrehst du deine Augen
Ich will´ auch mit meinen Kumpels mal raus
Ich kann dich nicht 24 Stunden lang kraulen
Wenn ich mal draußen bin, und meine Runden mach´
Schickst du mir SMS´s im Sekundentakt
Rufst mich an, ich soll dich in den Schlaf reden?
Du willst oft streiten, doch nie nachgeben
Mit deinen Eltern essen gehen ist nicht mein Job
Ich hab da noch sowas zu tun, du sagst bleib doch! Kein Bock!

Tut mir leid, ich streng dich an, du hast sowas nicht verdient
Wenn ich weg bin merk ich, ich bin sowas von verliebt
Und bin froh das es dich gibt

Someday I know I'll make it happen, someday
I try, yes I am trying
but I'm more afraid of living than I ever was of dying

Am I what I am I am I am lonely I am lost
searching for a reason no matter what it costs
I need to believe is this all there is to me

Someday x7

Bloody wounds make old scars
no-one said it would be easy, does it have to be so hard
Someday, someday, 
someday something good is gonna happen, someday
I try, yes I am trying
but I'm more afraid of giving than I ever was of loving

Am I what I am I am I am lonely I am lost
searching for a reason no matter what it costs
I need to believe is this all there is to me

no more reason to be shy
no more pain to hold inside
no more fear, no more blame
no more need to compromise

tired of this middle-ground and so ashamed to show my face
Someday, someday
Someday I know I'll make it happen, someday

Ké,"Is this our last chance to say all we have to say
hiding here inside ourselves we live our lives afraid
so close your eyes and just believe in everything your told
'cause in this land of great confusion it's easy to give up control

Strange world people talk and tell only lies
Strange world people kill an eye for an eye
Strange world dream one-day we'll see the light
Strange world believe and everything will be alright

And this is the place where everything begins and ends again
no secrets left to find no seven deadly sins
this world that we have wasted has kept us very well
when science now is sacred who will save us from ourselves

Strange world people kill still no-one hears their cries

Okay I’m young and I’m tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
In this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I’m on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin’ on medication, no I wont need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I’m young and I’m handsome
I say I’m filthy fucking rich, so I’m an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou’ and think it's time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I’m here to share it
No it’s not a problem, better get it, then I wont be here tomorrow momma

I don’t need you or your brand new Benz

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn’t forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he’ll remember
If not he’s human, I’m human, you human, we’ll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can’t see how momma hates him
He’s such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I’m only eight, I’m not old enough, guess it’s complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don’t get negated
I was gon’ save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but it's the 1980?s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin'’ Irish Baileys
She say “Stacks, you’re true blue?”
I said “Nah, I’m Navy”
I call her Kesha, she like it, because it’s hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I’m good to her

Do you know what to do wit me?
Bad bitches, I got two of me
Well you better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me so don’t bother introducing me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I’m super clean
I’m hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I’m ballin’, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin’, I’m just here, couldn’t catch you when I catch you
Bitch my swagger super natural
Get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I’m an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paint ballin’ out the frame, stuntin’ like a fool

And some vans and my mans got the ratchet
While I’m laying in some pussy you be laying in a casket
And I’m just saying, I’m just spazzing
I'm just smashing, I'm just nasty
If you ’bout it, bust it open

Catch a tantrum, know a girl called Cleopatra

Or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession,
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley,
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping,
Hit my head against the walls

What you've got boy is hard to find
Think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love

Won't listen to any advice,
Mama's telling me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted its a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy,
My judgment is getting kinda hazy
My status is gonna be affected if
I keep it up like a love sick crackhead

What you've got boy is hard to find
Think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you are away

So I got a question
Do you want to have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, your drug?
(Huh) your drug? (huh) your drug?
(Huh) your drug?
Is my love, your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love, is my drug

Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart and of course she go hard
Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell em that you love em, I say, 'take it off', 'take it off'

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums

So while you're here in my arms

Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cuz money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and raging
Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms

And if you don't, man, whatcha gonna say?

Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh huh)
We'll keep dancing 'till we die

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before

And my heart was heavy as stone
Hard as I was trying
I never could find, find my way home

And your voice came out of nowhere
Be my friend and give me your hand
Let's take off together
And then we can live wherever we land

Something in me was broken
And my thoughts were bitter and ill
My world was blown open
And I couldn't see and I couldn't feel
You said be yourself and think of me
And you'll know there's nothing to fear
Let's make plans together
It's time to move on and get out of here

Girl I need you
Don't know what I would do
Will you see the story through
It's a cruel world
And I need somewhere to hide
But time goes by
And your still on my side

Something in me was sinking
Cause my heart was heavy as stone
I gave up with thinking
I never would find, find my way home
And your voice came out of nowhere
Be my friend and give me your hand
Let's take off together
And then we can live wherever we land

Don't know what I would do
Will you see the story through

Turning over
Running round in circles
And I've worn myself out
Hoping that we'll always be together
Yeah we'll always be together[4x]

Keane,"Ya chewed me up and ya spat me out
The foolish boy that I am
So I chose to wander around and around
And make myself a man

I thought the world could be changed by
A good song and smile
But its been this way such a long time
So maybe I'm wrong

so long ago it must be
You're still the one that's troubling me
And still so far, so far away
I sat with a tear in my hand on a day so long ago

inside I am an ogre
With the simple thoughts of a child
I say what I think and I need to be loved
But I guess that's not your style

so long ago it must be
That you're still the one that's troubling me
And still so far, so far away
I sat with a tear in my hand on a day so long ago

I only see my dreams

Cold like some
Magnificent skyline
Out of my reach

Tied up to the ground

Keane,"Was it all in real time
Or was it just in my mind
Or was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage
Until I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room

Give me something to dream
Give me half of your bitterest pill
Something from under the surface
You actually feel

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies

The lightest words are heavy
And promises are easy
And no one's ever happy or sad for very long
But just because I said it
It doesn't mean I meant it
I guess that was the way all along

I'm just shaping the sound
I'm just turning the syllables round
Dipping my toe in the water
And watching you drown

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same
It was in your eyes, in your eyes
They were just easy lies

And it's been a long time waiting
And it's been a lifetime in the making

We said when you are alone and afraid
I will come to your aid
Was it just a dream, just a dream
Or was it real to me

We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same to me
Say these words again and again
And again and again",Again and Again

Is this
What you dreamed of?

To the window
Through the paper

I wish that I'd done

You can hang your hopes
On the bedsits masses
You can put your faith
In the foreign

You can do your best

Better than this

Get a grip on yourself
Get a grip on yourself
Could have been something
But you're too late
And you
Wouldn't want it anyway

Just a photograph
From the wrong time
'Cause there
Is no soap star
Holding your hand
You can see yourself
In a freeze-frame
Must be someone else
Using your name

And everyone
Will be the same
And everyone will glow
And everywhere
You'll see your name
In every shop window

In the cellars of the sea
And disappear in them

Its unrelenting appetite
For feeding off the weak
Who never had their time to speak

The sky will be my shroud
A monumental cloud

If we could turn back, you can't paper over the crack
But it will return now, and your heart will burn black

Give me your hand
Cut the skin, let me in
The molecules of us
Bleeding into one again

The sky will be my shroud
The cenotaph of cloud

If we could turn back, you can't paper over the crack
But it will return now, and your heart will burn black
Forgotten my way home, forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start, and it burns my heart
I know

Everything you said was right, and I suppose
Everything is here forever, till it goes
You gave it all away, kept nothing for yourself
Just a picture on the shelf

Burning up now
And I'm racing down a road I don't recognize
I realize I've

Forgotten my way home, forgotten everything that I know
Every day a false start, and it burns my heart
Turn black",Black Burning Heart
Keane,"Singing a song with your feet on the dashboard
The cigarette streaming into the night
These are the things that I want to remember
I want to remember you by

It won't come again
'Cause love is the end
Oh no, my friend
Love is the end

I took off my clothes and I ran to the ocean
Looking for somewhere to start anew
And when I was drowning in that lonely water
All I could think of was you

Whoa, my friend
Love is the end
So lets not pretend
'Cause love is the end

Take it back, don't let it die
Or raise again the fallen night
'Cause I still do, depend on you
So don't say those words, you wrung me through

Whoa, oh oh
Love is the end
So lets not pretend
'Cause love is the end

So I tread the only road
The only road I know
Nowhere to go, but home
Nowhere to go

But still you can't look back
But all the principles of love
Don't save us
Don't save us",Love Is the End
Keane,"I dreamed I was drowning
In the river Thames
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin

I dreamed I was drifting
On the howling wind
I dreamed I had nothing at all
Nothing but my own skin

Slipped away from your open hand
Into the river
Saw your face looking back at me
I saw my past
And I saw my future

[Chorus]
You take the pieces of the dreams that you have
Cause you don't like the way they seem to be going
You cut them up and spread them out on the floor
You're full of hope as you begin rearranging
Put it all back together
But anyway you look at things and try
The lovers are losing

I dreamed I was watching
A young lover's dance
I reached out to touch your hand
But I was watching from a distance

We cling to love like a skidding car
Clinched to the corner
I try to hold on to what we are
The more I squeeze the quicker we all are

I dreamed I had nothing at all (nothing but my own skin) [Repeat: x3]

Keane,"I shake through the wreckage for signs of life
Scrolling through the paragraphs
Clicking through the photographs

I wish I could make sense of what we do
Burning down the capitols
The wisest of the animals

Who are you, what are you living for
Tooth for tooth, maybe we'll go one more

This life, is lived in perfect symmetry
What I do, that will be done to me

Read page after page of analysis
Looking for the final score
We're no closer than we were before

Who are you, what are you fighting for
Holy truth? Brother I choose this mortal life
Lived in perfect symmetry

What I do, that will be done to me
As the needle, slips into the run out groove
Love, maybe you feel it too

And maybe you find, life is unkind
And over so soon
There is no golden gate
There's no heaven waiting for you

Oh boy you ought to leave this town
Get out while you can, the meter's running out
The voices in the streets you love
Everything is better when you hear that sound

Spineless dreamers, hide in churches
Pieces of pieces of rush hour, buses
I dream in emails, worn out phrases
Mile after mile of just empty pages

Wrap yourself around me
Wrap yourself around me

As the needle, slips into the run out groove
Maybe I'll feel it too
Maybe you'll feel it too
Maybe you'll feel it too (Spineless dreamers)
Maybe you'll feel it too (hide in churches)

Keane,"At the start of the news day, the fires begin
In words and in pictures, but I'm not listening
I'm not taking it in
I'm going to go to the country, where nothing goes on
Going to bury my head, where I can't hear the sound of bombs
Playing along

Me, I'm just playing along
You and I, so many good people all
Just playing along

I'm going to go to a bar, where is the jukebox is on
Going to shut out the noise, with a rock'n'roll song
Playing along

I'm going to turn up the volume [Repeat: x3]
Till I can't even think

Tell us a tale of the proud and the free
Sing us a swing time American melody
From ""Follow The Fleet""

Me, I'm just playing along
You and I, a billion people all
Just playing along

Keane,"We are just the monkeys, who fell out of the trees
We are blisters on the earth
We are not the flowers, we're the strangling weeds
In the meadow

And love is just our way of looking out for ourselves
When we don't want to live alone
So step into the vacuum, tear off your clothes
And be born again

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's no one looking on
Forget about fashion
Forget about the law
Pretend that you're alone now

I wonder what I'd do, if I could wake up every morning
With a clean slate
I'd burn through the cities, I'd tear through the towns
'Cos there's no deals to make
So break out of the cages, the delicate structures
We cling to all our lives
'Cos we are just the monkeys, who fell out of the trees
When we were trying to fly

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just primal desire
No right and no wrong
Forget about the future
Forget about blame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

She's not waiting for tomorrow
And she has no love in her eyes
Oh no, I wanna come down right now
But oh no, I wanna get out right now

Oh oh!

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's no one looking on
Forget about religion
Forget about shame
Pretend that you're alone now

No numbers in your phone now
There's nothing going on
Just primal desire
No right and no wrong
Forget about fashion
Forget about fame

Over the downtown and the avenues
Where the streets are wide
And the people thrive

I've never seen such clear skies
I've never seen such high hopes
I've never seen such tired eyes

And I wish that I could be
Everything you are

Down in the delta
The city wakes
Turns on the TV
As the levy breaks
Where the streets are burnt
By the summer sun
And there's nowhere to run to
When your time has come

I've never seen such beauty
I've never seen such clear skies
I've never seen such high hopes
I've never seen such tired eyes

Ah loops up piece by piece
Sunlight's watching over me
Take my pills on a winter sleep
I send myself to sleep

With what you nearly had and what you want
You fall asleep and then the moment's gone
So open your eyes and

Yeah, its hard to undo time
Hard to separate my past from my rhyme
Cause how could you separate milk from lime
Waste my time

Looking back
You always seem to be looking back (looking back)
Feels like your mind's always somewhere else
You're always looking over your shoulder

Think about the places you could never be
Beauty in the faces that you never see

How the moment flies

Yeah, they say life makes sense backwards
But you've got to live it forward

Am I the only one trying to fight off an army
Of memories dressed up all trying to harm me
I feel cocky, running up the steps like Rocky
Until the past comes flashing like paparazzi
Nothing's new so why open my folder
My favorite view is over my shoulder
Everything backwards, is my plight
Its landing first when in my flight
Even my tears run up my cheeks
Back in my eye

I'll shine a light on you, shine a light

Feel I'm floating high above me
Like I'm looking down upon me
Start sinking, every time I get to thinking
It's easier to keep on moving
Never stop to let the truth in

Sometimes I feel like it's all been done
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one
Sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done
I'm too tired to fight and yet too scared to run

And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe

I feel like a thief who has no faith
Maybe more than by the grade
Of the drugs he took that day

Sinking, in the pain he's been inflicting
Yet he's feeling like the victim
Just a horoscope's to blame

Sometimes I feel like a little lost child
Sometimes I feel like the chosen one
Sometimes I wanna shout out 'til everything goes quiet
Sometimes I wonder why I was ever born

And if I stop for a minute
I think about things I really don't wanna know
And I'm the first to admit it
Without you I'm child
And so wherever you go, I will follow

Ugh, yeah
And baby you are just beautiful
From crown to your cuticles
You held down with two sons
You never frown when duty calls
You know me, I gave you more than you can handle
But you still keep a handle on it
Even when I take something beautiful and vandal on it
No more females
Well how come my emails got notes on a scandal
It's like Eve with the apple
A priest in a chapel
Overcome by the devil's tackle
I'm still shackled in the battle
I know, I'm such a hassle
Every time I let me thoughts go
I get baffled
So I hardly pause
I just crossed z's with these gnarly broads
Cause it hurts me just to see what I finally lost
So I guess I'm just a fiend
Consumed by the scene
The stage and the screen where it's just me and Keane

Go back and look for you
But it's a heartless drug
I'm addicted to

And when I drive that road
And start to feel that chill
I think I see your face
Do you come here still?

Those were the times and these were the places
Your love was so good
And now that I'm here I suddenly find that
I'm tumbling backward

And back to where I was before
Dreaming of glory and your love
And now I'm lying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love

The chemicals react
The molecules collide
The poison works it's way
Somewhere down inside

When we were young
I really believed love would never leave us
But time has a knack of pulling the rug out from underneath us

And nothing matters anymore
I'm still a victim of your love
And now I'm banging on your door
Tumbling backwards with your love
Over and over with your love

I know they're only ghosts and memories that I'm clutching on
And maybe I'm reaching back for something I never had
Still it seems so real to me
These ragged threads that lead me back to you

(Losing my mind waiting for you)

And back to where I was before
Tumbling backwards with your love
And now I'm lying on your floor
Crashed on the surface of your love

Where the other dreams we had,
Fractured and frozen with your love
You put a spell upon me there
To never be broken with your love

Nowhere to run to but your love
Over and over with your love",Your Love
Keane,"It's time to make a start  
To get to know your heart  
Time to show your face  
Time to take your place  
 
In every speck of dust  
In every universe  
When you feel most alone  
You will not be alone  
 
Just shine a light on me  
Shine a light  
I'll shine a light on you  
Shine a light  
 
And you will see my shadow  
On every wall  
And you will see my footprints  
On every floor  
 
It only takes a spark  
To tear the world apart  
These tiny little things  
That make it all begin  
 
Just shine a light on me  
Shine a light  
I'll shine a light on you  
Shine a light  
 
And you will see my shadow  
On every wall  
And you will see my reflection  
In your freefall  
 
Just shine a light on me  
Shine a light  
I'll shine a light on you  
Shine a light  
 
Cuz when your back's against the wall  
That's when you show no fear at all  
And when you're running out of time  
That's when you hitch your star to mine  
 
We won't be leaving by the same road

Keane,"I open my eyes, everything shines
I swim as the breeze blows down the coast
Down on my luck, breathing my last
Dirty old hands carry me home

Red sky turning round
Black rain falling down
If you've got love
You better hope that that's enough
Sandstorm cuts your skin
Black clouds circling
If you've got love
You better hope that that's enough

You came from the south
To Lebanon shores
Folding our clothes,
Dived in too deep
The blackest of seas glittering red
Lit by the fire over our heads

Red sky turning round
Black rain falling down

You better hope that that's enough

Some days set your world on fire
And some days they sink like stones

That's when your heart will cry out
Until your body is numb
And the night will try to tempt you
But the day will come

We dream hard, we shoot high
Sometimes our fingers graze the sky
But we can't hold on

Some days set your world on fire
And some days they sink like stones

It's when your heart will cry out
Until your body is numb
And the night will try to tempt you
But the day will come
Brother don't hang your head
Until your distance is run
'Cause though it seems so far away
You know the day will come

Keane,"Somethings crept in under our door
Silence soaking through the floor
Pinching like a stone in my shoe
Some chemical that's breaking down the glue
That's been biding me to you

Ooh, I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been wrong so many times
We walk in circles, the blind leading the blind

Well I thought that love watched over this house
But you're boarding up the windows now
We've been leaning on each other so hard
Tied so tight we wound up miles apart
Making simple things so hard

Ooh, I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles, the blind leading the blind
We've been disconnected somehow
There's an invisible wall between us now
But I've been wrong and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles the blind leading the blind

I see the landscape change before my eyes
The features I've been navigating by
No nothing looks the way it did before
I don't know where to look, or what to look for

I feel like I just don't know you anymore
But I've been burned and I've been down so many times
We walk in circles, the blind leading the blind
We've been disconnected somehow

In your own time
There's no map to guide our way
So I say nothing, you say nothing
In your own way
Thought I could help you find your place

But that girl she wheeled you in
This time was never good enough
'Cause she was gone and seen everything
And if you ever spoke of love
She just smiled and put you down
'Cause she was making all the plans
She had a vision of light and sound

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And everything that we've been dreaming of making real one day
So save your money pack your bags
We better run before we disappear
She took the train into the city but you're still here

You hear a song that takes you back
The song long for God tonight
And friends who said they hang your back
But they just turned them round and let you fight
And on the bowling alley wall
You used all your smartest minds
But they'll be painted over now
Looks like here gonna get left behind

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And all the things that we've been dreaming of making real one day
So save your money, pack your bags
I wanna run with you on Stamford hill
She took the train into the city but you stood still

You stood still about the train
You knew as you watched her go
That she wan never coming back
And start to places that you know
You said you're scared if I
And that didn't want to go
Where everyone else goes

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And everything that we've been dreaming of making real one day

Keane,"Have you been feeling that pull?
And are you hearing that call?
'Cause you've got everything that you need to make a start

I had a dream of my own
Just walking out of my home
And going I don't know where to sing beneath the stars

Your whole life lies ahead
It's just around the bend

So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road

When the world's laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load?
When things get bad you know you have a friend
All along the road

And I would love it sometime
If you would walk at my side
Going I don't know where to sing beneath the stars

If in your life you need a hand
Reaching the promised land

So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road

Rolls a stone it's rolling me

I missed my turn
In the dark I hear your voice
It makes things easy
I’ve strayed too far from the road
Where she could always make things easy
And I won't fight through the rising tide

Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

I lie in the dark, I feel I'm falling
Feel your hand on my back, hear your voice calling
I'm out of my depth girl, stick close to me
Because the people in this town, they look straight through me

We were silenced by the night
But you and I, we're gonna rise again
Divided from the light
I wanna love the way we used to then

Keane,"I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane and the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns

I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade and watch night
Coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign but you still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day
Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade and watch night
Coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drums and the lovers appear to take turns
As the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

I wheel my bike off the train, up the north trade road
And look for you on marley lane in every building and every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from the road

But you've got nothing to hide, you come to change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy but you won't go far

After the things I've done
You fear for what we have become
The ground is uneven
We stumble from day to day
You shelter where it's easy
Although your feet are like lead
But you gotta get underway

Drag your heart up to the starting line
Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time
It's too easy to get left behind
I know you've been kicked around
But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me

Each heart is a paper kite blown around by the breeze
Love won't rest 'til it brings you to your knees

I see you in the supermarket line
I see you silhouetted on a wall

This vessel of Balsa wood
Is the fag end tail of amoeba-hood
The busying cast confer
And get their taste of the drama

You stare through mindless daytime shows
And curse yourself for growing old
The sterile scent of shaving foam
Reminds you of another world

I see you in the roofless sombre sky
I see you when the lovers stop outside
I see you silhouetted on a wall
But I don’t see myself there at all

I see you in the sweetness of our child
I see you in the supermarket aisle
I see you when I’m kneeling on the floor
But I can’t see myself anymore

And end up on the couch by myself, no

With no home cooked meal

And I ain't tryna be calling your name wondering where you at
'Cause I know that you ain't upstairs
I ain't tryna be wrecking my brain
Going back and forth thinking 'bout how I gotta change

This ain't no game 'cause I ain't playing girl
It's you and me girl, that's how we be girl
And I'm gone change
And I'm for real girl, can't do without ya girl

We're gonna find one
One that really screams
I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little
Of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere
In sight

Oohh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Oohh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights

A day, so pretty
As the one I see today
These same old eyes
Are seeing
The same thing
In a different way

I thought I saw
The sky start talking
She was whispering, inside
My ear
I did not know what the sky
Was saying
But the message was clear

You can see me
You can hear me
When I touch you
You can feel me
I am looking
In your mirror
And I see myself in you

I thought I heard
The sun start laughing
As she hid behind
A cloud
She handed me a gift
A rainbow

Keb' Mo',"Something within me, something within me
I cannot explain
All that I know, there is something within

Somebody's talkin' to me
I wonder what they're tryin' to say
Maybe they're listening to me
While I'm drivin' my Chevrolet
I got off the highway
Headed for the mountain top
Tryin' to find somethin', tryin' to find somethin'

Something within me, that holdeth the rain
Something within me, that banishes all the pain
Something within me, that I cannot explain
All that I know, there is something within

It was everywhere
In the air and the land and the sea

Exactly who was talking to me

It wouldn't run so deep

Are you willing
To walk through the fire with me

And see how deep we can love
How high we can climb
And if we burn down
The walls of our fears
There'll be nothin' left
But a whole lotta love in here

To walk through the fire
Face down the wind and rain
Who knows how far we can go

Keb' Mo',"I was afraid to get out of the car
So I just sat there, I just sat there
How was I gonna tell them
That I'd lost my job
I gotta go in there
I'm going in there

So we gathered 'round the table
And I told them the news
But the looks of desperation
Nearly broke me in two

Son, I know you wanted
Them running shoes
They're gonna have to wait
They're gonna have to wait
And darlin' I know you wanted
That dress in the window
We're gonna get it
It just won't be now

Then my little girl looked up at me
With those big round eyes
And the words that she told me
Almost made me cry

(She said) we don't need it
We can do without it
We're gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're gonna stick together
Make it better
We don't need it

My son said, Daddy
I got sixteen dollars
I want you to take it
I want you to take it
The next door neighbor
Asked me to rake the leaves
And I'm gonna do it
I'm sure gonna do it

'Cause I wanna help you out
Any way I can
It's about time
That I learned to be a man

My wife said, darlin'
We've got all this stuff
Just sittin' there
Just sittin' there
Like grandma's china
And her sterling silverware
It's just sitting there, gathering dust

Ever since she passed away
We ain't used it yet
So let's put it out in the front yard
See what we can get

We can do without it

We're gonna stick together

Days and weeks and months went by
The big boss called in the nick of time
I got my check and I brought it home
Yeah it's been tough but we've been blessed
We're gonna get them shoes
And that brand new dress (but you know)

Keco Brandão,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful
Keco Brandão,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Keedy,"Now I lay me down to sleep 
Pray for your love to keep 
If you should leave before the dawn remember this 
while  you are gone

Sometimes I feel like your swinging door
Wth you walking in and out and in and out 
I've never been in so before and then I'd have to do without you


Guess I thought i could be strong 
Guess I could not wait too long 
Guess you just can't do no wrong 
So baby could you
 
Chorus 
Save some of your love for me 
Save some love for me 
Cause you know I need your love baby 

The day and week and season change  
And then you slip back into my world 
I hate the thought it sounds so strange 
But I, I want to be your number ne girl

Heaven helpme to let you go 
Heaven help me to tell you no 
Heaven help me I love you so 
So baby could you 

Chorus 

Oh baby save your love 
I need you wrong or right 
Under the stars above 
I'm wishing every night 
What can I give to you 
So that you have to see 
So that you wil be true 
And save your love for me

And saw it through without exemption

Each careful step along the byway

I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn`t know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

You've begun to slip away into where, nobody knows""

Never met a nigga done with playin’

Show me your soul and I'll mould it

Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Keiko Lee,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Keiko Matsui,"""How ya doin' girls? Long time, no see.
Listen, I've been to the doctor lately.
Honey, I just spent forty dollars to hear that from that guy?""

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
The way he described it he said,
""You'd be better off dead than alive.""
I didn't listen to his jive.
I knew all along he was all wrong,
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
He said I need treatment.
But I'm not that easily led.
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind.
And he thought I was nuts.
No more if's or and's or but's.
Oh, no.

They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas.
But I knew what was happenin',
I knew I was a genius.
What's so strange when you know that
You're a wizard at three?
I said, ""Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me.""

I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.
But I had saw some crazy things
Before I came to.
Now, do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.

They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,
They all laughed at Edison,
And also at Einstein.
So why should I feel sorry if they just
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic
That went on in my head.
I had a brain, it was insane.
So I just let them laugh at me
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top.
Aaaaaaah.

""Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?""
Ba, ba, ba, ba!
""Oh, here she comes again.""
Badada, badada, badada. Wo!

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
But I said, ""Doctor,
I think that it's you instead.
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.
And you know two heads are better than one.""

Man schaltet alle Ampeln auf grün

Nur - außer Kleingeld gibt das nichts her

Und do brauchst deine Bibel nicht mehr
Das wunde Thema - bitte schneid es nicht an

You and I could never see
So as we kiss goodbye
If I cry don't let these
Tears I shed today
Hold you back in any way
He's waiting for your smile so hurry
I'll be fine now don't you worry
Ain't gonna lie
If you say he's the guy
I won't stand in your way
Though it hurts me today
I'll get by
And I ain't gonna lie

Baby don't cry
Though my heart is breaking
I'm glad that you
Told the truth
Instead of some
Pack of lies
To us a lie's the only sin
At least we'll end the way we've been
By being truthful to each other
Girl I hope I find another
Ain't gonna lie
I'll be out by and by
Maybe I'll never meet
Anyone half as sweet
But I'll try
And I ain't gonna lie

Is it just that you can't face the future with me, can't you tell me to my face 
You just took the cowards way to say good-bye, how would you feel here in my place?

No bolt will be colder the shoulder

Keith & Kristyn Getty,"In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.",In Christ Alone
Keith Anderson,"My brothers got a black and white picture 
With number across his chest
He'll do 15 more years if his behavior stays at its best
He took the blame to save his best friends name at a job that went bad down in Birmingham
Yeah but he don't mind that orange suit because he knows the clothes don't make the man

Two sails down from where my brother lays his head 
The walls echo Amazing Grace and quotes of scriptures that man once read
When he prayed upon the little souls of all those boys that did not understand
That you can wear a robe that's laced with gold but the clothes don't make the man

Designer names, rips and stains shouldn't tell you who I am 
Because sometimes angles hide their wings and the devil's dressed like a lamb
Yeah the clothes don't make the man

They all laughed and called him names when he said that he was sent to be their King
You don't even own a home, you got several clothes and sandals on your feet

Stripped of his pride he was crucified on a cross with nails of hatred in his hands
But he rose from the grave in three days 
Yeah the clothes don't make the man

Designer names rips and stains shouldn't tell you who I am 
Because some times angles hide their wings and the devils dressed like a lamb
Yeah the clothes don't make the man

Keith Anderson,"Fin'lly got over that song of ours; stopped chasin' little red sports cars,
To check the license plates an' I quit drivin' by your place.
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts Honky Tonks, restaurants.
An' seein' some of our old friends it feels good to dance again.
An' I can fin'lly smell your perfume an' not look around the room for you.
An' I can walk right by your picture in a frame an' not feel a thing.

I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky.
An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes.
An' nothin's changed, an' we're still same.
An' I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss,
An' I'm hangin' on to every word rollin' off of your lips
An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place,
Everytime I hear your name.

Got someone special in my life everyone thinks she'd make a great wife.
Dad says he thinks she's the one reminds him of Mom when she was young,
But it's way too soon to be talkin 'bout rings; don't wanna rush into anything.
She's getting over someone too, kinda like me an' you.
An' she talks about him every once in a while, an' I just nod my head an' smile,
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through yeah, I've been there too.

An' when the conversation turns to you,
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me"",
Kinda thought, an' your face is all that I see.
I know I can't go back when I still go back.
An' there we are, parked down by the riverside,
An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time,
An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place,
Every time I hear your name.

So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid.
(Every time I hear your name.)
Stop tryin' the change the things I can't change.

Keith Anderson,"Same Saturday night, same ol' crowd
Draggin' Main to the Safeway then turn back around
'Til curfew and then head down to the river's edge and get drunk
Ain't nothing new what else you gonna do out in Podunk

Well I knew this six-string was my ticket out
No flashin' red light was gonna slow me down
18 years old everything that I owned in the back of that truck
I put a dip in my mouth and I headed straight out outta Podunk

1st Chorus:
Goodgye, daddy looked me in the eye said go where you gotta go
But don't forget to call home
And momma cried keep Jesus in your life and I hugged her one last time
And then I headed down the roadin a dusty cloud of smoke
Out of Podunk

Bridge:
A lot of years gone by showin' on my face
Nothing in this life that time hasn't changed
I chased a lot of dreams and some of them came true
Ain't it funny how the very place I ran from is the place I'm runnin' to

Another Saturday night singin' to the same ol' crowd
Still playin this six-string but things are different nowI met one
Of those girls turn your whole world around girls
And wouldn't you know it
We got our eyes on a house 'bout a hundred miles south
Out in Podunk


Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried said keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own
Out in Podunk

Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried said keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own

Well, I started back-steppin', stumblin', stutterin',
Tellin' her where I'd been an' how she was just a friend.
She said: ""You know I know that ain't the truth,

Just awaiting to be turned back on 
And ill crank em up and sing along
Sickened that your gone so go ahead

I know I can take it now,
Don't wait any longer it'll make me stronger
Break my heart, get it over with
Get on with your goodbye kiss
Girl its now or never 
Cause its the last time you'll ever break my heart
You break my heart

That little blond down at the club
The one your so jealous of
Well late last night she called me up 
And heard we're breaking up
Its what you want, bring it on

And my buddies that you hated
They knew we wouldn't make it
So there takin' me to Vegas
And I hate to keep em waiting

I got diesel on my sleeze bend
Plowin' up a cloud of dust
I just called my buddy Steve
He's been haulin' here from dawn 'til dust

And cotton pickin' Ricky said
He's ready for a cold beer

Back breakin', head achin' all week long

We gotta get it 'fore the gettin's gone

A little bit'll getcha lit up
And the twins are here from school
Lookin' good in their six inch pumps

Tommy's tanked up
Spittin' game like an oceaner
And that rockin' little red head whispered in my ear
Let's go off into the river bed and get outta here

Keith Anderson,"Closest I've ever been to meeting Jesus was when
Me and Bobby Penson put up our pink slips on Blue Hole road
Me needle's showing ninety, I flew right by him
Lightning fast until I had a bad Goodyear blow
That old Chevy rolled and rolled and I know
Heaven must have heard the words beneath my breath
And I thank God, I ain't there yet

That's the closest I've ever been
To never seeing my momma again
Found out quick how precious life is
Drive my new truck a little slower than I did 
That's the smallest I've ever felt
That's the furtherest I've ever fell
Not too far to find out how life ends
That's the closest I ever been

Closest I've ever been
To being the devil's friend was when
Shelly gave into me and him
Down by the river
I gave her my heart and my jacket
I still ain't got 'em back yet
She left me hurt, searching for love, liquor, whatever
Quicker than I could say sin
I slipped further in than I was planning
Never shook the devil's hand
But I drank his whiskey and I loved his women

That's the closest I've ever been
To telling God ""to hell with him""
Go down in flames and laying the blame
Why would he ever let her walk away
That's the smallest I've ever felt
That's the furthest I've ever fell
Not too far for God to forgive
I thank God
That's the closest I've ever been

Got it all behind me
And every day I'm finding
Another way to be the best man I can
And I'm the closest I ever been
Closest I've ever been
Closest I've ever been",Closest I've Ever Been

There was a time, so many times
I caused her pain
I saw her cry
But I closed my eyes

Keith Anderson,"I see your momma and the candles and the tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the aisle
Feel my knees start to tremble
As I tell the preacher ""Don't you look beautiful tonight""

All the wonderful words in my head I've been thinking
You know I want to say them all just right
I lift your veil and angels start singing
Such a heavenly sight, yeah

[Chorus:]
Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
By feelings so absolute
There's no doubt
Sealing your love with a kiss
Waited my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you

I smell the jasmine floating thorough the air like a love song
Watch my words, draw sweet tears from your eyes
Bow our heads as the preacher talks to Jesus
He's blessed this brand new life

Keith Anderson,"I remember summer,
1993 she was tall and blond and tan
And man she was all in love with me
She started talkin' about our future 
And it scared me half to death
So I ran away 
But to this day
Her memory takes my breathe

Should of seen her smile
Should of heard her laugh 
And oh the way her eyes would dance
When she brushed her hair back

[Chorus]
She could've of been mine
She would've of been in another place and time
But now and then, I go there in my mind
Wish it would of been
She should've been 
She could've been, mine

Home for the holidays
A friends party, new years eve
I turned around and found a familiar
Blue eye starring back at me
A little girl came running up
I took her bay the hand
A memory in miniature said, ""Mommy who's that man""

Should've seen her little smile
Should've heard her little laugh
Oh the way her eyes just danced
When she brushed her hair back

Somebody needs a hug
A little a personal attention,
Some good ol' loving and affection
Yeah, I'm talkin' full body good Lord Almighty
C'mon and get you some
You need to be wrapped up
Snug as a bug in a rug
A big ol' teddy bear squeeze where you can barely breathe
Somebody needs a hug

Your still on the fence
Id be wise to disappear if I had any sense
But I don't, no obviously 
I think I can fix it

Keith Anderson,"She dresses up her children and she herds 'em to the car
Drives down to the mega church but can't find a place to park
Then she feels a little guilty when she takes His name in vain
So she folds her last two dollars and she drops 'em in the plate

It's Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

His back is out of kilter from sleeping on concrete
And he'd like to have some breakfast but he'd trade it for a drink
Those early morning joggers, they're quick to pass him by
And the ones who drop a dollar, don't dare look him in the eye

Another Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America
Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Smell the eggs and bacon, I hear the church bells ring
Cheerleaders shaking on a big screen TV
There's Winnebago's and boats on the lake
And a red-head freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake

It's Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

He's hunkered in a bunker with a rifle in his hand
Layin' his life on the line, every inch of sand
But he's dreaming about that freedom that he's been fighting for
And the arms that will wrap around him
When he comes walking through that door

Some Sunday morning, it's Sunday morning in America
Yeah, Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Smell the eggs and bacon, I hear the church bells ring
Cheerleaders shaking on a big screen TV
There's Winnebago's and boats on the lake

Yeah, Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America
Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America

Well, I know it ain't perfect
Ya, there's a lot of things wrong in America
But I thank God for those who lay down their lives
To make this place my home

Smell the eggs and bacon, I hear the church bells ring
Cheerleaders shaking on a 57 inch big screen TV
There's trucks on a highway and sailboats on the lake
And a red-head freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake

Oh, Sunday morning, Sunday morning in America, in America",Sunday Morning in America
Keith Barbour,"It's the morning soon he'll rise 
Find the glasses for his eyes 
Aren't what they used to be 
Picks up the clothes he's worn so long 
On the bureau sits the picture of a lady 
And the mural of a man who's been gone for many years 

[Chorus]
The old man walks in Echo Park 
From bench to bench he moves from morning â??til dark 
For the ducks some bread he brings 
Wonder if he'll feed them this time next spring 

Listening to the children play 
Reminds him of other days 
Many years ago 
Thoughts of a child that he helped grow 
And the memory of a letter saying dear sir 
We regret to inform you, your son will not be coming home

Old man tell me are there fears 
Do you measure life in years 
Or is one day all you'll ever know

with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy""

I'm coming down on heads with sour pain
I miss my smile, I miss my soulful swing

Ask for Mister Blue
I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night

Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Keith Copeland,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

And it's only that I care
I really only want just to see you there

Please try and overlook my, my human side
I know I'm such a bad example and you know I'm so full of pride

I really, really only just want to see you there

Keith Green,"You know I can't explain to you
Really how He does it

He lives in my heart
And that's the only proof
The only proof that I can give you
Cause He lives in my heart

Most people that knew me before
Didn't know that I could believe something so strong

To prove Himself

Before it's too late

And he shall say to the sheep come ye, blessed of my father,
Inherit the kingdom I have prepared for you from the foundation of the world,
For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat,
I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink,
I was naked, and you clothed me,

But now you've got them playin' your game (you creep)

He'll put an apple in your lyin' mouth
And cook you in a sulfer stew
One that'll never be through

Then I'd be down there cookin' too

Not to care if they come
You close your eyes,
And pretend the job is done

""oh, bless me, lord!
Bless me, lord!""
You know, it's all I ever hear!
No one aches,
No one hurts,
No one even sheds one tear
But, he cries,
He weeps,
He bleeds,
And he cares for your needs
And you just lay back,
And keep soaking it in

Oh, can't you see such sin?!
'cause he brings people to your door,
And you turn them away
As you smile and say,
""god bless you!
Be at peace!""
And all heaven just weep,
'cause Jesus came to your door,
You left him out on the streets

Open up! open up!
And give yourself away
You see the need,
You hear the cries,
So how can you delay?!
God is calling,
And you are the one
But like Jonah, you run
He told you to speak, 
But you keep holding it in

Oh, can't you see such sin?!
The world is sleeping in the dark, 
That the church just can't fight,
'cause it's asleep in the light!
How can you be so dead?!
When you've been so well famed
Jesus rose from the grave,
And you!
You can't even get out of bed!
Oh, Jesus rose from the dead!
Come on, get out of your bed!

How can you be so numb?!
Not to care if they come
You close your eyes,
And pretend the job is done!
You close your eyes,
And pretend the job is done!
Don't close your eyes,
Don't pretend the job is done

Come away! come away!
Come away with me, my love!
Come away from this mess,
Come away with me, my love!
Come away from this mess!
Come away with me, my love!
Come away,
Come away with me my love!",Asleep in the Light
Keith Green,"How can they live without jesus
How can live without god's love
How can they feel so at home down here
When there's so much more up above

Throwin' away things that matter
They hold on to things that don't
The world has gone crazy
But soon maybe
A lot more are gonna know

For maybe they don't understand it
Or maybe they just haven't heard
Or maybe we're not doin' all we can
Living up to his holy word

'cause phonies have come
And wrongs been done
Even killing in Jesus' name
And if you've been burned
Here's what I've learned
The lord's not the one to blame

For he's not just a religion
With steeples and bells
Or a salesman who will sell you
The things you just want to hear

For his love was such
That he suffered so much
To cause some of us
Just to follow, follow

So many laughing at Jesus
While the funniest thing that he's done
Is love this whole stubborn rebellious world
While their hate for him just goes on

And love just like that
Will bring him back
For the few he can call his friends
The ones he's found true
Who've made it through
Enduring until the end
The ones he's found true
Who've made it through
Enduring until the end",How Can They Live Without Jesus?
Keith Green,"As each day passes by,
I feel my love run dry.
I get so weary, worn,
And tossed around in the storm.
Well I'm blind to others needs,
And I'm tired of planting seeds.
I seem to have a wealth,
Of so many thoughts about myself.

I want to, I need to, be more like Jesus.
I want to, I need to, be more like him.

Our fathers will was done,
By giving us his son,
Who paid the highest cost,
To point us to the cross.
And when I think of him,
Taking on the whole worlds sin,
I take one look at me,
Compared to what I'm called to be.

I want to, I need to, be more like Jesus.
I want to, I need to, be more like him.

Remember, there's no greater love,
Then to lay down your life for a friend.
The end of all my prayers,
Is to care like my lord cares.
My one and only goal,
His image in my soul.
Yes my weakness is revealed,
When by his stripes I'm healed.
Hes faithful and hes true,
To complete the work he begins in you.",I Want to Be More Like Jesus
Keith Green,"When I was young I used to believe everything that I heard, just what I heard.
But now the only thing that I can believe is gods word, his holy word.
But even now my doubts will open up for me a world that I just despise.
And then the shades come down, the light turn off,
And I'm left alone with my helpless cries.
When I hear all his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.
If you believe and your faith just dies.
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up,
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.

I want to go around the world and prove Jesus lives, you know he lives.
And were not only friends, were family, were relatives, relatives.
But when I'm far from home and so alone, and my imagined fears get so over-sized.
That's when I listen to the one no one should listen to, and get fooled by his disguise.
Feeling weak from his lies, all of his bad wicked lies,
If you believe and your faith just dies.
Don't you get fooled, don't you even open up,
Or expose yourself to just one of his wicked lies.

If you're well read, you probably know how the story goes.
That wolf can look so good especially dressed in the right clothes, the wooly clothes.
And as he starts to knit the counterfeit hell totally make you feel like you're paralyzed.
Hell keep you spun around and looking down,
Just when you should be looking straight to the skies.
Pleading help from his lies, all of the devils wicked lies.
If you believe and your faith just dies.
Don't you be a fool, don't you even open up, or expose yourself,
To one of his wicked lies, to one of his wicked lies.",Lies

Keith Green,"I was done hoeing, out in the fields for the day,
I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.

I said, father, there's so much to know,
There's a world of things to see,
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself
If you give me what is mine,
I will go, if I can have your blessing,
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.

Son, I've always tried my best for you,
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of god.
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,
I met a traveling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,
He said, no, it isn't that bad.

And then a few days later, on an old city road,
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.

Then a famine hit and drained the land,
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was nowhere to find,
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.

I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,
I had to eat with the swine,
The bread I ate was like stone,
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.

Oh, the servants there are better fed,
If I could only have what my father gives them,
I would truly need nothing more.
Oh, I will go and say to him,
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them

It didn't take too long to pack my things,
I left with only what I wore,
And I prayed that I still had a home.

I was near home, in site of the house,
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,
I've learned that my home is right where you are,
Oh father, take me in.

Bring the best robe, put it on my son,
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,
This is my son who I thought had died,
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,
My son was dead and he's now alive,
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,
My son was dead,
My son was lost,
My son's returned in the hands of god.",You Are the One!

And death has triumphed
That's what they say
But tried to hold him in the tomb
The son of life
Rose on the third day

Just look
The gates of hell
They're falling
Crumbling from the inside out

He broke those hellish chains with a cry

See him bruise the serpent's head

I love you so
And I'm sorry you get angry when I say that
You just don't know

That there's a heaven waiting
For you and me
I know it seems every time we talk
I'm only tryin' to just make you see

And it's only that I care
I really only want
Just to see you there

Please try and overlook my
My human side
I know I'm such a bad example
And you know I'm so full of pride

But Jesus isn't like that
No He's perfect all the way
I guess that's why we need Him
Cause by ourselves, there's just no way

And it's only that I care
I really, really only want to see you there
Just to see you there

So now we'll just have to invite the small

And it's only that I care
I really, really only want
Just to see you there

Isn't that Joseph and Mary's son?
Well, did He grow up right here?

Keith Harkin,"Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense

There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
And it shines like the sun
At the end of the day we will give thanks
And pray to the One

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Fill my life with gladness
Take away my sadness

Keith Harkin,"Well you gassed her up
Behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night

And you got paid on Friday
And your pockets are jinglin'
And you see the lights
You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a 6
And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

Then you comb your hair
Shave your face
Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
All the other days
In the week you know that this'll be the Saturday
You're reachin' your peak

Stoppin' on the red
You're goin' on the green
'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
You've ever seen
And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Tell me is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumblin'
You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night

Well you gassed her up
And you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile
Barrellin' down the boulevard,
You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

Is the crack of the poolballs, neon buzzin?
Telephone's ringin'; it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye.

Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumblin'
Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumblin'
Stumblin onto the heart of Saturday night",The Heart of Saturday Night
Keith Harkin,"Sitting here I might make a wish
Patience is all I have
Each time I think I won't let you go

Moving patterns in the air
Thoughts that drown like Fred Astaire
Wanna hold your body, hold you close

And I just can't wait
To see your face
To say your name

When I hear your voice
And touch your skin
the whole world fades away

Hey, there's nothing but You and I
You take the stars, the moon, the night, the air I breathe
You're the only thing I needed

You, You came into my life
You opened up me eyes, my heart, my jealousy
You're the thing that matters most to me

There's nothing but You and I

People they will come and go
Another night another show
Another place to rest my weary head

Now I know I'm coming home
To you where I belong
You fall into my arms here once again

When I hear your voice
And touch your skin
the whole world fades away

Hey, there's nothing but You and I
You take the stars, the moon, the night, the air I breathe
You're the only thing I needed

You, You came into my life
You opened up me eyes, my heart, my jealousy
You're the thing that matters most to me

Keith Harkin,"So it goes history shows deserts must expand
Camels sail like wooden ships like women down The Strand
There's sand on Second Avenue and the wind blows like a train
Taxi's line-up like a strand of pearls around the block again

I remembered everything every windowpane
Every word came back to me the way it used to be
Then I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

There's a bus that leaves at eight fifteen and another one at ten
Should I climb aboardrisk everything-and ride it to the end?
Watch the hill like roller coasters up into the sky
And wish that you were here by me so close that I could die

You say love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you last night and I am still alive
'Til I saw your face across the street
Through the tears of Hercules

You say love wrecks everything and none of us survive
But I got over you last night and I am still alive
'Til I saw your face across the street

Keith Harling,"No two ways about this
I'd be a fool to doubt this feelin
I've got about her
I see drivin downtown
When she rolls the window down
Yeah, I'm downright sure
Chorus:
I love what I see
Every time I see her lookin at me
Over here over there
Any ol where we might happen to meet
I can't account for the how's or the why's
All I know's I can believe my eyes
And I love what I see
Every time I see her lookin at me
Just last night at the football game
When she walked by she said my name
Oh imagine that
Don't know that I'd call it flirtin
That us'ly implies uncertainty
And I can say for a fact
Repeat Chorus:
",I Love What I See
Keith Harling,"It's four o'clock all my work is done
I could go home early for a little fun
They say surprise adds a little spice
To an ordinary story book life
I looked down the hall
And I saw the end
The shadow on the wall of another man

[Chorus]
Tell me, who's been sleepin' in papa bear's bed
Who's been lovin' my baby instead of me
I can't see
Tell me, who's been sittin' in my favorite chair
Rockin' my baby while I'm not there
Tell me when
Did the fairy tale end
And who's been sleepin' in papa bear's bed

One's too hot, one's too cold
Two's just right, so I'm gonna go
Turn the page, it's time to move on
Whatever we had has already gone
And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put our hearts together again

[Chorus: x2]",Papa Bear
Keith Harling,"[Chorus]
You got me right in the middle of where I want to be.
Making my every dream come true, and living my fantasy.
All this kissin' and a huggin' beats all I've ever seen.
Yeah, you got me right in the middle of where I want to be.
Well, five o'clock, Friday.
Things are goin' my way.
Headin' for a long weekend.
We've got ourselves a hot date.
Ain't goin' no place.
Gonna stay home again.
Don't need a dime to have a good time.
'Cause no matter what we do,
There ain't nothin' better than being together
And spendin' my time with you.
[Chorus]
So long as I'm livin' I'll be givin'
All of my love to you.
We got what it takes, we're here to stay.
It'll last our whole life through.

Keith Harling,"It's just three hours from here
Love so far but so near
I left her in the dark
And now she thinks that I don't care
It's just a quarter to call
Wouldn't take long at all
And I could be home today
But I'm just three words away
Chorus:
Darling, I love you
Like nobody else can do
Three words, I was wrong
If you'll forgive me, I'llc ome back home
Cause darling, I need your love
My leavin didn't leave me with much
Girl, all I can say is I'm just three words away
It's just my love in the line
That's got me wonderin why
I left my heart and my soul
Down in Georgia last night
Yes, I'm a fool and I know
I may have to live with my mistake
SO if you want me, my love
I'm just three words away

Keith Harling,"I pull the punch when I hit the walls
No one pulls shit when I fall
I'm isolated in a century of despair
Man's love's reflecting my walls are bare

My 4 walls
What a man needs when a man bleeds
Isolated
I am condemned

My life is drugged with sadness
I praise my sleep
It free's me from madness
In solitude my walls are bleeding sorrow
I have no future
No tomorrow

My hate explodes
Only my 4 walls know
There's no pity
Only peeling white snow
Headaches
Heartaches
It only gets worse
Inside my 4 walls
I am cursed",Four Walls
Keith Harling,"The day we met I saw you from a distance
Walkin' in the door with some friends
My world stopped, frozen in a moment
And I didn't want that moment to end

Then your old boyfriend, got to drinkin' again
Wasn't treatin' you right
So we got in a fight

Over you, never has there been such a fool
Never has a heart beat so true
So deep and strong, with love so far beyond love I knew
Before I knew I'll never will be over you

I can't forget that third day of December
I was scared as any man could be
But now that day is so easy to remember
'Cause we turned into a family

I was holdin' your hand, tryin' to be a man
But then our baby breathin'
I was on my knees

Over you, never has there been such a fool
Never has a heart beat so true
So deep and strong, with love so far beyond love I knew
Before I knew I'll never will be over you

And I've done my best to tell you all this time
How I really feel
This love is forever 'cause I know I'll never will be over you

Never has there been such a fool
Never has a heart beat so true
So deep and strong
This love so far beyond love I knew
Before I knew I'll never will be over you

The day we met I saw you from a distance
And I knew I'll never will be over you

Keith Harling,"Santa called a meetin' of the North Pole elves 
Said ""Listen here, this year we need a little help,  
There's been so many good little girls and boys 
The sleigh wont hold all of those toys 
So heat up your hot chocolate thermos mugs 
There's a Christmas toy convoy revin' up""  
Santa's got a Semi flying down the road 
Southbound, North Pole, overload 
Got a wreath on the grill, star on the hood 
He's checking off his list so you better be good 
He's got a speaker on the top playing jingle bells 
Red snowflaps on them eighteen wheels 
Tell me have you ever seen steel and chrome fly 

Beep, Beep, Bye, Bye, Santa's got a Semi  

Santa called up the state patrol 
Said if you see him coming boys let him roll 
We got a long night ahead and a big job to do 
They said "" Ten-Four Santa, you can roll on through"" 
But be real careful, don't forget to buckle up 
There's a whole lot of lovin' in big ole trucks

Your new dreams for old

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
