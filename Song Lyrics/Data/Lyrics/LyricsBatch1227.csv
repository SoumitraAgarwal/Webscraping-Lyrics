The Kingston Trio,"When I was young and dreams were new, 
I loved a girl who looked like you.
I saw her face in mountains stream.
I lingered there and lost myself in dreams.

But we were young and tossed away 
Our precious love along the way.
We parted strangers, thoughtless and free 
And set our hearts to wandering aimlessly.

But looking back, somehow I see 
How seldom love has come to me.
And I confess that now and then 
I think of her remembering when

If I were young and dreams were new, 
I'd love a girl who looked like you. 
I'd hold her close if she'd agree 
To love perhaps a boy who looked like me.

Oh...",When I Was Young

The Kingston Trio,"The white snows of winter fall into the quiet town
The town lies asleeping. Asleeping beneath the down
It soon will be Christmas. Bells will be ringing. Bring us another round
But here in the white of a cold winter night, my love cannot be found

'Twas only October, we danced the fire out
I called as I left her, ""Away from here I'm bound""
I've been to the sea and back to the land and many's the hill I've crowned
And here in the white of a cold winter night, my love cannot be found

And now in the winter I've come to find her here
My love lies a sleeping. I know that she is near
It soon will be Christmas. Bells will be ringing. Blessings are all around
For here in the white of a warm winter's night, my love at last I've found",The White Snows of Winter
The Kingston Trio,"I've tasted the wines of France
And I've tasted the wines of Spain
And though many a wine is the same
There are none like the wines of Madeira

I've courted the girls of France
And I've courted the girls of Spain
And though most pretty girls are the same
There are none like the girls of Madeira.

Oh, the girls who tend the vineyards
In the provinces of France
Are the gayest girls for courting
And they love to sing and dance

And they're happy in their vineyards
And they smile upon romance
And indeed, I would defend for you
The provinces of France

But there's not a vineyard anywhere
That can compare with what I know
Why? I'll tell you why or better yet
Come and we'll go

Oh, the girls who tend the vineyards
In the provinces of Spain
They are spirited and fiery
Whether beautiful or plain

They are splendid in their vineyards
In their languorous refrain
And indeed, I would defend for you
The provinces of Spain

But there's not a vineyard anywhere
That can compare with what I know
Why? I'll tell you why or better yet
Come and we'll go

You boast of the wines in France
And you boast of the wines in Spain
But your boast makes it very plain
That you not had the wines of Madeira

You boast of the girls in France
And you boast of the girls in Spain
But your boast makes it very plain
That you've not seen the girls of Madeira

In the tower of London, large as life, the ghost of Anne Bolyn walks they declare.
Poor Anne Bolyn was once King Henry's wife until he made the headsman bob her hair.
Ah, yes, he did her wrong long years ago and she comes up at night to tell him so,

Chorus:
With her head tucked underneath her arm she walks the bloody tower,
With her head tucked underneath her arm at the midnight hour.

She comes to haunt King Henry. She means giving him what for. Gadzooks, she's going to tell him off. She's feeling very sore,
And just in case the headsman wants to give her an encore, she's has her head tucked underneath her arm.

(Chorus)

The sentries think that it's a football that she carries in and when they had a few they shout, ""Is Army going to win?""
They think that it's Red Grange instead of poor old Ann Bolyn with her head tucked underneath her arm.

Sometimes gay King Henry gives a spread for all his pals and gals and ghostly crew.
The headsman craves the joint and cuts the bread then in comes Anne Bolyn to queer the do.
She holds her head up with a wild war whoop and Henry cries, ""Don't drop it in the soup!""

(Chorus)

One night she caught King Henry, he was in the canteen bar. Said he, ""Are you Jane Seymour, Anne Bolyn, or Katherine Parr?
How the sweet san perryann do I know who you are with your head tucked underneath your arm?""

The Kingston Trio,"Frankie and Johnnie were sweet hearts. They had a quarrel one day. Johnny vowed he would leave her.
He said he was going away. Never coming home. Goin' away to roam.
""My love, Johnny, please stay. Now, oh, my honey, I've done you wrong but please don't go away.""
Then Johnny sighed while Frankie cried.

[Chorus:]
""Oh, I'm a-going away. I'm a-goin' to stay. Never coming home. You're gonna miss me ,honey, in the days to come
When the winter winds begin to blow, the ground is covered up
And when you think of the way, you're gonna wish me back, your lovin' man,
You're gonna miss me, honey, in the day they say's to come.""
Frankie done said to her Johnny, ""Now man your hour done come."" ""Cause from behind her kimono she drew her forty-four gun.
""These love affairs are hard to bear!""
Johnny, he fled down the stairway. ""My love, Frankie, don't shoot!"" Frankie done aimed the forty-four
While the town went rooty-toot-toot. As Johnny fell, then Frankie yelled,

[Chorus]

""Send for your rubber tired hearses. Send for your rubber tired hacks. Carry old Johnny to the graveyard, I've shot him in the back
With a great big gun as the preacher begun.
Send for some policeman to take me right away. Lock me down in the dungeon cell and throw the key away.
My Johnny's dead because he said.

[Chorus]",You're Gonna Miss Me
The Kingston Trio,"Tom Paxton

It's a long and a dusty road. It's a hard and a heavy load and the folks we meet ain't always kind.
Some are bad and some are good. Some have done the best they could. Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound. Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

I have traveled across this land just a-doing the best I can. Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.
And the faces that I see are as worried as can be. Looks like they've been wonderin', too.

(Chorus)

I had a buddy, way back home, but he started out to roam and I hear he's out by Monterey,
And sometimes, when I've had a few, his voice comes singin' through and I a-goin' out to see him some old day.

(Chorus)

If you see us passin' by and you sit and you wonder why and you wish that you were a rambler, too.
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace 'em up, bar the door and thank the stars for the roof that's over you.

(Chorus)

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound, can't help but wonder where I'm bound.

The Kingston Trio,"All of my life it's been the same. I found a pot of gold, just a rusty chain.
I dealt a winnin' hand in a losin' game, oh, I'm lookin' for the sunshine, livin' on the rain.

Well, I've had some hard times. What can I say? I can't do no cryin' on the shoulder of this road.

The Kingston Trio,"Completely round is the perfect pearl the oyster manufactures
Completely round is the steering wheel that leads to compound fractures
Completely round is the golden fruit that hangs from the orange tree
Yes, the circle shape is quite renowned
But, sad to say, it can be found
In the lowdown, dirty run-around 
That my true love gave to me
That my true love gave to me

Completely square is the little box he said my ring would be in
Completely square is the envelope he said good-bye to me in
Completely square is the handkerchief I flourish constantly 
As I dry my eyes of the tears I've shed
And blow my nose which turns bright red
For a perfect square is my true love's head
He will not marry me, no
He will not marry me

Rectangular is the hotel door my true love tried to sneak through
Rectangular is the transom hole by which I had to peek through
Rectangular is the hotel room I entered angrily, and
Rectangular is the wooden box
Where lies my love 'neath the golden phlox
They say he died of the chicken pox
In part I must agree
One chick too many had he

Triangular is the piece of pie I eat to ease my sorrow
Triangular is the hatchet blade I plan to hide tomorrow
Triangular the relationship which now has ceased to be
And triangular is the garment thin
That fastens on with a safety pin
To a prize I had no wish to win
It's a lasting memory
That my true love gave to me",The Ballad of the Shape of Things

The Kingston Trio,"I thought I'd spend a week or two where we went last year. 
The little cottage and the lake that we held so dear.
But the trees all seemed much greener, much greener than this year. 
Thinkin' about last summer when my love was here.
And the stars all lost their glitter. 
They were so full of cheer. 
Thinkin' about last summer when my love was here.

Even the old caretaker who brought us from the train says this year just hasn't, 
It hasn't been the same.
And the winds across the meadow seem to hide a tear. 
Thinkin' about last summer when my love was here.

It hasn't been the same.
It hasn't been the same.",When My Love Was Here

Oh, I stood watchin', oh, I stood waitin' 
And as the rivers of freedom run through this land
I'll be there for to lend you my hand

Well, I listened to the shouting of those with their lies
Who tore at the heart of this country of mine
But here's where a quiet man with truth in his hand
Can make a stand and be heard in this land
So,

[Chorus: ]

So I stood by the watch road
Till the October of their days
With the winds to my left and then far from the right
Blowing my way

That has made us free

Well, the Goo Ga Gee is a mighty funny bird. He sings the best song that you ever, ever heard.
He learned this song from a little baby 'cause ev'ry little baby goes ""Goo ga gee.""

Well, the Goo Ga Gee is from the Milky Way. It flies down to earth ev'ry other day.
It hides in the corner where you can not see and as he flies away he sings, ""Goo ga gee.""

My home is in Monaghan where I was weaned
I've learned all my life cruel England's to blame
And so I'm a part of the patriot game

This Ireland of ours has for long been half-free
Six counties are under John Bull's tyranny
So, we gave up our boyhood to drill and to train
To play our own part in the patriot game

It's barely two years since they wandered away
And it was with the local battalion of the bold IRA
For they'd read of our heroes and they wanted the same
To play their own part in the patriot game

And now as I lie here, my body all holes
I think of those traitors
Who bargained in souls
I wish that my rifle
Had given the same

Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be
But the prettiest girl in all the world to me

Jane, Jane, Jane, she has no mom or dad
She's all alone but still she is not sad
The wild birds sing a song, her little dog tags along
To hear her laughter makes my poor heart glad

Jane, Jane, Jane, mark my bonnie Jane
As sweet as sugar in the cane, don't be ashamed
Jane cannot see. She's as blind as she can be
But the prettiest girl in all the world to me

I know Jane is sweet by the sounding of her feet
I see her beauty when she speaks to me
If she could see me now, my love to her I'd vow
But I couldn't love her more if I could see.

The Kingston Trio,"Mike Settle

When I was a little boy, my mother said to me, ""Watch the new born roses grow. It's a pretty sight to see.
You, my son, shall blossom as the flower below. I will be your raindrops. You will be my rose.

Listen while I tell you of the beauty in the sky. There's a home for angels on the clouds so high.
I must be an angel. In heaven I shall stay. If you ever need me, I'll hear each word you say.""

Now her raindrops fall no more. Who will take her place? Will I live to blossom full or wither into space?
Many times I wonder on the clouds above is it my dear mother who showers me with love?

When I was a little boy.

The Kingston Trio,"(Spoken) I remember when I rode into town that morning in December of forty-eight. 
Oh, bitter cold. 
I had on my parka, my sheepskin coat and my brown and white spectator pumps. 
Cut quite a figure if I do say so. 
Huh, cute. 
First thing I spied was a poster. 
There's going to be a dance. 
The second Hogsville dandy-steppin' ball and frog happin; contest. Drag.

[Chorus:]
Strange day. Strange day. 
Strange day in Hogsville, U. S. A.
I'm goin' to start off but there weren't no lady folk in sight. 
I figured they was all up a-primpin' for the dance and, being a man of no small charms with the ladies myself, I decided to park Old Paint and change my socks -- from him to me. 
(I find that extremely offensive!) So did Old Paint.
But there were no gals for miles around, not one gal in the whole darn town.
So, if you want to go dancin', just look around for the next best thing that can be found.

(Chorus)
That's right. 
I soon found there wasn't no women nowhere. 
Fellows goin' to the dance was takin' some of the strangest things. 
One was takin' a broom, all dressed up in a pinafore, bleached straws, looked kinda cheap to me. Another was totin' a picture of a girl. 
He'd been goin' with that picture so long he thought real girls folded in the middle. 
Now I was getting depressed, but then I spied the cutest little thing you ever saw, givin' me the eye from underneath the waterin' trough. 
Had little eyes, curly tail, and the dearest little pointed ears you ever seen. 
I grabbed her paw (What'd her paw have to say? 
Shut up when he's a-talkin'!) and we wobbled into the dance. 
The minute we get into the dance the music stopped and a feller said, ""Wait a minute! 
That's the sheriff's gal!"" (You mean?)

And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-fallin'

And the silent night will shatter
To the sounds inside my mind
When I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they begin to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid

And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

That don't mean no one no good

The Kingston Trio,"Have you heard of the ship
Called the good Reuben James?
Run by hard fighting men
Both of honor and of fame
She flew the Stars and Stripes
Of the land of the free,
But tonight she's in her grave
At the bottom of the sea

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

One hundred men went down
To their dark and watery graves
When that good ship went down,
Only forty-four were saved
'Twas the last day of October
They saved forty-four
From the dark, icy water
Of that cold Iceland shore

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

It was there in the dark
Of that cold and watery night
They watched for the you-boats
And they waited for a fight
Then a whine and a rock
And a great explosion's roar
They lay the Reuben James
On that cold ocean floor

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Oh, tell me, what were their names,
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Many years have passed
Since those brave men are gone
Those cold, icy waters,
They're still and they're calm
Many years have passed
And still I wonder why
The worst of men must fight
And the best of men must die!

From farm stead and from Fisher's cot

About the hemp rope on his neck,

There was never a tear in his blue eyes,
Both glad and bright were they,

His shining pike in hand
Around him marched in grim array

And stashed behind your couch

And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Hang down your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster
You know you're bound to die

You took her on the hillside, as God almighty knows
You took her on the hillside and there you hid her clothes

You took her by the roadside where you begged to be excused
You took her by the roadside where there you hid her shoes

You took her on the hillside to make her your wife
You took her on the hillside where there you took her life

Take down my old violin and play it as you please
At this time tomorrow, it'll be no use to me

I dug a grave four foot long, I dug it three feet deep
And throwed the cold clay o'er her and tramped it with my feet

If it hadn't been for Grayson, I'd a-been in Tennessee",Tom Dooley [DVD]

From the dirty words and muddy cells, your clothes are dark and stained,

So only stop to rest yourself and you'll be off again.

[Chorus:]
So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile. You're feet are hot and weary, come a dusty mile,
And maybe I can make you laugh. Maybe I can try. Looking for the evening and the morning in your eyes.
Then tell me of the one's you've seen as far as you can see.
Across the plains from field to town a-marchin' to be free,
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughin' children, one by one, they look like you and me.

She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free, but tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.

[Chorus:]
Oh, tell me, what were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James? (Repeat [Chorus]
One hundred men went down to their dark and watery graves. When that good ship went down, only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October they saved forty-four from the dark, icy water of that cold Iceland shore.

[Chorus]
It was there in the dark of that cold and watery night. They watched for the you-boats and they waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion's roar. They lay the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.

[Chorus]
Many years have passed since those brave men are gone. Those cold, icy waters, they're still and they're calm.
Many years have passed and still I wonder why the worst of men must fight and the best of men must die!

The Kinks,"Have you heard about trouble throughout the land 
With the fascists and the left wing militants 
Out of work executives are killing themselves 
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else 
Don't panic, don't lose control 
Keep your head, keep ahold 
Act normal there's nothing wrong 
Stay cool, just carry on 

You gotta live life and be yourself 
You can't live life for anyone else 
You gotta live life that's all you do 
Nobody gonna live your life for you 

Don't get depressed when you read in the press 
About world revolution and social unrest 
Try not to panic when you switch on the news 
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues 
It's only life it's really fine 
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines 
Live life see it through 
Carry on it's all you can do 

You gotta live life for yourself, can't live for anyone else 
You gotta live life, that's all you do 
Nobody gonna live their life for you 

Extra verse from long version
Trendy intellectuals always take action
For every cause that's ever been in fashion
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing 
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing
They got every solution for every revolution
They live in the slums just like the poor people do 
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks 
Then they salute the Union Jack
You can't pretent there's nothing wrong
It's not the end, so just carry on

He went and bought this house when he made good. 
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool, 
Where he entertained all the people that he knew. 
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out.

He went and spent all the money that he had. 
Because he had a heart and not a head. 
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry. 
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury, 
And the judge said to pay up, our you must sell out.

He had to tell all the servants to go away. 
Couldn't even afford to pay their way.

Far from all the soot and noise of the city,

Down by the village green.

And kissed her by the old oak tree.

And so I left the village green.

And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say ""gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?""
And daisy's married tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.

Two soldiers fighting in a trench 
One soldier glances up to see the sun 
And dreams of games he played when he was young 
And then his friend calls out his name 
It stops his dream and as he turns his head 
A second later he is dead 
Some mother's son lies in a field 
Back home they put his picture in a frame 
But all dead soldiers look the same

Someone is trying to be so brave

Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry cola
See-O-L-A cola.

I asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy,
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walk like a woman and talk like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night,
Under electric candlelight,
She picked me up and sat me on her knee,
And said, ""Little boy won't you come home with me?""

Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
But when I looked in her eyes,
Well I almost fell for my Lola,
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola lo lo lo lo Lola lo lo lo lo Lola

I pushed her away. I walked to the door.
I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees.
I looked at her, and she at me.

Well that's the way that I want it to stay.
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola.
Lo lo lo lo Lola.

It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world,
Except for Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola.

Well I left home just a week before,
And I've never ever kissed a woman before,
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
And said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man.""

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man,
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man,

If my friends could see me now, dressing up in my bow-tie,
Prancing round the room like some outrageous poove,
They would tell me that I'm just being used
They would ask me what I'm trying to prove.
They would see me in my hotel,
Watching late shows till the morning,
Writing songs for old time vaudeville revues.
All my friends would ask me what it's all leading to.

Sitting in my hotel, looking through the window at the people in the street,
Seven stories high looking at the world go by,

The Kinks,"Sung by flash, spivs and floosies.
Flash: they call me the scum of the earth.
They say I'm the scab of the nation.
But deep inside I'm only human.
Just an ordinary man.
With ordinary plans.
They say I'm crooked and bent,
They call me a rogue and a villain,
But if they could see deep inside me
They'd see a heart that once was pure
Before it touched the evils of this world,
For if I cut myself I bleed
And if I catch a cold I sneeze.
Have I not eyes to help me see?
Have I not lungs to help me breathe?
Have I not hands, organs, senses
And affections just like you?
Stop the music.
Well ain't I human
Like everybody else?
Before you condemn me my friends,
I suggest that you look deep inside you
For good and evil
Exist in all of us,
And no man is a saint
And each creates his heaven and his hell.

[Chorus:] we know that he's only a man.
He's got feelings and faults
Just like everyone else.

[Flash:] so don't put me down because I've done well,
For even wide boys, hoods and spivs
Have got the right to live.

[Chorus:] we know we're the scum of the earth,
We know we're the scab of the nation,
But we're your enemies and your brothers

And deep down we're all the same as one another.",Scum of the Earth
The Kinks,"Spiv: I was born a slum gutter infantile,
Brute-force educated, delinquent juvenile.
I am a product of mass produced factory fodder,
Streets full of tenement blocks, rat infested filth and squalor.

I left school, went straight on the dole
And unemployment's no enjoyment,
Welfare State owned my mind and my body and my soul.
So I worked my way up to be a second-hand car spiv,

But don't judge me harshly because I'm just a slum kid.
I built up my business with a quick wit and fist,
So don't double-cross me or my hoods will dissect you
With their black jacks and shiv.

Slum kids never get a break, they've got to fight their way up.
Wheel and deal, beg and steal,
Sweat blood to earn a buck.
I didn't want to work on the factory floor,

I wasn't content, I wanted more
Than to be a slave of a lathe,
Work all day and go home bored.
So a second- hand car spiv was what I became.
I built an empire because I used my brains.

[Chorus] 
He was a second-hand car spiv up from the slums,
So don't judge him harshly because he's just a slum kid.
Then he moved into property, stocks and shares,

Spiv: And into high finance and you've got to agree
That running a multi-million corporation
Sure beats selling cars second-hand.

[Chorus] 

Once he sold old worn out heaps to the punters on the street,
Spiv: Now I'm in control of the country as a whole,
And the world is at my feet.

[Chorus] 

The world is at his feet.
Spiv: Power, power, I've got power oozing out of me,
And when you think of all the things I've done
It says a lot for one
Who worked his way up from the streets.

Yes I'm a second-hand car spiv.
Do a deal, buy and sell,
It's my trade, I know it well.
Make a sale, ring the bell

And let the suckers go to hell.
Bank the profits, count the change
Another sucker comes your way.
Life is a crooked game,
And slum kids never change.",Second-Hand Car Spiv
The Kinks,"Sung by Mr. Black in an attic somewhere in suburbia 
When a solution comes, 
It's gonna breathe right down on everyone. 

When a solution comes 
It's gonna cover up the clouds

And everybody's gonna be terrified,

Looking for a final solution 
Searching here, searching there, 
Searching everywhere. 

Now my day has finally come 
It's time to shout to everyone 
I have waited a long, long time, 
Biding my time and waiting on the sidelines 
Watching it all go wrong. 

Witnessing the disintegration, 
Rubbing my hands in anticipation. 

Everybody's searching so desperately, 
They've got to run to someone

The Kinks,"Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so 
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based. 
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket 
It has honor, it has character and it's British. 
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments 
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply. 
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all 
And come to God's call with bat and ball. 

Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler, 
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked. 
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket 
And you know that that's not cricket. 
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin 
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in. 
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide 
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by. 

All through your life he'll try to bowl you out 
Beware the Demon bowler. 
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W., 
And bowl a maiden over. 
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous 
And remember that God is on your side. 
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line 
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.",Cricket

The Kinks,"In a deep dark jungle long time ago 
Lived a lonesome caveman 
He was a solitary soul 
And he spent his playtime 
Chewing meat from bones. 
He didn't know how to talk much 
He only knew how to groan 
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky 
Let out a yell and no one replied. 
Frustration and torment tore him inside 
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried. 
But then education saved the day. 
He learned to speak and communicate 
Education saved the day. 
He thanked God for the friends he made. 
Cause everybody needs an education 
Everybody needs an education. 
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white, 
Everybody needs to read and write 
Everybody needs an education. 

Thank the day when that primitive man 
Learned to talk with his brothers 
And live off the land. 
He left his cave and he moved far away 
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made 
He learned to think and to work with his brain 
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained 

He wrote it down on a rock that he found 
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around 
And then education came that day. 
The day it came was a sacred day. 
Education came that day 
He thanked God for the friends he'd made. 

Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail 
And he traveled far and wide 
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky 
So he learned how to fly. 
Thanks to all the mathematicians 
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s 
And the professors in their colleges 
Trying to feed me knowledge 
That I know I'll never use. 
Thank you sir for the millions of words 
That you've handed me down and you've told me t",Education
The Kinks,"How well I remember my very first love affair
Those juvenile fantasies and innocent dreams we shared
But we're too blind to realize that we are totally unprepared
For the first time we fall in love
We think it's forever, the first time we fall in love
We always treasure the first time we fall in love
Those other romances come and go,
But we cherish the memory of
The first time we fall in love

First love can be such a strain
It can rule your head, it can bring you pain,
And when it ends it seems such a shame
The first time we fall in love,
Can make you sad, it can keep you awake,
It can drive you mad
People say you're too young and it's only a fad
The first time we fall in love

The first time I fell out of love, it knocked me through the floor
My world came crashing down, it shook me to the core
I was unprepared 'cos I was only a kid
And I was much too young and I wasn't equipped
For the emotional pressures and stresses of it
But oh, I'll never forget
The way that she looked the first time we met
Time goes by but we never forget
The first time we fall in love

Love can be exciting, it can be a bloody bore
Love can be a pleasure or nothing but a chore
Love can be like a dull routine,
It can run you around until you're out of steam
It can treat you well, it can treat you mean,
Love can mess you around,
Love can pick you up, it can bring you down

Only slabs of concrete

Skyscrapers reaching up to the clouds
Don't give the moon a chance to shine
And I've got imitation moonlight
Standing underneath the neon sign

Is it real or just illusion?
Can there be daytime when it's night?
Is it merely my delusion
Or are my senses telling me lies?

Is it just hallucination?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
I don't know if it's day or night
When I'm underneath the neon sign
Underneath the neon sign

Electronic nature made by man with robots in mind
Big city lights guide my way
Into the night, darkness shines
When I'm standing underneath the neon sign

If there isn't any sunshine
We'll sunbathe by the neon sign
And if we can't see any stars at night
We'll sit and watch the traffic lights

And if there isn't any daytime
I've got an imitation dawn
I've got a simulated sunshine
Standing underneath the neon sign

Underneath the neon sign

Is it only an illusion?
Have I been drinking too much wine?
Can there be daytime when it's night?
Underneath the neon sign
Underneath the neon sign

Is it Mother Nature
Playing tricks with my eyes?
For dark is bright

Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stocking at Christmas
Open my presents and I'd be glad

But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor

They said
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money
We only want the real mccoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

But give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one I'll have a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothin'
While you're drinkin' down your wine

Don't get depressed when you read in the press 
About world revolution and social unrest 
Try not to panic when you switch on the news 
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues 
It's only life it's really fine 
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines 
Live life see it through 
Carry on it's all you can do 

You gotta live life for yourself, can't live for anyone else 
You gotta live life, that's all you do 
Nobody gonna live their life for you 

Extra verse from long version: 
Trendy intellectuals always take action, 
For every cause that's ever been in fashion. 
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing 
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing. 
They got every solution for every revolution. 
They live in the slums just like the poor people do 
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue. 
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks, 
Then they salute the Union Jack. 
You can't pretend there's nothing wrong, 
It's not the end, so just carry on. 

Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother 
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother 

You gotta live life for yourself, can't live life for anyone else 
You gotta live life",Live Life [Version]
The Kinks,"Everybody got the right to speak their mind 
So don't shoot me for saying mine 
Everybody talking about racial equality 
'cause everybody's equal in the good Lord's eyes 
But if I told you that God was black 
What would you think of that 
I bet you wouldn't believe it 

There's a self made prophet living right next to me 
He said the Black Messiah's gonna come and set the whole world free 
He looked at me with his evil eye and prophesied 
And he really believed it 

He said a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire 
And he's no liar, 'cause he has truly heard the word 
Everybody talking about racial equality 
But I'm the only honky living on an all black street 
They knock me down 'cause they brown and I white 

Everybody got the right to speak their mind 
So don't shoot me for saying mine 
Everyobody talking about racial equality 
You hear everybody talking about equal rights 
But white's white, black's black and that's that 
And that's the way you should leave it 

Don't want no Black Messiah to come and set the world on fire 
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world 
Everybody got to show a little give and take 
Everybody got to live with a little less hate 
Everybody gotta work it out, we gotta sort it out 
Everbody got the right to speak their mind

The Kinks,"Woke up this morning, started to sneeze
Had a cigarette and a cup of tea
I looked in the mirror, what did I see
A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees

I did my knees, bend press ups, touch my toes
Had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror, at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed

Surely there must be a way
For me to change the shape I'm in
Dissatisfied, is what I am

Woke up this morning, what did I see
A big black cloud hanging over me
I switched on the radio and nearly dropped dead
The news was so bad that I fell out of bed

There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, bread strike
Got to be a superman to survive
Gas bills, rent bills, tax bills, phone bills
I'm such a wreck but I'm staying alive

Hey girl, we've got to get out of this place
There's got to be something better than this
I need you but I hate to see you this way
And if I were superman then we?d fly away

I?d really like to change the world
And save it from the mess it?s in
I'm too weak, I'm so thin
I?d like to fly but I can't even swim

You talk like a docker but you act like a queer
You drink champagne then complain it's too dear

Then you cry in your beer and say you've got no friends

Or the way you dress
It's not your appearance, that they all detest
It's not your manners, that you gotta improve

A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees
I did my knees bend press ups touch my toes
I had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed

There's got to be something better than this
I need you, but I hate to see you this way
If I were superman then we'd fly away

The Kinks,"Ever since I was a child, 
I loved to wander wild 
Through the bright city lights, 
And find myself a life I could call my own. 
It was always my ambition 
To see Piccadilly, 
Ramble and roam around Soho 
And Pimlico and Savile Row, 
And walk down the Abbey Road. 
So I saved all my money 
And packed up my clothes, 
And I said good-bye to my friends 
And my folks back home. 
And I left for a life of my own. 
I left for a life on the road. 

I'm a real hungry tyke, 
And I know what I like. 
And I know where I'm goin'
To those bright city lights. 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, 
This time I'm gonna get there. 
I'm bound for a life on the road. 
Give me life on the road. 
I said life on the road. 

When I arrived in Houston, 
I was little more than a child. 
And I didn't know then 
That the dives and the dens 
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild. 
Mama always told me 
The city ladies were bawdy and bold. 
And so I searched night and day 
To catch a kissable lady, 
But all that I caught was a cold, 
Cause those stuck-up city ladies 
Didn't notice me walk by. 
Now I've got holes in my shoes 
Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night. 
And I'm livin' the life that I chose. 
Livin' my life on the road.

The Kinks,"Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are
There are starts in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard

I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

You can see all the stars as you walk along...

It's always been your choice
Maybe you're right and we're all wrong
We're only some voices
'Cause in the end it all depends
I step aside and let you decide

There was a season in your life
When everyone was smarter
The best advice that they could give
You'll have to work much harder
Then maybe someday you'll be wise
Realize, only you decide

'Cause everybody has to choose
Sink or swim, win or lose
No, not everybody gets it right
Fight or flight, so will you decide?

So you bent the rules, denied the truth
And all the strong suggestions
You ever heard your parents say
The giant misperceptions of who you really are
You come this far, who you are, you decide

'Cause everybody has to choose
Sink or swim, win or lose
No not everybody gets it right
Fight or flight, so will you decide?

Make sure, it's up to you
Don't let the moment pass you by
All eyes on you, what you gonna do
And all the swirling in your head
You got to use your heart instead

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're, know you're not a fool

I'm gonna leave this body now
I'm gonna leave this body now
Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby
I was lying on the floor
With the music in my head
The Todd Terry Project
Was the last thing that I heard
I had searched for the answer
It was not much to find
Then Kylie said to Jason
""It's all in the mind""
My mind was empty (party)
Had been for a while (party)
So I said to Kylie (party)
""Jason's got some style"" (party)
You got it, You got it
I'm gonna leave this body now

Oh Baby...............................Oh Baby

Of a seventies sitcom soap
""Some Mothers Do Have 'Em""
Or ""The Archie Bunker Show""
I was smokin with Felicity
The good life begins in bed
Richard was in the garden
Or I think that's what she said
Then in walks Skippy (party)
The bush kangaroo (party)
Rolf playing ""Sad Eyes"" (party)
And playing the didgeridoo (party)

And you haven't slept for several days

And your black sorry eyes made you pale

And you couldn't catch them
You couldn't be there
You couldn't help them at all
And it was cold

If we say there is something above the mountains
If we say that there is something we can't see
Promise you will never believe me
'Cause I guess I'm just trying to make it easy

One for you and one for me

I pick a car and it's a fifteen minutes drive

To clear my mind

Sometimes in the weekends
We meet up at our favorite café
I'll order a chai tea
And you will have the usual au lait

And when the place gets crowded
Then they freak out
And they play the music louder

Here comes another day in isolation
Hold out your hand, feel my brain burns
You suck and lick but you still don't know why
I could fuck your brains out
But I'm not interested in that life

Was it hard, did your heart breakdown
Is your mind still in control
There is a violence in love
Some things I'll never understand
So where the bullets missed you out
They hit me and I'm falling down again

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair

What's really going on below

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

It's not somebody who's seen the light

Lord how I've betrayed You every day that I remember
But You don't seem to care, You just love me standing here

Anyone but You, would walk away
Oh, if they really knew

You call my name
You call my name
You call my name
And I'll never be the same

Nothing I can say, could ever make You turn away
You're constant like the ocean, refreshing like the rain
Lord, I want to take You as my Saviour and my King
You don't ask to much, You just want my everything

Take what I've broken
I leave it all with You and start again

You call my name, I have nothing
You call my name, I can give You
You call my name
And I'll never be the same

So many words to say, how can I ever pay?
For you to be my freedom, nothing that I can bring
You give me everything, you give to me this freedom

I walked like the rest, did everything they did
But I never felt like I fitted
The puzzle I fit is somewhere else instead

You taught me the reason and how I should deal
With what I was keeping underneath it all

Far from all my cares
Not really a place more

A river of life flows
Through my emptiness

When I look into Your eyes

You take me away into Your grace
Deep in the light and life I'm lead
You give me peace, give me rest

To dryness rain brings dancin'

Robin, Robin, pray

Robin, Robin, pray

Forgive me God, for I have forsaken thee
I'm not gonna say that it's the devil that's makin' me
Do what I do, the things that I've done
Just because I'm young, and it's all for fun
I never really thought about the consequences
But ever since Eazy died, I said ""Now Ima listen""
Yay, though I walk through the valleys of death
I open my eyes, they droppin' like flies, my last breath
Might get snatched, taken, broke down I'm shaken
Shaken by that shit that's breakin'
Down your nervous system
So, if you're nervous listen
Kissin' cousins die by the dozens
Because I like good lovin' will I burn in a oven
Fiery furnace
'Cause sometimes the yearn gets
Tempting so I yield into temptation
Intoxication mixed with fornication
Face the nation, face the revelation the ending
Will I be caught up in the rapture 
Or will I be left behind because what I'm caught up in got me captured
Amazin' Grace, could save a wretch like me
But a wretch like me feels that Hell is already my destiny (Why?)
Because I messed with He (Who?),him
He who sends them
The demons
I see em schemin' amongst my dreamin'
They tell me he awaits suddenly I awake
I got a funny feelin' it won't be long before He
takes my soul that was the deal all for mass appeal
Dollar dollar bill, now my fate seems sealed
The nails in the coffin, he's coughin', I'm lookin'
Through my iris
To see if he's got the virus
Paranoia starts to sink in 
Deranged thoughts start to blink in
And out of my mind playin' tricks on me
Sufferin' with suicidal tendencies, since ten plus three
On bended knee I ask what's intended for me cause I can't cope
Some tellin' me I ain't shit, some tellin' me I ain't got no hope
Confessions of a young girl stressin'
Sittin' alone sweatin', burnin' cigarettes into my flesh
Not knowin' where I'm going, Can't understand why I came
I can't stand the rain, so I'm self inflictin' pain 
Gotta get a grip
Gotta hold on a little tighter to the end of this rope, before I slip
Into insanity
Lost within calamity
Forgive me for I know not what I do but what I've done
I confess with my tongue
To you
He who created heaven and earth, but still I'm still confused
I don't know what to do
Is there some way that you 
Could just clear my visions 
Can't see you with false prophets and religions
But I'm driven to find the force that keeps me livin'
But ifn'I might be mistaken
They tell me I'll be held accountable and fried like bacon
But wait, when I didn't ask to come here
Why is this all unclear 
I can't understand, it all seems unfair
They tell me not to question God, but the question is
Will I make it to live another day cause times gettin' hard
So you tell me to believe, have the faith of a mustard seed
Ask and I shall receive 
And you're all I need
Indeed, this may be true 
I'm tryin' to find my link to you
But, for all the things I do, I might not even make it through
Because we're all born in sin, so nine times out of ten
We're all gonna die in sin, same thing all over again
But, I don't want to fry God, I don't even want to die
So many tears I cry, so many years I try
I know I've done wrong I know I sing the same ole song
But truly I seek a righteous way, that'll lead me to be strong
In spirit and mind, body and soul
Deliver me from evil make me whole
God take control
Before it's too late, before you turn me over to a reprobate mind
Before you cast me in a lake of fire with my kind
Of sinners, for I am a sinner, I confess
I pray you forgive me and do bless
My soul to the very end 
This I ask God forgive me

Amen 
A-Men
Amen
A-Men
Amen

Hey God, can you hear me?

Eyes get wet and dreamy everytime a brother see me (cause why?) 
Cause they can't understand the gift of tongues 
That left em standin still and dumb 
In the dust, dare I bust, what I must, and I must son 
Continue to crush those that rushed, played dumb, and got done

Tried to be icing and wound up cake, translate

Lyrical muderer, microphone bone crusher
Yeah yeah why'all
Break a sucker down to dust, ah-hah

Now check the mic stalker, will wear you out like Walker
Rock a microphone like I was a native New Yorker
I strike HARD like Ben Frank's lightning rod
Leave you suckers scarred (uh-huh) leave you suckers charred
Now you're burnt to a crisp, so check the vocalist
I get sick with my shit, wicked like sadistics
It'll be a +Black Moon+ when I _Enta Da Stage_
Grab the microphone, turn from Robin to Rage
Then I shoot from the jugular, I get rough and ruggeder
You can't front on this big body Southerner
Your shit'll get smacked back, you're booty like asscrack
Who reigns supreme, baby no need to ask that
I bust on the daily, get down to the roots like Hailey
As I proceed to rock the mic, feel me, I
Gets total wreck and make crews pop, I
Rock from Osaka down to the Boondocks
Pop goes the rhyme on you weasels (uh-huh)
Rock strictly for my peoples, strictly for those Prince Edward evils
As I, blow up like spontaneous combustion, hah
I'll be the +Queen+ of MC's that's +Flushing+, hah
And ain't no maybe's, or might be's, cause if the mic be
Within reaches of my psyche, I just eat it up like Mikey
(I like it) when I'm weeded, so beat it, don't let me get heated
Or you just might get stretched out like Sealy Posturepedic
(Believe it) so it is said, so it is written
Until the day that I'm dead, I'll keep hittin
Always and forever spittin, from my soul for real
Down yellow brick roads I will, uhh
Chase them dreams, make more snap than green beans
Ask Mr. Greenjeans who's the Captain, I'm slappin
Fast-actin like Tinactin, mo' deeper than the ?
So get crackin, you don't want to Clash with this Titan
Whether freestylin or writin, the way I be breakin off mics man

Don't look back, or you're gonna be salty
Uhh, ah-hah, you best take flight like Maltese, Falcon
You're scalpin, your hearts palpitatin
Fluttering from the uttering of the vocab when I spake it
When I spit it, wack MC's get omitted
Now did it not occur to you, that I could serve a few
Good men or women, cause I'ma, equal opportunity, HAYYY
You're bound to lose, unless your name is Parker Lewis
Now let's do this, let the games begin (uh-huh)
Got suckers on the sideline mad as a wet hen, so you best
Step with that rambling, you're gambling with fate
I got suckers scrambling like quarterbacks from Grambling State
So, don't eff around Tootsie, you might get Roll-ed up
Sewed up, you best play like crutch and fold up
HOLD UP, watch me flip shit like a gymnast Mary Lou Retton
Best play like Omega Psi Phi and start steppin
Jettin on the first Delta out
Cause I make mics melt in my mouth
Takin em out is all I'm about, now check me OWWWWWWWWT
For hip-hop, I dies off with a vengeance
My vocab blows doors off it's hinges, with every sentence
And since this is the new age, uhh, ah-hah
All lyrical concoctions, by lyrical murderer Rage
Got a vertical hold, on verbal abusin ways
Cervical tubes get spayed, neutered, get slayed, tutored, DONE
Blood shit, on nuff shit, quick, handcuff this
Cause it's definitely Necessary Roughness

HAH, Necessary Rough when I bust

On your mark set flows, fluid like that H²O
I'm hittin' wit' the force of a gale wind blow
Windows can't stop the pain, can't stop the rain
On your parade march on cause it's the Rage
The baddest with the phattest lyrical apparatus
Boost my status in cahoots wit' +Gladys
Knight+ is fallin, from mics MC's are crawlin'
Cause they afraid to get down with my lyrical braw-lin'
Skills sho 'nuff, that's the rizzeal (real)
Brothas on my tit fo' the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin', speak it
Didn't think a wisdom body had techniques for freakin'
So go ahead and keep sleepin'
Because nuthin' comes to sleepers but a dream
And I'm your worst nightmare with puffs in my hair, you stare
At the big bo-ty (booty)
Style kinda choppy
Fill you up like Sloppy
Joes, when I flows

And you know it goes like that (mhmm)

Breaks it all down like that (mhmm)

Now if your name was +Midler+ I +Bette+ you couldn't get wit' this riddler
You could cross your heart and still couldn't detain this full figure

You got more hurdles to jump so go back practice
You must have forgotten
I could give it to you like God gave his only begotten
Son, you want to run up on this and get chaught up in the twist like Bambu
Not Onyx, but I can definitely +Slam+ you
So +BacDaFucUp+ or set it off if you want it
You can't escape these off the hook flows when I flaunt it
Now who can you run to, ain't nowhere to hide
When I kicks my shit I gets deeper than the Poseidon
Adventure, your dentures get knocked down your throat
Check the murder that I wrote, you couldn't hang with a rope
Oh no, yo' flows unh-unh

Ain't a harder way than mine
You gotta a long ladder to climb

I'm stunnin' MC's, with the breeze that I'm blowin' wit'
You can get wit' the wick and you knowin' it

Wise up and pay attention, and take heed

Always and forever to the casket bruh 
All up in that ass til you had enough

Period end of sentence, this is how I end this, hayyyY! 
Break it down",Rough Rugged and Raw
The Lady of Rage,"Hey, hot damn, ho, here I go again
You know who I be, and you know watcha in for
For your information
Me, I be coming harder than ejaculation
Evacuation on the premesis (I'm what?), I'm limitless
Run it to the limit, like Emmitt Smith, I'm listed in the Guinness's
For in the book of Genesis it reads
In the beginning God created Heaven then he created me
So you see
It ain't no way on earth you can see me
That's just how it B.E
You might as well drop that thought, cause it ain't goin down, G
You wishin, I'll leave you curled up in the fetal position
Impossible mission you think you gettin with Rage, well, then listen
You're thinkin the unthinkable
Rage is the unsinkable
Who can do it better
I gotta art for linkin letters
A diva run it like Gail Devers
Style so sick you think I got swamp fever
To all non-believers
Y'all ain't believin I rocks hard when I'm stoned like Steven
The way I kill it I leave you in a process of grieven
Leave you barely breathin
Kicks it so hard I knock out your teeth and leave you teethin
Take aim and shoot, knock you out your boots
I be the beginning of a New Testament like Matthew, Mark, and Luke
I turn the motha out in Levi Strauss
No doubt, make suckas do an about
Face, cut to the chase
They told me haste makes waste
And I'll waste you if you're hasty
Lyrically, it don't take much to make me
Fly off the handle
Go off like Roman candles
Scandalous not
Band you like wristwratch
Watch me clock a end, clock a grip
Watch me grip that microphone and cold rock that bitch
To your socks get hit
From the esophogus my vocal range will expand
And raise up and smack that ass like back hands
I got that shit that leave your whole section deaded
And, if you got no common sense you won't be ressurected
Fed-Ex it, my successes didn't make it over night
But over mics for you it could be over in just one night
Cause the R hits like Thundarr the Barbarian
Neva in your life could you ever scar the Aquarian
Water Bearer
Great Granddaughter of Clara
Bring the terror to your dome
As you get nearer to my throne
Them bones get crushed to dust
Cause when it comes down to struttin my stuff
It's necessary
I get rough
Cause I'm a lyrical genius no other could swing this
Better than I (Why?) cause I'm one of the meanest
Not givin a damn statin to all who I am
No need to cram, cause now you fully understand
That Robin is rockin, causin hippers to hoppin
Try to stop what I'm droppin, and a box you'll be popped in
Think twice, save your life, give me the mic
I say it again, yo, it won't be nice
You think I'm huffin and puffin, think I'm blowin and bluffin
You hens can't begin to contend with Robin
Voice smooth, lyrics lovely
The hippest hip-hopper, got brothers tuggin to hug me
Ah, dig",Some Shit
The Lady of Rage,"Ahh.. now I be drillin MC's
when my lyrics spill like Valdez, oil
Bubble and toil, the brew without the bitches

The only girl to knock you out the frame
Call me Mrs. Butter-cause-I'm-worth it, I work shit

Suckers get dumped in my dungeon
MC's hard as tress, but I'ma play Paul Bunyan
Chop chop, like an axe, my vocals stickin like thumbtacks
Ha hah hah, don't try to mock me cause my voice is on wax
It's, fireproof and that's the God's honest truth
Hard as a brick (*UTFO sample*) ""Bite it!"" and it'll break your tooth
or teeth chief, and that's the end of the beef, chew it

Now I gets sick like chlamydia from here to Syria
Drip burnin lyrics like venereal diseases
Strategic procedures (done at the what) done at the leisure
More +Flavor+ than Khadeija, inject you with my anaesthesia
Break them down to one cell like an amoeba
ARRI-VAH.. derci, you crab MC's irk me (ungule vato) but
I'm known as a heavyweight, my grandmother
told me to clean everything off my plate when I ate, so I
Crunch'n'Munch, on you suckers out to lunch
Definitely hittin em with the hardness

I'm rated top choice
with a grip on the mic like Royce Gracy
Ultimate champion, stand +Alone+ like +Acey+
Takes me about a sec to catch wreck (so what?)
So you can play like Rex and go fetch cause I'm too high tech
So once again (UHHHH!) let's break it down to the nitty
You used to be the shit, but now you're just plain SHITTY
Hah, now, I leave you, with a mouth full of lumps

""I don't care land""
Do you feel ten feet tall
I'm down here on the ground
With my heartache in my hands
It must be nice to be above it all
Sometimes I wish I was above it all.
These emotions that 
I'm wearing on my sleeve
Are sewn too tightly to fall off

The first top three men
I gave my heart to

I knew where I'd be
Between momma and daddy
Pew number three
Where I put my life in
To them scarred hands
The day that I fell for
One more perfect man.
The men I have loved
Have been mighty few

There are three kinds of love
That everyone needs
I knew that something 
Was missing for me.
Then you came along and 
Completed my life
I saw Jesus and daddy and your loving eyes
I looked up when you put
That ring on my hand
And I thank my God
For one more perfect man.

In the passing of our night
Softly reaching out for
A breath of silence within our pride
Pretending just like

Taken in
Taken far away to be as we once were
To be as we once believed in

Not in words
Not in fairytales
Not in silence or in front of you

Be still my nightmare

To be like everyone
Who feel and thinks they see
To want to fall or be in sympathy

Becomes my nightmares

Not in fairytales
Not in silence or in front of you

Behind the shadow
Lost and finding reasons she romaticizes

She hides behind, her smile, never a word

Crushed with the elephant man, can't you tell that it's us
Ain't no sittin' around now, then y'all better get up

Strong to the ladies, yeah they probably want me
I don't follow a blind lead, they follow me bluntly
Large appetite, my stomach is hollow, I'm hungry

As long as y'all want me I'ma come right back
And do what it takes to make a party bump like that
Uh, Mr. Martin Evil D on the track
Stomp it out y'all, show me where my people is at

Uh, I yell it out, I can't say it too plain
This is my jungle sucker, top of the food chain
I don't know what y'all thought when 2002 came
But this is my court and I'm runnin' the new game
I smash and dent and crash ya band
The glass and rim, blast them in, this is where my compassion ends
And I'ma make it quite clear check the captions kids
""Here we are"", right here's where's the action is
Poetical pachyderm packin' them in
Hoe catcher, dope snatcher, put my back to the wind

Stomp it out y'all, show them that we at it again

Over and over and over and over again now

[Verse 1]
He was a fly young cat, 23 to be exact
Ready to conquer the world fresh out of the pack
Comes from a small town, wrong side of the tracks
But somehow, he managed to slip through the cracks
He writes rhymes to escape what was awful and evil
Walks a fine line between lawful and legal
Seen a lot of bad times, there's a lot of good in him
Been around the world and still got the hood in him
If he carried a tech, would you call him a schemer?
If he sounds far fetched, would you call him a dreamer?
Stays true to himself, so he's not a deceiver
He found a lifetime job of making you a believer
Every now and then he would stare into space
And maybe think about if he had what it takes
He thinks about the hood and why he had to escape
And the family he left in that desolate place
It could be you or me or any man
Driving a sports car or a mini van
These are the aspirations of certain men
Who leave the neighborhood only to return again
Come on

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(I know life around the way is hard)
Over and over and over and over again now
(You got a family, they need you God)
Over and over and over and over again now
(The aspirations of certain men)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Leave the neighborhood only to return again)

[Verse 2]
She was a sweet young thing, tender age of 20
Comes from a poor family with no money
Two children of her own, she never let them go hungry
There she is, all right you go honey
Early in life she had a chance to win
But she chose to put her future in the hands of men
Ever since her first love she was sure she could handle it
But in the end all she got was abandonment
Over and over again they seem to use her
From jerk to creep and from creep to loser
Come on mami, who would treat you like a friend?
You need somebody, when will the cycle end?
Another break up, you don't really love him girl
You better wake up; you're in trouble girl
But in her dreams she's a queen in another world
Easy, breezy, beautiful, cover girl
On the runway to Mr. Lover Man's charms
She breaks away from Mr. Lover Man's arms
And just when she was sure she had enough of men
She turns around and falls in love again
Come on

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(Damn girl, why you got to go though this?)
Over and over and over and over again now
(I watch her stand there emotionless)
Over and over and over and over again now
(When nobody else noticed it)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Ooh, the sad songs from the vocalist)

Please embrace these stories
That have been placed before me
From hatred comes warring
From goodness must come glory
What is it I wonder
Some honor, some conquer
Different day, same drama
Remember it is karma

[Verse 3]
There's an old gray couple living right upstairs
Mid seventies, seemingly no cares
Always seem happy I can only guess why
Cause they barely getting by off the SSI (Hah)
Over the years their love affair grew
It was meant to be and some how they both knew
He said pray for me and I'll return to you
She waited faithfully during World War II
It was a hard time for a young couple just married
But they held on to the love they both carried
She read his letters telling her to stay strong
And on the phonograph played their favorite song (Yeah)
There were times they thought their love wouldn't make it
But like that old record, hard times couldn't break it
An old dusty record that they still hold sacred
And every anniversary I still here them play it
Yeah

(Chorus) (Last Emperor)

Over and over and over and over again now
(It was an old love affair)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Stand strong and they take it there)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Yes yes y'all)
Over and over and over and over again now
(We turn around and one day it's gone, come on)
Over and over and over and over again now
(I see you staying there)
Over and over and over and over again now
(Some times you got to take it there)",Karma
The Last Emperor,"[The Last Emperor]
Everybody come with me, lets take a ride
Turn the system up loud, let it amplify
Look around at the town and let the sounds lead you
Everywhere I see the remice of a proud people
Where little girls find their way in the world through mama
And little guys see the world through the eyes of fathers
Everybody wanna learn I to earn a dollar
We know there's more to the hood than urban squallor
Now, I don't need to take up ya time
But I just wanted to know what's on ya mind
Whether work is hard to find, unemployment line
Or got a job or ya blind doin' overtime
Don't be ashamed, you got ya pride
To maintain, after the rain, the sun will shine
There will be better whether for everyone
Though we all move to the beat of a different drum
Passin' the time in a popular way
Like Otis Redding sitting at the dock of the bay
I got a long way on this road but hey
I take pride in the fact that I'm alive today

Everybody on the east side, c'mon, let me know that you got ya pride
Everybody on the west side, c'mon, let me know that you got ya pride
Everybody on the north side, c'mon y'all, show me you got ya pride

Summertime the heat is hot, will I ever reach the top
Yo it's time to leave the block, finish my tequila shot
Mellow but sober when I'm in the car
So I can ride to the rhythm of the guitar
I hear the music I'm prepared to follow
The body overcomes the city of El Dorado
Mexican City that's paved of gold
Made sacred by the ancients in days of old
Brown pride, they got it down to a science
That's right, Old Metz, Aztecs and Rions
Combined with colours of a tapestry
Yeah I hear my brown brothers hollarin back of me
From freedom fighters, to the band deleroes
To the old man wearin' the tan sanbrero
From the food in the music that's la fiesta
To the afternoon nap thats la siesta
""Never venture out the hood"" is what some people say
But I love it to much to ever keep away
Beautiful brown people in the streets today
Who show me love when I'm drivin' through Easter Lane
And they say..

[Chorus]

[The Last Emperor]
They got you to rock to a slower groove
I hope you like all the things that I'm showin' you
It's all good, every hood that I'm rollin' through
Ya might not notice me, but I notice you
Livin' your life through poverty, I see smiles for as long as the eye can see
I'm proud of y'all and I hope that your proud of me
God bless the child who runs wild and free
City to city and town to town
I can see alot of pride as I drive arouund
Hold ya heads up high when ya feelin' down
Remember y'all we gotta stand tall and proud

The Last Emperor," 

(Verse 1)
Deep concentration, mental penetration
Hits me off the paranormal psychic information
Imagine every be	-boy and girl in third world nations
Unite become one through pure hip-hop meditation
Watch me closely, I separate the spiritual from the ghostly
Tap the Emperor get struck down like Obi Wan Kenobi
I am hip-hop so hold me, but no one had ever told me
That corporate America would attempt to over-throw me
Secretly plant and grow me, light me up and then smoke me
Got you thinking your the Godfather like Vito Corleone
As an underground artist my days and nights below me
Signing a contract like King Salo, now everybody knows me
Righteousness oppose me, wicked women don't approach me
I am a player-hater so ??? Nelson couldn't coach me
I flipped animalistic's, and the critics tried to poach me
Turned a crew of battle-cats into pussy-cats like Josie
Oh don't play me closely, it's the music that controls me
Hip-hop is mother earth and in my infancy she holds me
Single parent see single handily shape and hold me
When they tried to enslave me she train me how to set my soul free
Bounty Hunters capture me, in carbonate they froze me
I am the Dark Oder my two sons are Thor and Ockie
In the beginning there was the word and in the sentence hip-hop wrote me
If you're brave enough to meditate then come along and show me!

(Verse 2)
I'm an extra-terrestrial emcee, and I know some are doubting me
Like Han Solo fighting style, like awe Millennium Falcon me
I change shapes and mind states through the use of mental alchemy
I climbed the Tower of Babylon and through rappers of the balcony
My culture showers me, the microphone overpowers me
Separates me from rappers who use actions that are cowardly
That's how it be, hip-hop amazes me worships, praises me
Resembles favours me, allows me many ways to freak
Seven styles for seven days a week
Allows me to transform like soundwave and give up more tapes than Laser Beak
The things you see in life hip-hop provides you, over-rides you
Let the spirit of hip-hop get up inside you
There was a shoulder to lead on, but I had the one to cry to
Help me pick up the pieces made me hot enough to fly through
Tried to fly through, jacking me for my faculty
Half of these emcees get lost in space like Dr. Zachary
I jetted for the goal-line A and are's kept trying to tackle me
Sacked me and grappled me, I was the righteous of an athlete
At first I was alone now there's a 1000 kids that backing me
Finally got a deal and now the CIA are tracking me
I didn't mean to do it socialism just came naturally
I think it's time to meditate, my sentiments exactly

(Verse 3)
In the world filled with petulance and hatred
Some say we'll be rescued by spaceships
I stay away from crooks and study books by the ages
When the world gets to crazy hip-hop helps me escape it
No gravity I am weightless, broke from poverty to greatness
I create this and built this, kid rackets smelt the fragrance
One love, One blood I got rhymes buried in my platelage
You can state this, crease this, place this with emphasis
Now enter this, take shots like Islamic fundamentalists
Degenerate rappers I'm smashing attackin' with a passion
A-and-are-bashin', ripping lyrics built on fashion
Now imagine you just won a trip around my way
Full transportation all expenses paid
I've never been a player just the one who got played
Now my style kills more kids then Rouge versus Wade
Don't be afraid to join us on this hip-hop meditation
Where you encounter evil spirits, release hip-hop and let it chase them
And place them over here, forget the clothes that you be wearing
My style is matter free, I'm free but don't you go comparing
Your weekly shopping-sprees versus my bargain basement shopping
Your religion versus my black magic concoction
Tae-quando and boxing, moving soldiers to my locksmith
Your biodegradable rhymes to my lethal toxin
Rhyming is a gift and not an option
I gave birth to more styles then half you emcees got through adoption
Be careful of the lyrics and the rhymes that you be dropping
Cause while we meditate the whole universe is watching!!!",Meditation
The Last Emperor,"1993, shortly before Thanksgiving
I got the call, she said Jamal Derek is not longer living
Softly she spoke, is this a joke? Man you gotta be kidding
As my question was raised this explanation was given
A meaningless death made me question the meaning of life
Does my body remain at rest like when I'm sleeping at night?
Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise?
Be rejected or resurrected like the body of Christ?
Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics?
Or Nirvana that Buddhists honor in both theory and practice?
Like I study in my college philosophy classes
Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases?
I mean, what I like to know, is where my spirit goes?
After the curtains close, on my final show?
Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things?
Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
Who'll answer these said the great MCs
My man Gribbles battling a debilitating disease
He said you see a brother like me is willing to fight
And everytime I question death my only answer is life

[Chorus]
One life, yeah
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment
Am I living righteously
It gets hard
But I know I got to keep on
I'm trying so hard to be strong

Paralyzed on the bathroom floor by pain
Last month I endured, but now I can't ignore
Feels like railroad spikes being stuck in my liver
Am I dying? Eyes crying, body starting to shiver
Crawl upstairs from the basement calling my sister
(Sniff) Dawn help me, I ain't feeling too healthy
Stomach walls burning, head spinning and turning
Waiting for the EMS; 3:10 in the morning
Rush me to the emergency screaming like a newborn
The pain's too strong maybe my soul's trying to move on
They hook me to the I.V., put me through some X-Rays
Gave me Demerol to kill the pain that was the next phase
Early the next day in the hospital room
Moms and pops in the room, three or four docs in the room
Test results suggest your colon and your liver
Is so cancerous you got three months left
Me and Death is playing chess ever since then
My strength is the most high, my fam and close friends
The Last Emp and Set Free blessed me with a verse
Staying healthy comes first
Look at me things could be worst

The Last Emperor,"This is a single story, for every single one

Forming a single balance, under a single order
From a single act of love they have a single daughter
Along her way she put her faith in a single lover
And from a single lie she became a single mother
Of a single son, born to a single girl
Single home alone, in a single world
Though her kids felt her single pain
With a single kiss she makes everything okay
I wrote this record in a single way
So the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

Dedicated to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

You were my first teacher, my first friend
Gave me my first vision, and my first glimpse
Of a bigger world, given me my first look
Tuck me in my bed, and read my first book
And as I fell asleep, for the first time
Little did I know you were showing me my first rhyme
I want to thank you for showing me
How to be a man and turn my pain into poetry
Break my silence, express myself vocally
How to show the world what was once done locally
First one to take me on my quest for learning
First one to help me through life's stressful journey
And every single step, I'm coming with ya
Cause I belong to a strong single mother figure
You were the first one to tell me I was something bigger
I was an Emperor not just another nigger
First one to show me how I might be strong
The days seemed shorter and the night seemed long
Maybe that's the reason that I write these songs
To set the record straight and try to right these wrongs
This is the saga of a single mother
That's been provided by a single brother
I had to write it in a single way
So the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

Another lonely day, another lonely night
I dedicate this to y'all yeah its only right
Another untold truth is now brought to light
Another lesson is learned cause you taught me right
When I lost my way and the road got lonely
Only you, you were the one who showed me
Only you, you were the one to hold me
Sometimes I feel like you're the only one who knows me
And if you gotta stay single, hey
You should know this, I wrote this in a single way
The only thing I can do is pray
That the radio will play it every single day

I dedicate this to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too
Hey lady, this ones for you

Dedicated to every single mother
Just to let you know that were thinking of you
If you're a single mother too

The Last Emperor,"[Chorus]
We get it on, in the place; let them have it they can't wait
They get ghost, we give chase, can't run now there's no escape
Last Emp, why you tearing it down?
Why you make them put they ear to the ground?
Why they hearing it now?
Tell them now while you wearing the crown
If you afraid, leave your fear in the house, 'cause we letting them out

[Verse 1]
I prowl like a tiger, growl like a tiger
Let a nigga come around, pounce like a tiger
Deadly rhymes I announce and pounce when I write them
Wild out in my own house when I write them
I mean, he's way cool, he breaks rules
Gets cash in bundles, but he's paid dues
Wild type of dudes, wild type of crews
Run wild in jungles, caged up in zoos
Most niggaz feel it, some niggaz fear it
Eye of the tiger, come, come, catch the spirit
Any man come near it, track down and kill it
He attacked the village, ransacked and pillage
Scarp for your life, strap on your knife
Bring a gat if you like, just earn your stripes
When attacking the mic, sike, you can't get close
I kidnap bitch ass rappers and slash they throats
Cold rip through your tissue, crack open bones
Go grab your rifles and pack your toast
Don't blast and run, let's have some fun
Your man pass his gun, your ass is done

[Chorus] w/variation

[Verse 2]
I used to be a quiet type cat, silent type cat
Nigga fuck with me, wouldn't even fight back
Now I'm straight out the jungle 'cause I got it like that
Now this dude's on the loose, tiger strike back
I be the wild, no caring, stingy note sharing
Fuck us up, knuckle up, known for throat tearing
Now I'm quite thuggish, now I'm quite rugged
Ghost In The Darkness, too hard for Mike Douglas
Ghost that might haunt ya, Tim's that might stomp ya
Scar any face, many places he conquered
Animal slash author, man but yet monster
Bangladesh, Borneo, Sri Lanka, Sumatra
How the hell can you catch a nigga that's just too fresh?
Tiger that's this ruthless, try to track the movement
y'all niggaz is clueless, y'all weapons is useless
In this urban jungle we rumble across the U.S
Do this!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My tiger squad came to tear it down, y'all better beware it now
Coming through, hear the sound, pack it up, clear it out
Run and take the nearest route, we all up in your house
You see the tiger crouch, yeah you know what I'm about
Live a man, tiger man, every time I write a jam
I excite the tiger land, play me close I bite a fan
Rip it, tear it up and shred it, slash, slice, behead it
All y'all suckers in get debted, tell them how we came to set it

[Chorus]
We get it on, in the place; let them have it they can't wait
They get ghost, we give chase, can't run now there's no escape
Flow like water, some may say, water from an ancient lake
We came off beats that jump, tell us if we tore it up
In the club, show us love, music by Ayetolla",Tiger Trail
The Last Emperor,"To all my brothers who be putting it down
In the underground
For all my soldiers for protecting our crown
In the underground
Where all the wickedest lyricist found
In the underground
Who got the beats and the rhythms that pound?
It's the underground
Come here me now, feel me now

This is hardcore music, God's war music
The heart of hip hop, the blood that flows through it
Made for the chosen people that have been deprived
Though they sentence us to death, we still keep it live
Who bring the heat to these streets where we dropping these rhymes?
With a power that's refined and them cowards can't find
Who reveals God's design, cause its finally time
To speak out for those who live below the poverty line
See...

Underground is the defying thing
Well protected from the tyrant king
There is a message that we try and bring
Underground is where we cry and sing
Some, they kill for fun, but we not run
Cause we got guns, in the face of oppression
We fire back and ask without no question
Nooo

Who got that underground sound that you rocking with? (Who?)
Who keep it real and still appeal to a lot of chicks? (Who?)
I'm from a block that stays hot like the Gaza Strip
On the corner between hip hop and politics
See all my underground followers rocking with me
Where all my underground rhyme slayers keep it witty
And all my underground beat makers keep it gritty
Cause we provide the soundtrack for the inner city
Where the high price of rent ain't fair
Little dudes rock the same suits that inmates wear
Bullshit politicians pretend they care
And if the party ain't jumping then the Emp ain't there
I run with crooks and read books but utilize both gifts
Born and raised in West Philly but I ain't Will Smith
And you can catch me on the O, I'm controlling the spliff
Around the way they call me Maul, the Dark Lord of the Sith
In this...

Underground is the defying thing
Well protected from the tyrant king

If you believe this is a moment, control it

They lay so still in my head

Made a trade with the devil and he gave me your hand
We both know this castle's made of sand
Close your eyes and fall asleep again

I will fall asleep here in your arms
Every breath that you take breaks my heart

I built us this boat so we both could sail far, far away
It sprung a leak inside, the captain forgot to say
That love is made of treading water, hearts of clay
I had no idea, I had no idea that we would die today

The Last Poets,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Reflections of
The love you took from
Reflections of
The way life used to be

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

Now baby, why did you do it?
Reflections",Reflections
The Last Poets,"Selfish desires are burning like fires
among those who hoard the gold
As the continue to keep the people asleep
and the truth from being told
Racism and greed keep the people in need
from getting what's rightfully theirs
Cheating, stealin and double dealing
as they exploit the peoples fears

Now, Dow Jones owns the people's homes
and all the surrounding land
Buying and selling their humble dwelling
in the name of the Master Plan

'cause paper money is like a bee without honey
with no stinger to back him up
and those who stole the people's gold
are definitely corrupt

Credit cards, master charge, legacies of wills
real-estate, stocks and bonds on coupon paper bills
Now the US mints on paper prings, millions every day
and use the eagle as their symbol 'cause it's a bird of prey

The laurels of peace and the arrows of wars
are clutched very tightly in the eagles claws
filled with greed and lust,
and on the back of the dollar bill, 
is the words IN GOD WE TRUST

But the dollar bill is their only God
and they don't even trust each other
for a few dollars more they'd start a war
to exploit some brother's mother
Then there's the pyramid, that stands by itself
created by Black people's knowledge and wealth
and over the pyramid hangs the devil's eye
that stole from the truth and created the lie

Now ANNUIT means and endless amount stolen over the years
and COEPTIS means a new empire of vampire millionaires
And NOVUS is a Latin word meaning something new
an ORDO means a way of life chosen by a few
SECLORUM is a word that means to take from another
knowledge, wisdom and understanding stolen from the brother

Roman numerals on the base of the pyramid's face
tell the date they began to exist
when they established this branch of hell
in seventeen-seventy-six

Now there are thirteen layers of stone of the pyramid alone
an unfinished work of art
for thirty-three and a third is as high as a mason can go
without falling apart

Thirteen stars in the original flag!
Thirteen demons from the Devil's bag!
Thirteen berries and thirteen leaves!
Thirteen colonies of land-grabbing thieves!
Thirteen arrows in the eagle's claws!
Sixty-seven corporations wage the Devil's wars!
Thirteen stripes on the eagle's shield!
And these are the symbols on the US seal!

Now on the front of the dollar bill
to the right of Washington's head
is a small seal in the shape of a wheel
with the secret that's been left unsaid
The symbols in the middle represent the riddle
of the scales, the ruler and the key;
the square rule is a symbol
from the craft of masonry
The scales represent Libra
the balance of the seventh sign
They also represent the Just-Us
which you and I know is blind
The key unlocks the mysteries
of the secrets of the seal
So that only the Govern-you-men
would know what they reveal

The four words apart form the last parts of 
the secrets of the seal
and tells how they fooled the people
into thinking paper money was real!

Now, THESAUR means the treasury
where they store the gold they stole
and AMER means to punish
like the slaves they bought and sold
Then SEPTENT means seven
like seventeen-seventy-six
when the thirteen devils gathered
to unleash their bag of tricks
The SIGEL means the images
they've created to fool the world
like the colors on Old Glory
the flag that they unfurled

Now the red was the color of the Indian man
White was the devil's who stole the land
Blue was the eyes that hypnotised
with the tricks and traps they sprung
and even to this very same day
they all speak with forked tongue!
And so the power is in the hand of the ruling classes
playing god with the fate of all the masses
so the people don't get any in the land of the plenty
because E PLURIBUS UNUM means One Out Of Many",E Pluribus Unum [From Chastisement]
The Last Poets,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

Our Taj Mahal, our monument

To sneak up away
From your stomach
And try your pulse
And captured
What seemed all
Unknowing and candid
But they suspected
It was false

The boring would
Warn you be careful
Of her brigade
In order to tame
This relentless marauder
Move away from the parade

And she was walking on the tables
In the glass house
Endearingly bedraggled in the wind
Subtle in her method of seduction
The twenty little tragedies begin

And she would throw
A feather boa in the road
If she thought
That it would set the scene
Unfittingly dipped
Into your companions
Enlighten them to make you see

And there's affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before the attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart

Affection to rent

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

The Latin Jazz Quintet,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low
The Latin Rhythm Connection,"Hold me, hold me
Never let me go
Until you've told me, told me
What I want to know
And just hold me, hold me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you
(Hold me tight, never let me go)
Thrill me, thrill me
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be, will be
Hiding lovers just the same as we'll be, we'll be
When you make me tell you I love you
(Will you take me in your arms)
They told me, ""Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking this is the last you'll find""
But they never stood in the dark with you, love
When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me, and when you do
I know that you will miss me, miss me
If we ever say adieu, so kiss me, kiss me
Make me tell you I'm in love with you","Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"

Of the extra credentials you need just to get by, it's tough. 
My senses blurred, my body aches, 
And it looks like the nightmares are haunting me more every day. 

You say I would embrace my fears, 
A push or a shove onto worship or love and believe, 
I say no, oh no not me, 
If you want to succeed then darling get down on your knees. 

We were there, they swore a change, but never delivered. 
We watched while they slithered away, 
Big mistake, for such a fool, 
Well I hope you choke on your sizable slice of the chase.

Said hello to the Southland we're coming to you
We're movin' on oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free and I'm movin' on
[ banjo ]
Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
I've got a pretty woman in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal let the black smoke roll keep rollin' me on
[ fiddle ]
I warned you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
I'm movin' on I'm rollin' on
You broken your vow and it's all over now so I'm movin' on

But some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on stayed away too long
I'm through with you too bad you're blue so keep movin' on

This nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey, for my size

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Baby, how can I roll when the wheels won't go

Up on the mountain just to see my honey
And I ain't coming back, lord, I ain't coming back

I had a thumbs up for you, but it was caught in the gears.

But I still don't know why

Why does this ever have to end?
Why can't I give you my heart and hand?
I think you're too scared to understand
This doesn't ever have to end...go!

I see you standing by a window in the hall
Our eyes collide without a single word at all
The record asks, ""will you still need me when I'm sixty four?""
I can't imagine that I wouldn't need you more
Too many tears to cry
I just won't let it die

This doesn't ever have to end
Life is so long and my heart won't mend
You are my lover, you're my best friend 
But this doesn't ever have to end
End on",Ever
The Lemonheads,"I asked you what you wanted
You never give me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
The gleem in your eye has dove frozen stone cold
Gotta leave your side before it gets too old
Time out, times up
I really gotta go
Gotta find a way to let you know that
I'm fed up with you, don't know what to do
Wish you felt it too
I'm fed up with you
Sit around and watch TV all day
Stare at me and ask me what to say
Fuck off
Don't just maybe go away
I've said it before
Think I'll say it again
Louder today
I'm fed up with you",Fed Up

The Lemonheads,"I like to pick things up and drop them down again
I like to go nowhere tell no one where I've been

I dig laughing in your face and telling what I've seen

It's a bitch to be free
It's a bitch to come down where you ought to be",I Like To

The Lemonheads,"See it over there and in between my teeth
Rat velvet
It`s everything I look
And everywhere I feel
Tooth crack under foot and death`s head
Rustles near
Coup deville in sign
Cushioned razor smear
Rat velvet
Love my mom and pop
They gave me the rope
Buttocks scream coagulating
Never give up hope
Love my dog and cat
Shards of summer`s blood
Tooth defying death relying
Harold's under mud
Hate my mothers smirk

Laminated glory faded
Mama's on a binge
Chew my daddys
Underneath the porch
Slicey dicey oncee-twicee

You go out night after night.
You're sad girl. 
Ain't it a shame?
You're sad girl. 
Aren't you a pain?

Now you're saying something different

Maybe you've seen it all before
But I'm gonna tell you something more
There's no such thing as a second chance
There's no such thing as another try
There's no such thing as starting all over
All you ever did was make me cry

Been a long time since I've seen your eyes
Looking at me, looking through me
Now you're looking somehow different
Now you're looking somehow different
Been a long time since I felt your touch
Pulling me closer, and I can't fight you
Now you're doing something different

There's something that you have to know

The Lemonheads,"I know a girl and she's all that 
I love in the world
And I don't even know what she's thinking now
If I could be with her tonight
I know the arguing and the spite
We'd shout together and fight about whatever
Was wrong or was right 
It seems that doesn't matter
But if we could slow down and listen hard
Stupid arguing disregard
Love is heat with a light
Love's a sound you can't hear
When we are far far apart 
When we are too near
If I could show you the picture in my heart
If I could stop the words before they start",Uhhh

Time!

Wake up baby to the fact that you're poor soul's unclever.
Change your mind give me your life,
And you can live forever.

I got to keep it in my soul.

And then I went to the end of it, and the old man, well, he's ready to die.
And he said, ""well, tom, sincerity's the best gimmick. remember that.""
And I say, ""all right, be sincere, that'll win it? "" he said, ""that's it.

Oh, things are complicating, my love is in her hands
And there's no more waiting, she understands

The plaster's gettin' harder, and my love is perfection
A token of my love for her collection, her collection

Plaster caster, grab a hold of me faster
And if you want to see my love, just ask her
And my love is the plaster, and yeah she's the collector
She wants me all the time to inject her

The Lemonheads,"Verse 1:

Once I thought I was more right than wrong,
Painting myself in the corner.
What I bought and why it takes so long,
Something inside of her warned her.

Chorus:

I know that it doesn't matter much
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
I know that we won't go on as such
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
Could it be that hard,
To send you a postcard?

Verse 2:

Fragile smile, a ragged sleeve,
Didn't laugh once to often. (pause)
Before a while, it takes to grieve,
Try to repair what I've done.

Chorus

You laugh across the kitchen,
At something in a magazine.
I frown across the table,
So blunt, I'm never seen.
Your hair falls in your eyes as you ask
""what do you mean? ""

Verse 3:

See yourself never satisfied,
In the clothes that you try now.
I swore myself, I said I'd never cry.
Close to saying goodbye now.

Last chorus:

I know that it doesn't matter much
But I'm hoping to keep in touch.
I know that we won't go on as such
But I'm hoping to keep in touch.
Could it be that hard,
To send me a postcard?

The Lemonheads,"Your home is where you're happy
It's not where you're not free
Your home is where you can be what you are
As you were just born to be

Now they'll show you their castles
And diamonds for all to see
But, they'll never show you their peace of mind
'Cause they don't know how to be free

So burn all your bridges
Leave your past behind
You can do what you want to do
'Cause you're strong in your mind

And, anywhere you might wander
You can make that your home
Just as long as you've got love in your heart
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone

The Lemonheads,"Boy, the way Glen Miller played
Songs that made the hit parade
Guys like us we had it made

Those were the days
This could be habitual
This could be a ritual
Grown up learned to take it slow
Don't ever go, don't ever go

Those were the days
Burning down a blaze
Downtown stays
Don't ever go
You know I need you so take it slow",7 Powers
The Lemonheads,"There was a time I would've trusted you
There was a time that I would give it all away

There was a time I'd give it just to you
There was a time it didn't matter
What you'd say
What you'd say

[Chorus:]
I loved you so but that was long ago
When it only takes a day
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

Lying on my own again
Standing for whatever comes along
You'll never be alone again
You're only lonely when you let yourself get strong
Get too strong

Look at your catastrophe
Look at me how it has to be
Say goodbye, it's all the past to me
Just don't try
Not the last to be

Summer blowin' by and shining in the trees
I get the feeling that you feel no surprise
Unexpected morning had me on my knees
On my knees

The Lemonheads,"On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress
Running like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations

She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow
'Til your sense of which direction
Completely disappears

By the blue tiled walls
Near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to

These days, she says,
I feel my life just like a river running through

The year of the cat
Well, she looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli

So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The year of the cat

Well, morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away the choice
And lost your ticket
So you have to stay on

But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills

The Lemonheads,"Gotta own up on my own somehow
Toss the beginning and try to live it down
'N work my way out
I been so down about it

It gets the same every time I shy
Away from the blame and I stand my time
You can understand why
I been so down about it

She's gonna give me all the time I need
To finish it
And if I can't I'll sleep
Over

And out like a light when it's not plugged in
Fading around if it starts again
You just don't get it when
I get so down about it

I drop you a hint so I hope you don't catch
You fumble your keys and I throw the latch
You'll still worried that
I been so down about it

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strayed, madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

If I was the grass, would you mow your lawn? 
If I was your body, would you still wear clothes? 
If I was a booger, would you blow your nose? 
Would you keep it? would you eat it? 
I'm just tryin to give myself a reason, for being around.

If I was the front porch swing would you let me hang? 
If I was the dance floor would you shake your thing? 
If I was a rubber check would you let me bounce
Up and down inside your bank account? 
Would ya trust me, not to break you? 
I'm just tryin really hard to make you,
Notice me being around.

If I was a haircut would you wear a hat? 
If I was a maid, could I clean your flat? 
If I was the carpet would ya wipe your feet,
In time to save me from mud off the street?

Why don't you get down on your knees
And scrub me?

The Lemonheads,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
Out in her home I'd dwell
We decided to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I Beat That Fair Girl Down
She fell down on her bended knee for mercy she did cry
Oh willy dear, don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die.
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more.
Until the ground around us, with all her blood did pour.
I took her by her golden curls and drug her round and round,
Throwing(ed) her into the river that flows through Knoxville town.
Go down, go down you Knoxville girl with dark and rolling eye.
Go down, go down you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride.
I headed back to Knoxville, got there about midnight. 
My mother she was worried and woke up in a fright.
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding out my nose.
I called for me a candle to light myself to bed.
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see
They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail.
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl,
The girl I loved so
Well...",Knoxville Girl

When you re-realize that it's not the first time
You burnt the beyond when you learned how to fly
Just to learn later on that there isn't a sky
There aren't any clouds and there aren't any trees
There aren't any birds and there's no cinder caught in my eye

Till I've tied a tired knot and tried to untie it
Just can't decide if I should lie or tell the truth and try to hide it
