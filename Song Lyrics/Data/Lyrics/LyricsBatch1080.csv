Paul Rodgers,"Once I loved a butterfly
Don't wonder how, don't ask me why
But I believed what I'd been told
All things that glitter can't be gold, ooh yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all?
Her pride is headed for a fall, ooh yeah
All things that glitter can't be gold

Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the sun
Reaching and hoping
We'll find the right one

Now every day a new joy waits
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

So let us mind what's there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we've been told
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold, ooh yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

",Some Things That Glitter
Paul Rodgers,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't wake in the mornin'
I can't sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just won't sit right

You might say I'm losin' my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I don't want and I don't need
To play the cryin' game

Music lights this flame in me
I won't let it go and it won't let me be
I'm just a happy slave and I, oh I can't leave it
'Cause I'm still, and I always will be a believer

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Let me tell you why

We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll never die

I can't breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everythin' seem to go wrong

You might think I'm playin' around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe that sweet soul magic
Gonna tear my heart in two

Music makes the world go round
I've been flyin' on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I'm still a believer, headin' for the stars

Oh yeah
I'm still burnin'
Still yearnin'

Still burnin'
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
Better than every guy

We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll never die

Don't say that you love me
I can't go that road
But don't think for a moment
That my heart went cold

I keep thinkin' about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep and when I woke
Everythin' had turned around

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
Still turnin'
A new day dawnin'

We're jivin'
Still drivin'
Sky divin'
Early in the mornin'

Still burnin', yeah
Still yearnin'
And the wheel's
Still turnin'
Better than every guy

We're jivin'
And the beat's
Still drivin'
And we're all
Sky divin'
Rock 'n' roll never die

",Still Burnin'
Paul Rodgers,"Tell me something that'll ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying doesn't help me anymore
Tell me something that'll ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying doesn't get me anywhere

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand, how to love and how to give?
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Can't face it and there's no place I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

Tell me something 'cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand, how to love and how to give?
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love, there's nowhere I can hide

I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

",Through the Night
Paul Rodgers,"With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the ground, your head in the clouds
And you're wondering if you're ever coming down

In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here's to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine

A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of songs to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered, have we forgotten oh, so much?

Raise up your mind
It's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine

Let's awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise

Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it's time to shine

Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It's time to shine
It's time to shine

",Time To Shine
Paul Rodgers,"I believe there's no evil out there
We didn't have a hand in
You believe it's a time for peace
And a time for understanding

Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side, we'll win the game
And some of us believe that there's a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let's get it straight

I believe there's just once chance in this world
To hear our brothers
Yeah, you believe there's a better way
To listen to each other

We don't get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we don't understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

We believe there's a better way to fight
There's a way to make our children safe at night, yeah we believe
And we believe there's a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

I believe we need a hero to step boldly
From the shadows, yeah
You believe there must be someone
On the scene that fits the bill

A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes, match the intent with the deed

Oh, we believe there's a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation
In our time, we believe

We believe there's not a minute
We should be wasting
When the darkness falls
It's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need
That's why we believe

Every father, every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We believe there's a song that's worth the singing
It's a song of truth we're bringing
There's a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun

Yeah, that's what we believe
Hey, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, that's what we believe

",We Believe
Paul Rodgers,"In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

For my life
Still ahead
Pity me",'39
Paul Rodgers,"You and me
We are destined
You'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives
With each other
The rest of our days
Like two lovers
Forever yeah, forever

Paul Rodgers,"Words and music by freddie mercury
Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy,i need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come,easy go,
A little high,little low,
Anyway the wind blows,doesn't really matter to me,
To me

Mama,just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,
Mama,life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on,carry on,as if nothing really matters

Too late,my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go,will you let me go
Bismillah, no,we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,for me,for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,nothing really matters to me,

Any way the wind blows",Bohemian Rhapsody

Paul Rodgers,"What planet is this hmm?
Let there be rock 'n' roll!

It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone
With the music on quiet I'm flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud hear it in the street
Then the neighbors start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point
Come on in let's rock this joint

We got the whole house rocking [Repeat: x5]
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll

We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and they get down
Then the police man says ""stop this noise""
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys
The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys

Come on down let's rock this town

We got the whole town rocking [Repeat: x5]
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll

Let's go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The cosmos rocks
Across seven seas through the Panama,
Now they're rockin' on beaches
And they're rockin' in bars
Don't ask me how and don't ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There's a rock 'n' roll fever
In every place
Next thing you know
They'll be rockin' out in space

Come on down let's rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me

We got the whole world rocking [Repeat: x5]
To the mighty mighty mighty power

So much reason to grieve

You know, my father told me, son don't rush to be a man 
You know, my father told me, son don't you rush to be a man 
But I went ahead on, and now I think I'm drowning on dry land 

You know my mother told me the story, about that li'l dog that couldn't see 
Too well 
He was crossing a railroad track one day, when the train cut off a part of 
His tail 
He turned around but never looked up, just to peep over the rail 
And she said he lost his whole head, trying to find a little piece of tail

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

Paul Shaffer,"Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space,
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream,
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way",Fantasy
Paul Shaffer,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years

'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!

Paul Siebel,"If you don't love her you'd better let her go
You'll never fool her you're bound to let it show
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake
Everything in return
You just preserve her
When you serve her a little tenderness

If she's a woman she'll try to make it last
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast
There's no reason here, no treason here
Just the way a woman's mind
Well she has no name she has no shame
She just loves you

It's not easy to undo what's done
Or to speak too freely to just anyone

It was written on the walls and window shades
And how she'd act the little girl

Sometimes a bottle of perfume,
Flowers and maybe some lace
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets
Their intentions were easily traced
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried
But women like Louise they get by

Well everybody thought it kind of sad
When they found Louise in her room
They'd always put her down below their kind
Still some cried when she died this afternoon
Lousie rode home on the mail train
Somewhere to the south I heard it said
Too bad it ended so ugly,
Too bad she had to go this way
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight

Paul Siebel,"Well come gather around me friends of mine, 
While I sing to you about a minstrel band
Of children in their witches hats, 
Painting pictures with the pipes of pan

How a young boy and his sister played some tunes 
Upon a whistle made of tin
And led me through the flower gardens, 
Laughing at the postman's stubby chin

And in my dizzy stupor, 
I was trying to forfeit all I'd known
And listen to that music that could swirl me in a magic all it's own

But somewhere in the distance, 
You and I, we fought our monsters to a draw
It was in those days of books and wine, 
With Ferlin Getty grasping for a straw

And out along the highways, 
We journeyed far to find that mystic smile
Chasing down identities, 
My God we must have run a million miles

So we can teach the children, 
Nothing, nothing but survival in the desert bare
They can teach us how to laugh, 
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

So sing for us you children, 
Tinkle bells and rhyme the purple, greens and blues
Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you

Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you

Someone that turns your heart around

Past the shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.
I don't know what is real,
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.
The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right

And I wander in the night without direction.
So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.
It's no matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow,
So my fantasy
Becomes reality,
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.

Paul Simon,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December,
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island.

I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock,

And my poetry to protect me,

Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls.

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies.

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day.

And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you.

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain

And they crumble in your hand

That's what Mrs. Reardon says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone within a house
Within a room, within himself
A most peculiar man

He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't
Care
And he wasn't like them
O, no-o-o!
He was a most peculiar man

He died last Sat-you're-day...
He turned on the gas! and he went to sleep!
With the windows closed!
So he'd never wake up!
To his silent world!
And his tiny room!
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere!

Who should be notified so-oo-oon...

And all the people said,
What a shame that he's dead,
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?

",A Most Peculiar Man
Paul Simon,"The night sets softly
With the hush of falling leaves,
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees,

And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall,
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawL

Up a narrow flight of stairs
In a narrow Little room,
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom.

Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me.

From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death,
There are Patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath.

Like a rat in a maze
The path before me lies,
And the pattern never alters
Until the rat dies.

And the pattern still remains
On the wall where darkness fell,
And it's fitting that it should,
For in darkness I must dwell.

Like the color of my skin,
Or the day that I grow old,
My life is made of Patterns
That can scarcely be controlled",Patterns
Paul Simon,"On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'
A little boy lies asleep in the earth
While down in the valley a cruel war rages
And people forget what a child's life is worth

On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps
And waters the grave with its silent tears
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
That ended a life at the age of seven years

And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'
And generals order their men to kill
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill",The Side of a Hill
Paul Simon,"Hello darkness, my old friend, 
I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping, 
And the vision that was planted in my brain 
Still remains 
Within the sound of silence 

In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence 

And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence 

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you"" 
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon God they made 
And the sign flashed its warning, 
In the words that it was forming 
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets 
Are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls"" 
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Sound of Silence

Paul Simon,"A passenger traveling quietly conceals himself 
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Over the crest of the mountains the moon
Begins its climb

And he wakes to find he's in rolling farm land

The farmer sleeps against his wife
He wonders what their life must be
A trailways bus is heading south into
Washington, D.C.

A mother and child, the baby maybe two
Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding
The shadow of the capitol dome
Slides across his face
And his heart is racing with the urge to
Freedom
The father motionless as stone
A shepherd resting with his flock
The trailways bus is turning west
Dallas via Little Rock

Oh my darling darling Sal
The desert moon is my witness
I've no money to come east
But I know you'll soon be here

We pull into downtown Dallas by the
Sight of the grassy knoll
Where the leader fell and a town was broken
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken

The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus
Any aliens here you better check with us
How about you son you like you've got
Spanish blood
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood

Yes I am an alien from Mars

I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting

Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly

Over and over again

No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine

I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

But I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away

You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Delores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

He's slip slidin'
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
But the last one to know
When something goes right
Well it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me
It's such an unusual sight
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

They've got a wall in China
It's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners
They made it strong
I've got a wall around me
You can't even see
It took a little time
To get to me

I love you
It's not their style

Some people never say those words
I love you

To be told

Paul Simon,"I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years",Still Crazy After All These Years

Stranded in a limousine

They come running out their front doors
Running out their back doors
Flying on their feet

Where the dancing is elite

You can wear your summer clothes
In the New Orleans

And I will lay my burden down
Rest my head upon that shore
And when I wear that starry crown
I won't be wanting anymore

Waits by the side of the road

The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a ""J""
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one

Have you ever experienced a period of grace 
When your brain just takes a seat behind your face 
And the world begins The Elephant Dance 
Everything's funny 
Everyone's sunny 
You take out your money 
And walk down the road 
That leads me to the girl I love 
The girl I'm always thinking of 

But maybe I think too much 
And I ought to just hold her

Maybe blindfold her

Paul Simon,"She was beautiful as southern skies the night he met her
She was married to someone
He was doggedly determined that he would get her
He was old she was young

From time to time
He'd tip his heart
But each time she withdrew
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

Well eventually the boy and the girl get married
Sure enough they have a son
And though they were both occupied with the child she carried
Disagreements had begun

And in a while
They fell apart
It wasn't hard to do
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

Two disappointed believers
Two people playing the game
Negotiations and love songs
Are often mistaken for one and the same

Now the man and the woman they remain in contact
Let us say it's for the child
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract
Conversations hard and wild

But from time to time he makes her laugh
She cooks a meal of two
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true

What is the point of this story
What information pertains
The thought that life could be better
Is woven indelibly
Into our hearts and our brains",Train in the Distance
Paul Simon,"I have a number in my head
Thought I don't know why it's there
When numbers get serious
You see their shape everywhere
Dividing and multiplying
Exchanging with ease
When times are mysterious
Serious numbers are eager to please

Take my address
Take my phone
Call me if you can
Here's my address
Here's my phone
Please don't give it to some madman
Hey hey, whoa whoa
Complicated life
Numbers swirling thick and curious
You can cut them with a knife
You can cut them with a knife

Two times two is twenty-two
Four times four is forty-four
When numbers get serious
They leave a mark on your door
Urgent! Urgent!
A telephone ringing in the hallways
When times are mysterious
Serious numbers will speak to us always

That is why a man with numbers
Can put your mind at ease
We've got numbers by the trillions
Here and overseas
Hey hey, whoa whoa
Look at the stink about Japan
All those numbers waiting patiently
Don't you understand?
Don't you understand?

So wrap me
Wrap me
Wrap me do
In the shelter of your arms
I am ever your volunteer
I won't do you any harm
I will love you innumerably
You can count on my word
When times are mysterious
Serious numbers will always be heard

And after all is said and done
And the numbers all come home
The four rolls into three
The three turns into two
And the two becomes a
One",When Numbers Get Serious
Paul Simon,"I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh Still crazy after all these years

I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade

Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years",Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog After the War [Original Aco]

In a taxi heading downtown
Rearranging my position
On this friend of mine who had

A little bit of a breakdown
I said breakdowns come
And breakdowns go
So what are you going to do about it

That's what I'd like to know
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could

It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall

I said hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be
I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt

You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You don't feel you could love me

When I thought I heard this voice say
Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
On the very same day

I said hey Senorita that's astute
I said why don't we get together

Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great

I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette

Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
Dancing to Zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck

If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette

The pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
His path was marked
By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere
And he walked his days

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out
These are the roots of rhythm
And the roots of rhythm remain

In early memory
Mission music
Was ringing 'round my nursery door
I said take this child, Lord
From Tucson Arizona
Give her the wings to fly through harmony
And she won't bother you no more

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out

When you'll be tired
As tired as a dream that wants to die
And further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

Maybe you will find a love
That you discover accidentally
Who falls against you gently
As a pickpocket
Brushes your thigh
Further to fly

The spinning darkness of her hair
A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere
The open palm of desire
Wants everything
It wants everything
It wants everything

Sometimes I'll be walking down
The street and I'll be thinking
Am I crazy
Or is this some morbid little lie
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

A recent loss of memory
A shadow in the family
The baby waves bye-bye
I'm trying, I'm flying

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my light
Days falling backward into velvet night
The open palm of desire
Wants everything
It wants everything
It wants soil as soft as summer
And the strength to push like spring

A broken laugh a broken fever
Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry
Further to fly

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my sight

Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Songs from the mouth of the river
When the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night

By moon 
We walk
To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone
Women with their nursing children
Seated on the floor
We join the fevers
And the broken bones

The candlelight flickers
The falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy â?? heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night

My hands are numb
My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
The sweetness in the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo

Paul Simon,"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America",America
Paul Simon,"Down among the reeds and rushes
A baby boy was found
His eyes as clear as centuries
His silky hair was brown

Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time

Me and my buddies we are traveling people
We like to go down to restaurant row
Spend those Euro-dollars
All the way from Washington to Tokyo
I see them in the airport lounge
Upon their mother's breast
They follow me with open eyes
Their uninvited guest

Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time

Too many people on the bus from the airport
Too many holes in the crust of the earth
The planet groans
Every time it registers another birth

But down among the reeds and rushes
A baby girl was found
Her eyes as clear as centuries
Her silky hair was brown

Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time",Born at the Right Time
Paul Simon,"When you're weary, feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes, i will dry them all;
I'm on your side. when times get rough
And friends just can't be found,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
When you're down and out,
When you're on the street,
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you.
I'll take your part.
When darkness comes
And pains is all around,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.

Sail on silvergirl,
Sail on by.
Your time has come to shine.
All your dreams are on their way.
See how they shine.

I'm sailing right behind.

I will ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.",Bridge over Troubled Water

Paul Simon,"A family of musicians took shelter for the night
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine
Rose of Jericho and Bougainvillea

This is a lonely life 
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

A trip to the market
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight
Settling over Washington
A trip to the market
A trip around the world
Where the evening meal
Is negotiable, if there is one.

This is a lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something

In the harbor church of St. Cecilia
To praise a soul's returning to the earth
To the rose of Jericho and the Bougainvillea

Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now

Paul Simon,"Soon our fortunes will be made, my darling
And we leave this loathsome little town
Silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots, my baby
Silver foil to trim your wedding gown

A mind wanders
It seems mindless, but it does
Sometimes I see your face
As if through reading glasses
And your smile seems softer than it was

It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts

But feel the bite

You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends
She moves on

Feel so blessed

Inside my chest, but she

Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks
She jumps back
But she moves on

She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ??

Then I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
And I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes

She can't sleep now
The moon is red
She fights a fever
She burns in bed
She needs to talk so
We take a walk
Down in the maroon light

She says â??Maybe these emotions are
As near to love as love will ever beâ??
So I agree
Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on

She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ??

I grow weak, I go slack

Voice in a bottle

Paul Simon,"It was a slow day 
And the sun was beating 
On the soldiers by the side of the road 
There was a bright light 
A shattering of shop windows 
The bomb in the baby carriage 
Was wired to the radio 

These are the days of miracle and wonder 
This is the long distance call 
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo

Don't cry

And it swept across the desert 
And it curled into the circle of birth 
And the dead sand 
Falling on the children 
The mothers and the fathers 
And the automatic earth 

These are the days of miracle and wonder 
This is the long distance call 
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo 
The way we look to us all, oh yeah

The way we look to a distant constellation 
That's dying in a corner of the sky 
These are the days of miracle and wonder 
And don't cry baby, don't cry 
Don't cry 

It's a turn-around jump shot 
It's everybody jump start 
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts 
Medicine is magical and magical is art 
The boy in the bubble 
And the baby with the baboon heart 

And I believe 
These are the days of lasers in the jungle 
Lasers in the jungle somewhere 
Staccato signals of constant information 
A loose affiliation of millionaires 
And billionaires and baby

Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes boss, the government handshake
Yes boss, the crusher of language
Yes boss, Mr. Stillwater
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run

Who says: Hard times?

Paul Simon,"The night was black, the roads were icy 
Snow was fallin', drifts were high
And I was weary from my driving
And I stopped to rest for awhile

I sat down at a truck stop
I was thinking about my past
I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I'm praying it's gone at last

[Chorus]
Gone at last, gone at last 
Gone at last, gone at last
I had a long streak of bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last
Oo, oo, oo... 

I ain't dumb
I kicked around some
I don't fall too easily 
But that boy looked so dejected 
He just grabbed my sympathy

Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?
Tell me why you're so downcast 
I've had a long streak of bad luck 
But I pray it's gone at last

[Chorus]

Once in a while from out of nowhere
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared
Somebody will come and lift you higher
And your burdens will be shared

Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you 
I might still be sinking fast
I've had a long streak of that bad luck
But I pray it's gone at last 

[Chorus]",Gone at Last
Paul Simon,"The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow

I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland

And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland

There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow

In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland",Graceland

Paul Simon,"Well I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep through the night
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

And in remembering a road sign
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And we said these songs are true
These days are ours
These tears are free
And hey
The cross is in the ballpark
The cross is in the ballpark

We had a lot of fun
We had a lot of money
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
Sonny gets married and moves away
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
Sonny gets sunnier
Day by day by day by day

I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child?

Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some roots are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down on the shelf
And he idle thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night
Some people say a lie is just a lie
But I say
The cross is in the ballpark
Why deny the obvious child?",The Obvious Child
Paul Simon,"Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blowin' through the grass
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears

",Old Friends
Paul Simon,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
And grace my fear relieved 
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares 
We have already come 
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
And grace will lead us home
When we've been there ten thousand years 
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise 
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace
Paul Simon,"Moves like a fist through traffic
Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump 
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean

Yes Boss. The government handshake
Yes Boss. The crusher of language
Yes Boss. Mr. Stillwater,
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river

I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side

Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God

And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run

Who says: Hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears","The Cool, Cool River [Live]"
Paul Simon,"There may come a time
When you'll be tired
As tired as a dream
That wants to die

And further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

Maybe you will find a love
That you discover accidentally
Who falls against you gently
As a pickpocket brushes your thigh

Further to fly

Effortless music from the Cameroons
The spinning darkness of her hair
A conversation in a crowded room going nowhere
The open palm of desire wants everything
It wants everything, it wants everything

Sometimes I'll be walking down
The street and I'll be thinking
Am I crazy
Or is this some morbid little lie

Further to fly
Further to fly
Further to fly

A recent loss of memory
A shadow in the family
The baby waves bye-bye
I'm trying, I'm flying

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my light
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire
Wants everything, it wants everything
It wants soil as soft as summer
And the strength to push like spring

A broken laugh, a broken fever
Take it up with the great deceiver
Who looks you in the eye
And says baby don't cry

Further to fly

There may come a time
When I will lose you
Lose you as I lose my sight
Days falling backward into velvet night

The open palm of desire
The rose of Jericho
Soil as soft as summer
The strength to let you go

Then that's good luck, runnin' through young veins
And if life is a blessing

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma

If the heart is an open memory book
That was the chance I took
The more I searched
The more I shook for Thelma

Last night I slept on a rented pillow
A silver moon above my head
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed

Now the first time that I saw you I thought
She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught
People aware of my history
Trying to steer you away from me
I left a message at your hotel
Don't let management poison the well

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma

The phone is ringing and I realize
We are time zones and oceans apart
The words I speak in the middle of my night
Fall on your yesterday's heart

If the sun don't shine
If the wind don't break
If the clock don't jump off the wall
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall

I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair

Paul Simon,"Salvador, the afternoon sunlight is folding around us,
The dishes are done,
The buildings here, tall as our mountains 
Sliced through the windows and cut off the sun.

On such days I find I am longing for Puerto Rico
Though I never would return 'til you are free
But when I hear the Aguinaldo my heart's a little lighter
And we danced together Aurea and me

In my life I've been unlucky with two husbands
Gumersindo liked his rum and women friends
Then that hypocrite who beat you and preached about repentance 
Has gone, and so another Sunday ends

And tomorrow is another hard working Monday
I'm still hoping for the raise they promised me
There's a job as operator 
I would not have to wait for
If I could speak the language easily

But I tell Aurea
The barrio's boundaries are our own little nation
Sometimes I hear you run up stairs
And I view my light with resignation 
Keep your bible near you 
Time is an ocean of endless tears.",Sunday Afternoon
Paul Simon,"I speak to you in Jesus? name
As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can?t be blamed upon
Our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death row
To the shore 
I have stumbled through silvery waters to my saviour,
My Salvador

Salvador

It took me for years to learn
I was in prison not in church,
And two more to begin the book of my soul?s search

Sal & Salvador

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Sal

A wild boy from the streets of the barrio
The orphan form the hill of mayaguez

Salvador

And when I wrote my story 
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage

Sal & salvador

Time is anocean of endless tears

Sal

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write i?ll be transferred
Far away,
I?m leaving greenhaven?s towers of stone
Where the latin population will soon be minus one.

Sal & salvador

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Sal

I know how hard it?s been for you these many years,
You say the aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at el malecon
Go back don?t you worry, I am your grown-up son.

Salvador

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state

Salvador correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
A policy of race

Sal
A forest and a prison
Where the snow and the guards are white

Salvador

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

Salvador

You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and battered
From the streets I left behind,

Sal

I'll take the evil in me
And turn it into good,
Though all your institutions
Never thought I could
So now I turn to say goodbye

Salvador

I'll keep your image in my eye

Sal & Salvador

I turned around to say goodbye

Sal, Esmeralda & Salvador

I'll keep your image with me till the day I die.

Paul Simon,"A passenger traveling quietly conceals himself
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Over the crest of the mountains the moon
Begins its climb

And he wakes to find he's in rolling farm land

The farmer sleeps against his wife
He wonders what their life must be
A trailways bus is heading south into
Washington, D.C.

A mother and child, the baby maybe two
Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding
The shadow of the capitol dome
Slides across his face
And his heart is racing with the urge to
Freedom
The father motionless as stone
A shepherd resting with his flock
The trailways bus is turning west
Dallas via Little Rock

Oh my darling darling Sal
The desert moon is my witness
I've no money to come east
But I know you'll soon be here

We pull into downtown Dallas by the
Sight of the grassy knoll
Where the leader fell and a town was broken
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken

The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus
Any aliens here you better check with us
How about you son you like you've got
Spanish blood
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood

Yes I am an alien from Mars
I come to earth from outer space
And if I traveled my whole life
You guys would still be on my case
You guys would still be on my case

But he can't leave his fears behind
He recalls each fatal thrust
The screams are carried by the wind

I couldn't be sure
But the sin of impatience
Said â??She's just what you're looking forâ??

I introduced myself as Frank
From New York New York
She's so hot
She's so cool
I'm not
I'm just a fool in love with darling Lorraine

All my life I've been a wanderer
Not really, I mostly lived near my parents' home
Anyway Lorraine and I got married
And the usual marriage stuff
Then one day she says to me
From out of the blue
Frank, I've had enough
Romance is a heart breaker
I'm not meant to be a homemaker
And I'm tired of being darling Lorraine

What, you don't love me anymore?
What, you're walking out the door?
What, you don't like the way I chew?

You're not the woman that I wed
You say you're depressed but you're not
You just like to stay in bed
I don't need you darling Lorraine

I long for your love

Financially speaking
I guess I'm a washout
Everybody's buy and sell
And sell and buy and
And that's what the whole thing's all about
If it had not been for Lorraine
I'd have left here long ago
I should have been a musician
I love the piano
She's so light
She's so free
I'm tight, well, that's me
But I feel so good
With darling Lorraine

On Christmas morning Frank awakes
To find Lorraine has made a stack of pancakes
They watch the television, husband and wife
All afternoon â??It's A Wonderful Lifeâ??

What, you don't love me anymore?
What, you're walking out the door?
What, you don't like the way I chew?

But the news wasn't good

Please don't leave me yet
I know you're in pain
Pain you can't forget
Your breathing is like an echo of our love
Maybe I'll go down to the corner store
And buy us something sweet
Here's an extra blanket honey

Of peace without illusions

That you're not good enough
Well the answer is

The other half sucked all the moisture from the clouds
And we, we were amazed at the power of his appetite

Paul Simon,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders

Paul Simon,"A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
But I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",I Am a Rock [DVD]
Paul Simon,"I was reading a magazine 
And thinking of a rock and roll song 
The year was 1954 
And I hadn't been playing that long 
When a man came on the radio 
And this is what he said 
He said I hate to break it 
To his fans 
But Johnny Ace is dead 
 
Well, I really wasn't 
Such a Johnny Ace fan 
But I felt bad all the same 
So I sent away for his photograph 
And I waited till it came 
It came all the way from Texas 
With a sad and simple face 
And they signed it on the bottom 
From the Late Great Johnny Ace 
 
It was the year of the Beatles 
It was the year of the Stones 
It was 1964 
I was living in London 
With the girl from the summer before 
It was the year of the Beatles 
It was the year of the Stones 
A year after J.F.K. 
We were staying up all night 
And giving the days away 
And the music was flowing 
Amazing 
And blowing my way 
 
On a cold December evening 
I was walking through the Christmas tide 
When a stranger came up and asked me 
If I'd heard John Lennon had died 
And the two of us 
Went to this bar 
And we stayed to close the place 
And every song we played 
Was for the Late Great Johnny Ace",The Late Great Johnny Ace [DVD]
Paul Simon,"On the morning of her wedding day
When no one was awake
She drove across the border
Leaving all the yellow roses on her wedding cake
Her mother's tears, her breakfast order

She's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment, a chip in time
When leaving home is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see
Another life, another galaxy

That night her dreams are storm-tossed as a willow
She hears the clouds
She sees the eye of a hurricane
As it sweeps across her island pillow

But she's gone, gone, gone

There is a moment, a chip in time
When leaving home is the lesser crime
When your eyes are blind with tears
But your heart can see

He had a little bit too much fun
Now his head's erased

Thought we'd name her Emily

Paul Simon,"Locked in a struggle for the right combination of words in a melody line
I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine

But if I ever get back to the twentieth century
Guess I'll have to pay off some debts
Open the book of my vanishing memory
With its catalogue of regrets
Stand up for the deeds I did
And those I didn't do
Sit down, shut up, think about God
And wait for the hour of my rescue

We don't mean to mess things up
But mess them up we do
And then it's ""Oh, I'm sorry""
Here's a smiling photograph of love it was new
At a birthday party

Make a wish and close your eyes: surprise, surprise, surprise.

Early December, and brown as a sparrow
Frost creeping over the pond
I shoot a thought into the future
And it flies like an arrow
Through my lifetime, and beyond

If I ever come back as a tree, or a crow
Or even the wind-blown dust
Find me on the ancient road in the song when the wires are hushed
Hurry on and remember me, as I'll remember you
Far above the golden clouds, the darkness vibrates

The waters receded, the mountains were formed
""The universe loves a drama,"" you know
And ladies and gentlemen this is the show

The broker informed me I'm broke
I was dealing my last hand of poker
My cards were useless as smoke

Oh, guardian angel
Don't taunt me like this, on a clear summer evening as soft as a kiss
My children are laughing, not a whisper of care
My love is brushing her long chestnut hair
I don't believe a heart can be filled to the brim
Then vanish like mist as though life were a whim

Maybe the heart is part of the mist
And that's all that there is or could ever exist
Maybe and maybe and maybe some more
Maybe's the exit that I'm looking for

I got a call from my broker
The broker said he was mistaken
Maybe some virus or brokerage joke
And he hopes that my faith isn't shaken

Outta here
How am I gonna get outta here?
I'm thinking outta here
When am I gonna get outta here?
And when will I cash in my lottery ticket
And bury my past with my burdens and strife?
I want to shake every limb in the garden of Eden
And make every love the love of my life

I figure that once upon a time I was an ocean
But now I'm a mountain range
Something unstoppable set into motion
Nothing is different, but everything's changed

Found a room in the heart of the city, down by the bridge
Hot plate and TV and beer in the fridge
But I'm easy, I'm open, that's my gift
I can flow with the traffic, I can drift with the drift
Home again?
Naw, never going home again
Think about home again?
I never think about home

But then comes a letter from home
The handwriting's fragile and strange
Something unstoppable set into motion
Nothing is different, but everything's changed

The light through the stained glass was cobalt and red
And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by haloes of golden thread

Got to follow the rule

It's a glorious day,
By the way how long you been dead?""

And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line
Just to glimpse the divine
What you think about that?

Well it seems like our fate to suffer
And wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line
No one here, likes a sneak

It's hard to be grateful when you're out of control

Free from the shackles of time
Evil is darkness, sight without sight
A demon that feeds on the mind

Big Bang
That's a joke that I made up
Once when I had eons to kill
You know, most folks
They don't get when I'm joking
Well, maybe someday they will

Love me
Love me
That's the main request I receive
Well you know I love all my children
And it tears me up when I leave

But sometimes you gotta fly down that highway
Free as a bird, knock on wood, thank the Lord
I am driving along in my automobile
It's a brand new pre-owned '96 Ford

Check out the radio, pop music station
That don't sound like my music to me
Talk show host, what's that boy's name?
Politics is ugly

At the end of the dial there's the gospel show
Maybe now I can exit and rest
There's a blizzard rolling down off the banks of Lake Michigan
Gonna cover the roads of the icy Midwest

Paul Simon,"A pilgrim on a pilgrimage
Walked across the Brooklyn Bridge
His sneakers torn
In the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets
And the new day is born

Folded in his backpack pocket
The questions that he copied from his heart
Who am I in this lonely world?
And where will I make my bed tonight?
When twilight turns to dark

Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
Fools do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world

If you shop for love in a bargain store
And you don't get what you are bargain for
Can you get your money back?
If an empty train in a railway station
Calls you to its destination
Can you choose another track?

Will I wake up from these violent dreams?
With my hair as white as the morning moon?

Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
I do
Fools and pilgrims all over the world

Downtown Brooklyn
The pilgrim is passing a billboard
And catches his eyes
It's Jay-Z
He's got a kid on each knee
He is wearing clothes that he wants us to try

If every human on the planet
And all the buildings on it
Should disappear
Would a zebra grazing in the African Savannah
Care enough to share one zebra tear?

Paul Simon,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders 
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
And cut him till he cried out 
In his anger and his shame, 
""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
But the fighter still remains

Paul Simon,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while i was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams i walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light i saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""fools"" said i, ""you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that i might teach you,
Take my arms that i might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""the words of the prophets

And tenement halls.""

I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

Paul Simon,"Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover

Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I have to try

Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
There are times I find myself 
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime

Paul Smith,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again

Two friends, but one broken heart

Paul Smith,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go

High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland [DVD]
Paul Smith,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Paul Smith,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Paul Smith,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You
Paul Smith,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Paul Smith,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
Paul Smith,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me

Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.

Makes me stop before I begin

Paul Speckmann,"Lessons in might, lessons in stress
Teachings of right, reasons of less
Seekers of strength, only they guess
Will they proceed, or will they suppress
Frequent, illusive, you have the power to follow the one
Decisive, conclusive, the fall of the world has just begun
Wasteful, astounding, violence and force is the only way
Corrupted, misguided, we will lose thousands of people today
The fall of priest Hussein
Allah is to blame
Islamic fools of war
Soon will live no more
Ablative, abeyance, depriving the world with disruption of peace
Deceitful, fascists, holding the fate of the world in our hands
Harmonic, defiance, taking for granted the gift human life
Ironic, compliance, testing the fruits of their progressive toys
Will trade our blood for oil
Until our hands have been soiled
Civilians, pawns and kings
Will pay the penalty
The countdown of the endless problems
All the endless fools soon brought down
Never knowing where they've fallen
Has our Creator been calling
Countless bodies, piles of ashes
Severed mortar, wasteful clashes
Is the worth the whole disaster
Is the life, we're dying faster
Seasons of death, a game of chess
Leaders of pawns, where do they spawn
Just raised for war, to open the door
The door of demise, the deadly surprise

Paul Speckmann,"The streets and the cities
The alleys of woe
The forces of hatred
Are out of control
The lurk in the fields
Alone in the night
A sickly perversion, excursion
That's not in sight

He travels he streets
Different weapons in hand
He searches for victims
Befriends the demand
Ridding the world of
The homeless disease
Laughing out loudly
Ignoring their pleas
Victims of the chosen
Have been clearly marked and pushed aside
Many body parts were frozen
Simply just a waste of life
Eating the flesh of the virgins
The taste of blood
Picking the brains of desertion
Forever more
Stabbing the hearts of the weakened society
Killing the worthless for pleasure now
Raping the dead it's so silent
A twist of fate
A wave of sick violence
A question of give and take
Taxpayers earning just
Feed them the deathly row
The chair gathers dust
As they age in their cell
Documented murders often
Skip the press and go unsolved
Morbid visions, gross divisions
Multiply the cause of death
You fucking heathen!
Go back to hell, where you fucking came from!

Paul Speckmann,"Alcohol infested lives
In the night they seem to fly
Never ending road to death
Neveer near the home stretch
Lack of guidance, sudden trust
Will they soon forget the loss
Everyone's refuse to drive
Designit in charge of lives
Will they cross the final bridge
Will they parish in a ditch
Pull the plug, the right to drive a privalege
Stop the fools, don't override decision
Pull the plug, the right to die your option
He's the judge, allows this to continue
Best of all evils are never deprived
Consumed by the handfuls and ruining our lives
Violent cutback the system avoids
Protecting the children, from dangerous exploits
Buy a license from the state
Such a little price to pay
Drive them all to sudden death
Pull the plug and gain respect
",Pull the Plug
Paul Spencer Adkins,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart
As now they do, then

Younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Am I with you",Younger Than Springtime [From South Pacific]
Paul Stanley,"It's all about you!

I can't take it

I feel invincible when lying next to you

Paul Stanley,"Do you remember when you said I was the only one?
We'll watch the years go passing by
I never dreamed that with a love I thought had just begun
I'd ever hear you say goodbye

When we meet and I start smiling
And I'm just lying through my tears, baby

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Every time I see you around

I go to places but it's not the way it used to be
I only picture you and I
My friends all tell me I can push you from my memory
There's only so much I can try

When I touch your hand to greet you
I'm not sure that I'll let go, baby

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down
And it's all bittersweet, my heart skips a beat
Every time I see you

I find my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about you
How can somebody else take your place
I can't stand it

I find my way to a warm embrace
But I still think about you
How can somebody else take your place
When the things that I do bring me closer to you

When I say, I can't stand it, no
Do you remember when you said I was the only one?

Every time I see you with your arms around another
Every time my world comes crashing down

Paul Stanley,"You tell me what you want 
And you try to tell me what I need

You threw it all away when you were done 
You pray you found the chosen someone

You're gonna have to save yourself

You turn the world your way 
And you lose the truth within your lies 
But the feeling that you crave, money never buys

All the warnings come too late 
And your body starts to scream 
And if you think you see me in your dreams

No, it's not me

Was something real 
And now I'm haunted

Paul Stanley,"We both had stories, loves, and lifetimes before 
Left us wanting for more 
But it kept us on that journey 
With everyone we meet, we open the door 
There were others for sure, but they never got to know me

It's all a way to a life worth living 
So don't mistake what I'm givin'

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
Let me hear the words I'm sayin' 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through 
You might not be the first 
But for me your always second to none

Sometimes the fears we have will get in the way 
And the things that people say can make it so much harder 
The chance for love can look you right in the eye 
Yet it passes you by

So live a life with no happy ending 
But I won't lose it all pretending

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
Let me hear the words I'm sayin' 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through 
But for me your always second to none

Life has a way of making things brighter, lighter 
Don't throw it away, it takes a way to see clearly 
Believe me

It's all a way to a life worth living 
So don't mistake what I'm givin'

When every day is done I only wanna run to you 
When you're in trouble I will be the one to pull you through

All wrapped up in my own cocoon 
In my head I see you 
Like I'm stuck in a déja-vu

It's a dangerous situation, insane 
It's a warp on my soul and I've lost all control

[Chorus:]
When I'm all alone and I dream of you
I wake up, I wake up screaming 
9-1-1, no one hears my cries 
I break up, I wake up screaming

Why must I grieve 
For a lie that I still believe 
It's a waste, what a sin 
It's a fight I can never win

Anywhere that I go, you go 
Baby, even in my own reflection, you show 
Like a ghost by my side with a hold on my mind

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Paul Sundfor,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way
Paul Taylor,"We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We all wanna feel special...

This special need
That's within us
Brings out the best
Yet worst in us

Follow the passion
That's within you
Living the truth
Will set you free-ee-ee

To feel that we belong

Outside leave hate

Paul Taylor,"You go where you want
You do what you please
Never let on, that even once
That you've ever been lonely
It's nice to see you alone
Are you lookin' for somethin'
Maybe you ain't gettin' at home?
 
Your hair is in place
You're dressin' to kill
Your old man has promised
When he died he would leave you his money
And the pool where you swim
Are you lookin' for somethin'
Maybe you ain't gettin' from him?
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out
The day time queen takes a midnight ride
 
And it's plain as plain can be
You're a woman who wants to get free
If you're steppin' out tonight, honey,
Come on and step out with me
 
The party's a bore
It's bound to get worse
Let's sneak out somewhere
And engage in our own celebration
Will you pour me some wine?
Are you thinkin', baby, maybe
Your needs are the same as mine?
 
Wanna go for a walk,
Go for a ride,
Maybe just stand here and think
What we can do to each other
No, we don't have to dance
If you're thinkin' of steppin' out
Baby, this is your chance
 
Steppin' out, steppin' out
To get a little action on the side
Steppin' out, steppin' out

And she's jealous of me because she never could
Hold herself up without a spine
And she'll look me up when she's doing fine

Spoilt and ugly as she willingly slaughters
Friends and enemies they're all the same
They'll burn her name
And crush her fame

She'll break a promise as a matter of course
Because she thinks it's fun to have no remorse
She gets what she wants and then walks away
And she doesn't give a fuck what you might say

Because it cuts her up like Irish mortar
Mother's pride is what we taught her
Soiled and petty as we happily taunt her
Friend or enemy we're all to blame

She'll flaunt her flame                        
She'll make us remember, remember her name     

If she sits still like she knows she could
She could win this game and be the queen for good
Save herself up for the cream of the crop
Then she'll look us up when she's ready to stop

The traffic horns, the growing crowd
The sun awaking over central park

With concrete dreams stirring to life

The crowded skyline, the energy
The sleepless city always leaves its mark

Still wrapped in thoughts of love and wine

My dear, I wish I could hold you safe in my arms
From here to eternity

Alone I'll know you'll be waiting
When the moon beams lean down to kiss me
Cause your beauty burns through the darkness
Crystal and clear
From here to eternity

When I let go
When I release all my cares
Will you be there where the nightmare ends?
When I drift off
When the silver sun calls my name
Will you be there where the light begins?

The smallest drop in the ocean
Can start a wave of emotion
My dear, I wish I could hold you safe in my arms
From here to eternity

Alone I'll know you'll be waiting
When the moon beams lean down to kiss me
Cause your beauty burns through the darkness
Crystal and clear
From here to eternity",Eternity

You're what I can't live without

And never give up
When I'm falling apart
Your arms are always open wide
And your quick to forgive
When I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
Take off running and come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you

You're the light inside my eyes
Give me a reason to keep trying
Give me more than I could dream
And you bring me to my knees
You bring me to my knees

Your heart is gold and how am I the one
That you've chosen to love
I still can't believe that you're right next to me
After all that I've done

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Are passing fancies

And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

",I Wanna Get
Paul Wall,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I lived life hard 
Single mama with half a job, I was raised by God 
No dad, the only role model I had 
Was a ounce of that white powder, in a Ziplock bag 
I don't brag about the struggles, I endured as a child 
You don't know the pain I went through, to create this smile 
I got one life to live, know I'm tal'n bout 
So I enjoy it, cause I earned everything that I got 
They hate what I got, I hear em with they cape talk 
They thinking that my life, was a cake walk 
I'm a man of principles, I live by my word 
So it's obscured, when I hear sour words 
They gon get what they deserve, but I don't wish no harm 
What goes around comes around, so partna you been warned 
In the midst of all the trouble, I still remain calm 
Cause sunny days, will follow the storm man, just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

Somebody questioned, if I got the right to recite what I spit 
'Cause I've never been indicted, or divided a brick 
But my life is grit, all types of crisis and shit 
I decided to risk it all, to try to slide in the mix 
And get what I can get, see I'm fighting negative bars 
I knew it wouldn't be easy, but no one said it be hard 
As it is, I mean the evil in the heart of these men 
Got me wondering, if I'll ever see the reward 
At the end of the road, it's kind of hard to remember your goals 
When you grow where, not many live to get old 
I played the cards that I was given, and never listen to those

You breaking bread, what's up with it
I'm turning heads, when I enter the club
I'm Gucci this Fendi that, I'm all of the above

[Paul Wall]
When it comes to jewelry, I'm like T.J. Ford
Cause my diamonds, average bout 15 points
All my T.V. VS, nothing less than the best
So I guess, that means I got expensive breath
But I'm more than just jewelry, I'm more than just ice
But me looking like a scrub, just wouldn't safice
I got rolls gold glowing, lap tops showing
Bremie Louis the Thirteenth, to keep it flowing
I can keep going and going, but what's the use
You know I'm balling in the mix, cause I got the juice
I run with wise guys, so it's no surprise
Everywhere I go, women undress me with they eyes
Boys can't knock it, I'm on the rise like a rocket
Big bank take lil' bank, I let you pick which pocket
My wrist glowing, like I stuck my hand in a socket
It's Paul Wall can't nobody stop it, break bread

[Lew Hawk]
I'm a star stunning nigga, when I step in the club
Channel sets cross my wrist, just like a light bulb
Got Gucci cross my feet, while I shock and rock
Popping Crystal bottles, will make these hoes bop
We some top notch playas, ain't no time for acting
We need ATM machines, for the loot we stacking
Better think shoot a fee, I bet it won't break me
Plus I spend a few G's, up in VIP
It's the currency, that make these hoochies hunch
All they want is a hour fifty, take em out to lunch
But they must be drunk, I never trick off ends
Just flip a blue Benz, with the blue eyes lens
On 16 headed North, with my chrome girlfriend
She could make your life end, and not get sent to the Penn
This for my niggaz in the Penn, that won't see sunshine
Got princess cuts in my mouth, you could see sunshine, break bread

Jumping in the slab, I'm bound to turn heads
In something's blue red, running lights like the FED's
Man I feel like Pac, it's all eyes on me
Sitting on 23's, in the black SUV
A life of luxury, that's the life for me
You can catch me at the mall, spending 15 thee
On the piece and chain, got rocks and rings
Hoes attitudes changed, since I'm having thangs
It's hard to explain, but that's the way it goes
Over night I went from showing rocks, to rocking shows
Hoes that wouldn't speak, now they watching me
But I'm trying to figure out, is it the watch or me
Or the foreign car, with the blue eyed lens
It's a bird it's a plane, that's my made back Benz
Is we cutting or what, is what I'm asking her
In Texas she saw my chain, it's a massacre, break bread

As you get older thangs change. friends change people change it just how it go man-

chorus: I dunno if its jus me did I 

change did they change its messed up it'll never be the same let me tell you man its nothin like lyour bro today he love you tomorrow you don't know him no more
Verse 1: I got a lot of fish to fry but one thing I've learned is you can't teach a fish to fly kiss good bye 'cause on my team its every man for they self I'm jus tryin to do my best and play the cards I was dealt I reached out my hand for help but I was reachin in vain so I tightened up my belt and paid the price for this fame all playa's pay dues you ain't gon' hear me complain I started out wit lots of friends but only a few remain they say I changed but really I just matured and got smarter seems like the realer I get the more these boys get smaller when I'm around my own partners I sense envy and anger we'll recognize trill and all you boys is strangers

",Did I Change
Paul Wall,"[Chorus: x4]
Y'all don't know a thing, about my life
(my life) my life (my life)

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

[Chorus: x4]

In my life, I went from a straw hat to a crown
I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus: x4]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just want to be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggas, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains

But I ain't got no time for a little drama
I'm tryna pull out in drop top
Throw 22's on a lil' somethin' foreign for the summer
You can call me but I ain't gone answer
All this stress gone cause me cancer
Imma call up whodi in the club on and throw a couple dollars on a Dancer
So don't hastle me, just leave me alone, quit callin my phone
You say you an independent woman, then stand on ya own
Baby girl I'm gone, holla at me

I'm breaking bread with Mike Jones, and Slim Thug the Boss
It's Paul Wall, still representing Swishahouse
I'm with my boy Big Kaila, I don't bar no hater
I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later
Forget what they talking bout, I'm in love with my wealth
I ain't gotta say I'm true, cause true speak for itself baby

Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true
You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do
You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming Screw
Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true

Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true
You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do
You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming Screw
Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true

They say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you
If she's a dime tell her I'm fine, and she'll say true-true
Turn up the bang if you into, something color changing the rims do
Sound like a train cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo
And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like Al Bundy's hand
Believe me every time you see me, it's gon be in her pants
If I do a crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too
'Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you
Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt
'Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself
I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest
Have cyber sex with Cita, until you catch a virus
Why is he saying this, to piss boys off
I officially claim myself, the rap King of the South
The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you
And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ Screw, rest in peace

Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true
You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do
You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming Screw
Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true

Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true
You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do
You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming Screw
Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true

The definition of a pimp is (me), cause I ain't doing shit for (free)
I got my own label now, if you ain't heard it's (Clover G's)
Now me and Will chasing the scrill, we pulling up on chrome wheels
Nigga, your royalty check looking like my phone bill
Quick to capping picture snapping, paparazzi follow me
Yeah I'm platinum I'll slap him, if he smoke up all my weed
I love to speed on dubs and Spre's, bitches leave the club with me
Snitches mean mugging me, don't make me bust my fucking heat
We popping trunks and smoking blunts, that sticky-ickie (ooh-wee)
Last year I did a mill, now I'm bout to do (three)
I bring the heat on every track, it's five G's for every bar
Just because I'm in a Porsche box, don't mean I like the spa
That don't mean I like the car, you know I'm down to break your jaw
Just because I burn rubber, that don't mean I like the tar
We ghetto stars in every state, like Pimp and Bun we keep it trill
And if you ain't heard, it's Lil' Flipper and Chamill'

Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true
You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-I do

You jammed up and do no time we all above the law, 
Oh yeah them boys fly south we boys haul a bunch a raw

Paul Wall,"I'm ballin' baby (""big ballin'"")
Gridiron on the beat
Big house, big car
Hoes everywhere, ice everywhere, money everywhere
I'm ballin' man, I ain't braggin'
I'm just tellin' you what it is like, I'm ballin
Know'm talkin' bout? What up ?
I see you on the beat mo' betta

I'm comin' down, candy paint, sprayed by that Eddie
12 coats of that clear lookin' like some grape jelly
My paint's drippin' wet, my slab is superb
Park the truck and catchin' boppers down here in this dirty third
I hold it down for the block bleeders workin' overtime
Not concerned at all with petty shit, I'm occupied on the grind
I keep my mind on breakin' bread, makin' chess moevs, thinkin' ahead
I soaked up game at a early age, I'm built for this, I'ma seasoned vet
Swangers symbolize respect, cain't just anybody tip on Vogues
They'll catch you slippin' in the turnin' lane, and leave ya ass naked walkin home
Candy on chrome is how I drive, with screens fallin' in the back of the ride
My music screwed and my drank is purple, go and take a sip I'd be obliged
I'm comin straight from the land of the fry, the city of syrup and the home of Screw
I'm on the block with my potnah Gooch, stashin' cash in my Reebok shoe
What that do I can't complain, the candy gloss drippin' off the frame
Ball in the mix I'm off the chain, it's goin' down H-Town

[Chorus: x4]
I'm big ballin' baby, yeah, and I'm spendin' cheese
I'm on my grind all day makin' money with ease

I'm grippin' on that wood grain, I'm sippin' on that good drank
I'm showin' love to every side and every neighborhood man
I got them neon lights glowin', representin' my block
I'm on that 59 South, ridin' with my trunk popped
From that Homestead to that Spice Lane, I'm on Scott, in the turning lane
I'm headed straight to that Timmy Chan's, order up and let's get some wings
New Hawk on that channel, I'm on that dolly right
On the way to my gran-ty house, I'm navigated by bubble lights
I'm teded by that junior, I'm cut up by White Mike
Busted up by that Mr. Davis, sluggin' me is a beautiful night
That chrome is quite atrocious, complimented by candy gloss
I'm tiptoein on fo' swangers, eighty-fo's like Randy Moss
Open mouth and show platinum grill, it's like a disco ball
I got expensive tastes, courtesy of expensive jaws
They see me comin' grill and woman, truck bumpin
Knockin' pictures off the wall is nothin' cause I'm a baller

[Chorus]

When the speakers start bumpin' and that fifth relax
I make the trunk dance around like it's doin jumpin' jacks
I'm ridin' on them Spyders, them eighty-fo's tiptoein'
And that trunk is exalted with them neon lights glowin
The candy paint's immaculate, drippin' wet up off the fender
Beat the block up like a boxer, chop the street up like a blender
I got the flat screens fallin' down from the ceiling
And the platinum mouthpiece with diamonds in the filling
I'm big ballin', grippin' grain, breakin' bread, I'm stackin' change
Gettin' money I'm havin' things with two commas, I can't complain
Drippin' candy paint, off the frame, switchin' lanes
In the turning lane leavin' stains, cause I'm a baller

[Chorus]",Big Ballin'
Paul Wall,"Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

It started off, we were two peas in the pod
Motivated by love with the blessings of God
We were head over heels in this love thing
Funny ain't it thinkin' back, our friends thought it was just a fling
I used to call you on the phone, late night tip
Mackin' to you in your ear, conversation well equipped
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
But all the while your roommates were in denial
We felt a lot of jealousy from the very start
Your so-called friends kept tryin to tear us apart
They used to tell you all kinda lies
Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise
They transformed all your smiles into tears
To sabotage your happiness and blamed it on my busy career
I gave you e'rythang, aimin' to please
But I guess it wasn't enough, cause now you ready to leave
But don't go baby

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

Lil' momma been down with me for a while
When you tryin' to smile I'm the one you like to dial
But lately I've been on a mission for commission
So while you at home wishin' you was with me I've been missin'
But listen I'm tryin' to lace you up with diamonds that glisten
I got a vision so baby you need to kill all the fiction
Don't listen to what your friends sayin', they just jealous
'Cause they on the sidelines watchin' while you in the game playin'
I'm just sayin' you should be stayin', but I ain't trippin'
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin'
You know I got you on my mind like an edge up
And all of your naggin' me and whinin' it got me fed up
I'm on the grind hustlin', stackin' my cash
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin' after some ass
Tryin' to break that bread, I'm tryin' to get that cake
But you complainin' talkin' 'bout you fin' to skate, baby what it do

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

I'm tryin' to tell you 'bout your friends hatin'
While they be over there complainin' I'm just on my grind paper chasin'
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
But instead of chasin' hoes I be overtime on my grind
You steady listenin' to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anything to take yo' place
'Cause every time I come around they be givin' me that sex face
You ridin' shotgun in the James Bond Benz
With the frog-eyed lens on them 20 inch do rims
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I'm just on my grind tryin' to stack me up some ends baby
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
And all the while your jealous friends been in denial
I ain't askin' much, lil' momma just keep it real
Either you're down with me or not, baby what's the deal

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how

I never leave home without the heater

I'm strapped up like a straightjacket

Hit ya jaw and play 32 pick up
Catch a cut when the AK hiccup

Bend the corner bitch move around
I'll know ya head right by ya edge-up
Seen ya straight to Ben Taub, emergency room, ICU
And have you layin' up for a month
Eatin' ya dinner food through a tube

Why these suckers eyein' me, you don't wanna be tryin' me

Do's open, do's close, where's the camera I'll strike a pose
I'm still ridin' on elbows, in eighty-threes and eighty-fo's
The gangsta slab is what I flip, wood grain is what I grip
That purple drank is what I sip, in my cell phone keep a chip
I'm talkin' bid'ness I put it down, I'm choppin' blades and I'm poppin' shrooms
I'm from the land of that fry smoke, got plex I got the pump
Weighted trunk and chunk the deuce, keep it movin' I'm on the prowl
I'm on the hunt for some one night love, best believe that it's goin' down
Money and hoes, cars and clothes, diamond rings and ice grills

We put them 47 inch jelly screens in them Escalade
We po' that purple drank straight up like it's that Kool-Aid
We like them girls that eat it up and never be afraid
While you cry but ask how they givin' up the fade
Ye ain't got screens if they ain't touch screen
with the removable screen, lookin' mean on the scene
When hoes see me they sayin' everybody ain't able
Cause I turned the back of my Caddy pickup into a pool table

See a lil' freak, run some game, and she goin' I'ma take some brain
I'm on the slab, posted up, white Cadillac with the white guts
I'm on the scene, drankin' lean, mixed with Spire in a plastic cup
I'm from the hood, call it North, where Project Pat went to jail and court
But now he back on the Southern bricks, we gon' drink a lot and players smoke Newport
Uptown, hit the blush, or watch these diamonds blind you up
Nothin' but self-made millionaires so you corporate folks can shut the fuck

I got a deep freezer up on my neck and snow cones up in my ear
A ice tray up in my mouth, I'm lookin' somethin' like a chandelier
You can call me the ice man, I cause a blizzard every time I breathe
Posted up on that South Lee, with Big Mix and my boy Lil' Heat
Where's the drank I'm runnin' low, Cabbage Head told me it's a drought
But not to worry dough never doubt, I'll go to the doctor with a cough
It's Paul Wall baby that's my name, fly like a plane what it do
I drop the top of my potnah plaque and chunk the deuce to that boy Gooch
Just like a midget I'm sittin' low, and like a snail I'm crawlin' slow
Where's Mike, where's Bawdy, he on the grind ducked on the low
Yeah I like my music slow, yeah I like my train mud
I'm chopped up by Michael Watts, it's Paul Wall baby that's what's up

She told me when I come to her town, to hit her up and it's goin' down
She e-mailed me this old picture before she had her baby boy
I was ready to pay her a visit, she used to look like Ke-Toi
But, one too many Almond Joys, I went and seen this girl in person
But when that big {bitch} opened the door I damn near started cryin' and cursin'
(Damn) Just too many mega bites and, not enough roadrunner
But big girls need love too, so I beat it up like Royal Rumble
Shit, lil' momma looked like a whale she broke the scale
I told her baby I gotta bail, I won't tell if you won't tell
What the hell, the first minute I got in range of the nearest Dell
I changed my screen name and my number, this internet pimpin still prevails

Tryin' to find a computer check with a web cam that'll make a flick
Hit me up on that AOL, Instant Messenger what it do
My D-S-L is fast as lightning on the hunt for this mooshu
You got some potnahs that's just like you? Call your crew and I'll call mine too
Just take a look at my hit count, this internet pimpin' thing ain't new

Paul Wall,"Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
It ain't easy bein' the People's Champ
It's the new me, new me, new me, new me,
True, a lot of struggles I done been through and still goin' through
Let me show you what it's like to be me (Paul Wall, Paul Wall baby)

I'm not your average guy, I'm more than meets the eye
I know I'm friendly and fly, but let me tell you why
I was abandoned at an early age
My daddy was a dope fiend, I ain't seen him since the second grade
I sing the same song, deadbeat dad, single mom
I was always in the crawl, yet and still I was alone
I kept my faith in God, even in my younger days
I gave my life to Christ, got down on my knees and prayed
And God answered our prayers and momma remarried
All the burdens she carried, I must admit that it was scary
Somehow I got a real man as my father figure
Thangs started gettin better for my momma and my sister
Pain took me from a boy to a man
I knew I'd make it to the end if I could stick to the plan
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]
See I've been doin this here for a while
Eventually y'all boys gon' respect me dog
I'm Paul Wall - until it's over I'ma ball 'til I fall
I'm the greatest in a minute ch'all
Let me tell you if you knew me (knew me) yeah the true me (true me)
Not the glamour and glitz that y'all do see (do see)
I'm just a regular G, I gotta do me (do me)
I'm 'bout to introduce y'all boys to the new me, c'mon

It's more to me than all this glamor and glitz
I spent my whole life broke, I'm just tryin' to get rich
I kept it real all my life, I never stepped on toes
But somehow my friends keep turnin' into my foes
My ex keep callin' me, but I don't wanna talk to her
So then she call the laws on me like I'm the one stalkin' her
My new girl say I don't love her enough
But all the hatin' friends jealous cause I love her too much
I'm drinkin' bottles of Patron tryin' to drink away my troubles
But bein' an alcoholic only make things double
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me, Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]

You think you know me man? But you don't know me mayne
Just because you shake my hand don't mean that you my homey mayne
It's people prayin' on my downfall
And I can't understand why, cause I show love to alla y'all
People are grateful for the favors you show 'em
But when they need you for another one they still act like you owe 'em
Everybody be takin' credit for somethin' they ain't do
But you need to quit reachin' and stand on your own two
I always stayed humble, I never once changed
I never got a ego or a big head cause of fame
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me, Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]

I'm Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
But it ain't easy bein' me
I done put in my fair share of work, blood, sweat, and tears, for real
Passin' out flowers at the club
Doin' freestyles that don't go on mixtapes
I ain't understand it then but, now I understand it
It's a bigger picture than just what you think
You gotta think outside the box and try to make it
It's chess moves, not checkers baby",Just Paul Wall
Paul Wall,"Ah they shouldn't a done this right here

I'm grinding
I'm posted up on the block like a stop sign
Raised off of instinct with a mind like Einstein
I'm a certified hustler and a G
Trying to metamorphosize a hundred two a hundred three
I'm chasing after currency and accumulating green
With the heart of a lion, I'm on the grind like a dope feign
I've got the street smarts of Avon Barksdale
I took a couple hits but I'm still flowing like blood cells
My money's epidemic, it multiply fast
I'm grinding in the cut like a piece of broken glass
Addicted to the hustle allergic to being broke
Never falling off cuz I stay on my note

You gotta march like a soldier (now all my hot boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the hot girls dipping)

Hey, get off my dick, Hollygroove Weezy
Young money billionaire, Hermes winter ware
I'm trying to get somewhere like I ain't never been no where
They probably suffocate trying to breathe this endo air
Halt who goes there, nigga I live there
I run on top of water, I walk on thin air
I ride around with a MAC10 squared
That's a pair of semi-automatic shooting everywhere
I don't care if authority come by here
They get it just like them niggaz who ain't from by here
Yeah, and I'm extra bout it
If I get in beef I do something about it before I get out
Yeah, Lil Wayne never dropped the Lil
I gave Paul a hundred thousand for my grill
Yeah, I'm so New Orleans that I can't hide
You know I'm cutting something I'm spitting peroxide, Weezy

You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)
You gotta march like a soldier (now all my dope boys march)
You gotta walk it like you talk it (we got the dope girls dipping)

I ain't never had a hand, I ain't never been a beggar
On the grind like a bootlegger, I'm a go getter
I'm Bobby Fischer on the mic making chess moves
This suckers playing checkers simply destined to lose
The Martha Stewart made it blind
See the chains bump ends
Me and a couple lady friends blowing piff in the wind
I got the wrist ware, smooth and sleek
Nothing but ?
You ain't never saw a watch like this so go ahead and take a peek
I'm massive in the streets like a diesel truck
Indulging in that purple stuff getting full of that puff puff
Tote the iron, I'm double dutch
I'm ice water up in the clutch
Place your bet, I'll call ya bluff

I put it down on that Gov Bang, but now I reside on that South Lee
And I'm hustlin, on the grind, seventy-two, I was straight
No time to eat or sleep, I'm stackin' licks that just won't wait
I'm campaignin' for a Benz, on the rims with bubble lens
So I'm stackin' every dollar I see, hundreds, fifties, twenties and tens
Do's open and do's close, never sweat hoes, players get chose
Hustle and flow, cars close, that's the player life that I know

I'm ridin' drop-top on them roller skates, candy Charlie ranchin' paint
Enjoyin' the spoils of hard work, in grind mode tryin' to get that bank
I don't know what these boys thank, my motivation is Benjamin Franklin
I'm tryin' to maintain this wealth that I been calculatin'
Gettin' money that's all I know, on my toes never off my note
Wood grain and hundred spokes, I weigh the trunk just like a pro
I grind it's off to work I go, I hustle hard it's non-stop
And if I flop I switch the hustle, I learn the game and then set-up shop
I'm strivin' to make it to the top, it's all or nothin' no turnin' back
I'm with them boys out on the block, accumulatin' them paper stacks
I'm makin' money it's where it's at, whatever it takes, crackerjack
In love with my money and that's a fact and we still ridin' dirty pimpin'

Right now we got the fifth wheel reclinin'
Trunk is popped up, screens fallin' from the sky
I got the candy paint sprayed by Eddie
And I'm ridin' on that glassy chrome, all courtesy of my hustle game,
Be a hustler's in my bloodline, I don't complain or whine
I just get on my grind, puttin' in work overtime
I learned overtime, many hustles of every kind
Whatever it takes to make a dime, I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind, but now I see the road to riches
It's a long road, full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Benard Freeman taught me to keep it movin' when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me to keep it trill at all cost
I peeped game from the best, and since then I been playin' chess
I put in work with no rest, to get that paper that's my quest
I'm on a slow grind towards success, one of the best cause I keep it fresh
I'm one hundred and nothin' less and I'm still ridin' dirty pimpin'

Sippin' tha barre
Grippin' tha grain 
I got 17 karats in my piece and chain [repeat 4x]
[Verse 1:]
Now open a map and take a trip down south
Come on over to Houston Texas welcome to the Swisha House
It's the land of the trill
I'm coming live from the block
I got my mind on my hustle
I'm tyrna make it to the top
So I put in work and stack at night
Determination is all I got
On the grind I scheme and plot
Whatever it takes to raise my stock
I'm breaking bread out here trying to survive
I'm under water with these sharks praying that I stay alive
I'm putting up numbers like Garnet on that 610 south
Ain't nothing soft about my block except the packs of the south
This here's that Peoples Champ talk
It's the expressions of a G
And I'ma be chasing after them g's until I R.I.P.
Its Paul Wall baby 
What it do? Been banging Screw since '92
Fat Pat n Lil Kee Kee, Phunky Hawk and the rest of the crew
So who's next with the plex?
I'm flipping slab and waving hood
With screens hanging down from the roof 
I'm ballin' like a true playa should, I'mâ?¦
[Chorus x4]
[Verse 2:]
They got you thinking Houston Texas the home of David Carr
But really its candy paint playas sippin' on barre
Come take a ride wit a star straight outta that lone star state
Where Michael Watts trained and told me I gotta hold my weight
That motivation is the key when you moving them keys
Entrepreneurs up in the game outta the 713
See one of the keys to my success 
I switched up like Greg Mattix
While maintaining my composure to become one of the baddest
I stick to the G-code in my Algiers clothes
While I'm tippin' on 4 4 's with these suicide doors
I buy dro and pour a 4 for my dogs that died in the past
Praying to God I stay afloat just to make this hustle last
Its prime time I'm obeying the laws
While my life is on trial
I'm tryna knockout piece and chain and throw some ice on my smile
Its all work and no play I'm out here punching that clock
Its hustle mania out here grinding on the block I'm tryna ball baby
[Chorus x4]
[Verse 3:]
From the third coast trenches where the killers don't think
Where them boys be slugged up and tatted up with that ink
These lil cowards tryna assassinate the character of a G
But I'm squashing all of that chatter keeping it real and being me
Its G's up and marks down when I'm making my round
I'm up in NYC with Dipset and we shutting it down
Shouts out to King and Martin holding it down in the low post
While I'm on the block grinding tryna hold my post
I'm glass house on the grill my necklace glow like toxic waste
I'm iced out like frozen food
Sippin' on the ski taste
I'm over time on that grind
It ain't no time for playing games
That's why I hustle 25/8 accumulating this change
I got them diamonds up against that wood grippin' grain and sippin' good
Hustle Time that's my hood getting money is understood
I'm on the hustle baby all night and all day
100 thee up in my safe
It's safe to say that boy is paid

In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow

A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills

Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a Styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping

And we take a hater's pounds
And we sell a hater's bricks

Somebody tell them that they're rockin' Houston

And all my real bitches step up come to wipe a player down smoke a pound with him
Real niggas step up we gon gun 'em haters down come around you hear that
And all my real bitches step up come to wipe a player down smoke a pound with him

I hear these haters talking seem like they're getting louder
These sweet cupcakes softer than some clam chowder
I'm from the city to proudly serve crack rocks?
For twenty dollars get you higher than an astronaut
I keep a Glock in my state prop jeans
Floating on cloud nine goin' off codiene
I chuck a deuce to a hater
I'm on a mission for paper
I got Lil' Hawk with me serving dope fiends like a waiter
I'm on the south B with my boy do you
Big bank take little bank baby tell me what it do
These boys talking loud but they ain't saying a thang
But Paul Wall and Freeway will make 'em sang

[Chorus]

It's the Swishahouse state prop chain gang
.45 cal big Glock bang bang
I keep the Tupperware tucked in my underwear
Rain down thunder on these suckers make the clutter clear
Let's get one thing clear I run with grizzly bears
Bite you in your back and make you straighten out your chest hair
I'm 100 baby no time for playing games
I got a garden full of carats hanging in my chain
I keep a player bought my paper fuck a hater
Cause the real turn fake switching over like a cross fader
I'm squashing chatter climbing up the ladder
Cause my goal is to make my pockets fatter baby Paul Wall

[Chorus]",State to State
Paul Wall,"[Chorus]
Trill is when you're hustlin', trill is when you're grindin'
Trill is when you punch in that clock overtimin'
Trill is when you keep it real one hundred percent
And hold it down for your team run your game full sprint
Trill is when you never fake, trill is when you real
Chasin' after dollar bills, gotta get it how you live
Trill is when you hustle so you go out there and get it
Doin' whatever you gotta do to make a meal ticket

Yeah, I'm all about the cheese baby, all about the cheddar
When it come to ghetto grindin' can't nobody do it better
A real go-getter, never hesitate to hit a lick
I don't have to even make a phone cal to get a brick
Ya find lieutenant on ya Sidewalk Two
At code fo'-twenty-'fo, he know just what to do
Bring me two turkeys back like it's Thanksgiving
That's how we do in Texas my nigga, so how you livin'
Up in the game since the early 90's
Never sleep to keep them haters one step behind me
Ain't nothin' changed but the time that they hand out
But even without the cars and the ice, we stand out
Cause everybody know us in the streets, we like royalty
Commandin' respect and demandin' click loyalty
If you ain't down with freein' Pimp C then fuck all y'all
You wanna know what trill is? Tell 'em Paul Wall

[Chorus]

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I live by the code
In the city where greed and envy make ya heart turn cold
At 17 years old I was ahead of my time
I had to roll with the punches and keep my ducks in a line
I keep my mind on my money, I keep my mind on my paper
I keep a glock inside my pocket for all these jealous haters
I trained for chess moves, I'm five steaps ahead
I keep my mind focused, make money, break bread
I'm rollin' 5 9, it's the home of the crack sales
That South Lee block got more cookies than Snackwells
I snatch you up like eatin shrimp, don't contest do not attempt
You crossed the line no turnin' back, we'll leave you naked like Larry Flynt
With young ghetto stars, certified with ghetto scars
Intoxicated by weed cigars, we eat stress by sippin' barre
Fancy cars and diamond ice, I'm intrigued by fancy things
We always keep it trill, in the hood we look like kings

[Chorus]

Look, look, if you know me then you know I'm a G
If you know me then you know I'm gon' run through a hundred bricks a week
If you know me then you know I'm a dawg
If you know me then you know I get a package and I fly 'til it's gone
If you know me then you know I'm a fool
If you know me then you know I'll punish you if you fuck with the dude
If you know me then you know I'm a man
If you know me then you know I keep a plan to keep some money in my hand
If you know me then you know I'll bleed
You don't know me ask somebody they'll tell you wodie mean what he said
If I huff it, ain't no doubt I'm a spread
I'm a cock and bust, since 13 I been droppin' my nuts
I'm online for new artists in Florida
Got a bitch that'll drive with a package from Atlanta to Dallas
You ain't know, better ask your bitch
Paul Wall, Bun B, B.G. is as trill as it get

Paul Wall,"Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My homey Mali used to stay one 29th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin' 16 he was stuntin'
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lake shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
And there was a lot of flirting involved
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey

What It do
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunnk open screens on neon's lit with
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on a switch sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawlin' like a caterlippar
I'm tippin' on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do?

Drive slow homey
Turn your hard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today 'cause tomorrow you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live

And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow

Chopped and Screwed
Yeah
Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

Hold up
Self-employed so I'm paying me
Stayin' true 'cause it stay to be
Won't loud part candy captain then get a ticket then pay the V
Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me, 
How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God, 
All the rappers start calling Mace, 
Drop sounding like an earthquake, 
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they've been calling me, 
Soon they see me roll up, roll up
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up, 
Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

[Chorus]

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

I'm in town girl for just one night
You so fine girl you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight
We gone spend time, you name your price
I don't trick, but for you I might
Tryin' a get deep girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight

Open up ya eyes and ya see quite clear
No mo crying, no mo tears, cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off of ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl you in for a treat
The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, It'll make the misson complete
Your body language is loud, girl you speaking it well
But baby I do the fool, put you under my spell
I'm suave and debonair,You sexy wit long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, Your pot of gold is my goal
But baby let's take it slow, lemme show ya im real
If them looks could kill, ya be wanted in every state
Ya body shape is great, Collaboratin is fate
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make
I'm ready to back break, girl you wet as a lake
I can't wait

Go on and let ya hair down, you in the mist of a player
I'm the answer to ya prayers, we make a perfect pair
I handle with great care, I'm packing girl beware
Go one come back to my lair, and I'll make you believe
Some slow jams and candle light, make the mood right
I do it just like ya like it, sweat ya out of ya weave
From the second you arrive, to the moment you leave
I'll have you huffin' and puffin, but please don't forget to breathe
Ain't no tricks up my sleeve, but I know you still debatin'
But baby no more waitin', it's time for Mr. Slayton
Them other clowns been fakin', but I'm here for the takin'
No worries of baby makin, Cause I pack a Gary Payton
Me and you layin' naked, in them birthday suits
Is a result of body rockin', baby knockin' them boots
Now you know you lookin' cute, but it's time to decide
All playing games aside
You gone ride baby

[Chorus]

Get closer baby, tonight I'll give you what you need
From the moment that our eyes met, I knew that you're the one for me
I knew that we had chemistry
So tell me what it do tonight, I tryna leave wit you tonight
Cause your looking so nice

A bowl of strawberries, and some moet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of skin, 
I'm a demonstrate, what separate the boys from the men
Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion
Let's get full of that potion, and leave ya the broken
Baby it ain't no jokin', when I tell ya it's real
So baby tell me how ya feel, whats the deal baby

Chunk up tall, let the 4 screens fall,
Spider's crawl gon turn up that dial 
And make they heads all nod like a bobble head doll,
Bendin' corners up and down wayside,
From greens road to that Antoine drive,
Crew on da side playin' N-B-A live,
I'm too cool for school ridin' on buckhide,
Turnin' heads when I'm on dat scott
Hit that french's for a quick pit stop,
Boys in the mail talkin bout they on top,
8 Months later all them boys flop.
Like it or not I'm the game and 
I'm showin' up, keke got dat oil and we pourin' up,
Hit the club wit captain jack 
And big Steve representin' my hood still throwin' up.
Big money in the gang as the bread grow,
Candy old school drop top for the low,
Boys used to be sleepin on me but the champ 
Is here I guarantee that they ass woke,
Ridin' on spoke, dats the elbow, still rockin' in da ice white shell toe,
Dis for my boys by dat kelso and you already know.

But might see me on that five-8 comin' down,
All over the town I like to get around,
Jammin' my fat pat screwed up underground,
Comin' down in the lime green eighty eight,
While them boys on the sideline wanna hate,
Bump a kid for fuckin' up the state plate,
I Must admit my life's great,
T-Farris wit me in the snow bunny Benz,
Lookin' through a louey lens and we stackin' up ends,
Bros over hoes yea I'm talkin' bout friends,
Got freedom on my arm for my dog lil' twin,
Dubs on the rim that's t.i.s,
Just like pretty Todd I'm g-boy fresh,
Got oil comin' in and it's strait from da west,
And grill throwin' mesh on the cadillac crest,
Head of the best I ain't messin' wit da rest,
Santa clause sled that's pomegranate red,
Sippin' that taste I take it straight to da head,
And that swisha house is what I rep till I'm dead.

Tryin' to run up and jack my slab,
This one here for my boy lil kee I'm throwin' deuce up and gettin' boys dab,
Pourin' da juice up and grippin' that ab,
Wavein' hoods so the base showcase
Settin' the trends steady choppin' up wind with a diamond ice grin, that paper I chase,
Taper fade by that bad boy shop,
Tippin' slow I'm screwed up and chopped,
Listening to some of that bobby merl, them choppaholics, maybe that Michael Watts,
Choppin' the block up, holdin' a full cup,
Breakin' a strut, now I'm on them swangs,
Grill and woman popped trunk full of bang,
I'm third coast raised and I'm drippin' stains,
I'm hittin' stank tryin to break that bread,
Slowed and throwed till the day I'm diseased,
Leaning tuff, I got cup full of stuff with a starched crease and a johnny dang piece.

Full of that Kush flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a street light, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, mustard green Bentley coupe

Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that minute maid droppa', with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the two
The fifth wheel on the ground, and the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
Ma skills is so ill when workin' the wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Wide screen mind frame, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on dat Osama, baby leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two seater feeder, it's me and a senorita
3 ounces up in the liter, and it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park

I'm high as a ceiling fan, I'm flier than Superman
I'm hot as a frying pan, 'cause baby I'm the man
And I'm leanin' like a kick stand, stackin' up them grands
From T Wet to Batan, that wood grain up in my hand
Roll it up and pass it, as I cruise through traffic
Slow motion candy ocean on this antique classic
I'm super seedin' my quota, out collectin' these dimes
My speech slurred 'cause I'm leanin' like a half passed nine
I'm tippin' down on them craigers, I'm skatin' like Darren Harper
With a trunk full of speakers beatin' hard like Travis Barker
The money in the stash, paid for make stack

Them haters talkin' down, see him comin' up
I get money, stay true, get your paper up

It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse Spokesman
I'm crushing all competition like a coke can
I'm with that Damon Jones Mix-O and Black Lac
In that Lac with the trunk cracked, I'm swingin'
Until the swingers collapse, I'm back, I'm stuntin'
Comin' down on gold tires, I'm on the block, holdin' it down
Like some ? I keep the swingers pokin' I got the
Windows open, white cup with somethin' potent, wood wheel
Still what I'm chokin', I'm on that Antwan with Lou, Hawk, and
Freddie Thug, this small of ? is makin' their heads bop, that's
My job, my mind's on stackin' on what, these boys out here chasin'
Broads, look close it's no mirage, I got somethin' ballin' dawg

[Chorus]

I'm on the block holdin' posts like Jermaine O' Neal
No ice grill, just cold steel, that's a gangsta grill
I'm down for that drama so I'm known to pack a cannon
A sharp seein' hittin' targets like Peyton Manning
And you can catch me in the hood like a liquor store
Roll those dice, let's get that dough, I'm 6-8, I'm 10-4
I got that Tish from black, that tip got my back
I put them elbows under the Lac, and know they plottin' ta jack
Boppers don't know how to act, I'm leanin' back and countin' stacks
Postin' up on big wheels, still sippin' ? don't get distressed
I'm out here chasin' banks, breakin' bread and sippin' drank, accumulating
My Benz taste, my mind straight, and my paper chase

My vision's nocturnal so I'm grindin' all night
I gotta cup that's rather purple, so it's oil and it's Spirte
I got some partnas in the cage, I be shootin' them kites, them other
Guys is all hype, tell them suckas take a hike baby, you see them
? you see them hundred spokes, I'm holdin' spokes just wood
Deep, ya get it, coast to coast, I'm slabbin' candy drops, punchin' clocks
And slammin' broads, I got money like Reggie Bush, my billboard got a lotta
Yards, I'm with that Poppa Joe, I got dro on da low, I keep the lean for a month
Or so, but I'm back on it, I can't let go, I'm down with T.Farris and G.Dat, we

You could catch me ridin' in da lac, 
Top down, seat back, keepin' heat up on my lap,

Every hood that I'm in, white cup in my hand, 
Blowin' kush in the wind, I'm blowed (I'm blowed). 
Any day of the week, new grill, new piece, 
From my head to my feet, I'm cold (I'm cold). 
New shoes on my ride, bad bitch on my side, 
Man that's how gangstas roll (that's how gangstas roll).

I'm higher than a top flight, throwed like a splitter, 
My pockets keep gettin' bigga, cause I'm one bad figga. 
Boppas n gold diggas on the track at work, 
I'm hurtin' feelins in that Bens wit a deuce and a Squirt. 
I'm a fillibuster for hustlas, invadin' dem mark bustas. 
Leanin' like I'm on crutches as I ski taste slurp. 
Swangin' and woodworkin' convertin' this closed curtains, 
For certain, I betta not spill no purple drank on my shirt. 
I'm hustle for occupation, I'm grindin' paper chasin, 
These boys is steady hatin' so this pistol I'm embracin'. 
That lac is so amasin' and da elbows is skatin'. 
Cranker wires n vogue tires, one hell of collaboration.

Banana clip for them snitches tryin' to monkey wrench my pimpin'. 
Neva been caught slippin' cause that glock I hold,

Wavin' trunk on dem punks, act a fool, 
Tippin' paint, drippin' wet, like a pool, 
Breakin' brews, neck cool, it's full of jewels. 
Rumor is that them jackas on da sideline schemin' and plottin'. 
But my mind on dem boppas if I spot'em I got 'em. 
I got slabs I got foreigns wit da seats all plush, 
I got brandy wine gloss, baby please don't touch. 
I got 20's I got 4's I got screens and such. 
Boppas yappin' cause they say I tend to cap too much. 
I got starch in my jeans and da crease so sharp. 
Headlights on my ear when the night get dark, 
White ones on my toes brand new out the box. 
Interior decoratin' the watch I'm connectin' the dots. 
I got stocks I got money that's a fat billfold, 
Now let me tell ya how I roll come on

This new outbreak in Houston is out of hand for sure.

Look close there's no denyin' them boys softer than fur. 
Killa kush smoke I blow as the lungs inhale, 
Gangsta leanin' on dat oil I got a story to tell. 
Laws trippin' when they see me askin' ""what's that smell"", 
Raw fed exed me some x pills we call it e mail. 
Lights camera action I'm the shit and I show it, 
A young gangsta hood boy, so fly and I know it. 
Steady breakin' boys off, 
5 karats in earlobes givin' somethin' that you can feel,

Impeccable with this pen I got somethin' to say.

And a bag a sticky icky green limes

I got that paper in them rubber bands stacked up
And I got somethin' hidden in the stash wrapped up
If you see purple in my cup that mean I'm leanin' tough
I got them haters on my back so I be strapped up
I'm in a league of my own while them haters throw stones
But my mind on cash I'm in the zone I'm grippin' wood and tippin' chrome
I'm well known my wrist is rocky like Stallone
Southlea is where I Rome
The champ is here and there is no clone
Off top I'm well respected on many blocks
So I'm pullin' hundreds and smashin' cocks
Knockin' these broads up out they socks
I'm in the hood like wig shops
Look close I ain't hard to spot
I'm right there at that gamblin' spot
Stackin' up a fat not

Talkin' shit like brother lane
These boys talkin' down on the name

But they all washed up like Eddie Kane
The slab roof like David Blaine it disappear like magic
Glock nineteen made a plastic might stretch ya out jus' like elastic
I stay up on my toes till the day that my casket close
Bankrolls and fine hoes fancy cars and starch clothes
Weed cigars and Moet rolls pints a bar and kushy dro
Dime collector outside the club in candy toy with tha trunk exposed
Swishahouse baby that's my crew roll wit us or you'll get ran through
We loved by few and still true let me tell yall jus wat it do

And I been hustlin' since hulk hogan body slammed the iron sheek
My flo is outta sight but them boys is all hype
They cant see me up on tha mic
So they be hatin' me outta spite
Some potent purple sprite I done paid my dues
I hear the strong survive but the weak end up on fox news
Sleepless nights wit burna in hand cause now a days them jackas plot
Jealousy turn friends ta foes im packin' glocks around tha clock

Stackin' up that paper, pockets fatter than a dukie rope,
Boys lookin' sick, But that docta got that antidote,
Hatin' cause they broke suckers, fake as a 30 spoke.

I'm watchin the stock quotes, I'm real as a pac,
But these clowns be actin' funny, like a knock knock joke,
They cramp on my style, cause I got money and power,
My paper long as the nile, so how them hatas like me now?

Them bustas on the prow so I'm ten tokes down,

Some tattoos and a ice grill don't make you real,

It take money to make money I said,
So you gotta have dough to make bread where I'm From,
I ain't chew get it, I stay true with it,
Barbed wire flow, don't get tangled in it,

Real nigga yes, all about the hustle,
Till I get that call from god sayin,""I want you""
I been trough it, I past struggle, thats right,
Every day I in the street trying to complete a mad puzzle

Big money like I work downtown.

I'm one hundred, but them other boys frontin',
They just sideline commentating, we call it dumb fuckin',

You swear they so cool, but they turn like doorknobs,
They say they hardcore, but they friendlier than spongebob,
I'm tryin' to stay afloat, stayin' up on my note,
So that Highness is what I tote, affordin' the overcoat.

I roll with a platoon that'll put you in your tomb,
And then mark up your body like Mr. Cartoon,

Cause that hatin' around the clock, will it ever stop,
Probably not.

Comin' through with a hundred round supa soaker
Still suited in Joker, Scandalous in Cartoon
6 dudes wired, real sharp as a harpoon
I'm bowin' down, doin it I stay in the box
Steady ridin' dirty, steady duckin' the cops
I'm burned out, lit up. Maskin' my fears
Man it's hard to stay focused when they're blasting your peers.
I only fuck with real dealers and killers who really ride
Trust when they bust they're triggers. who really died?
They figure he really high, figure they're really right.
Figure not to dance, they figure he really might
Get it how you live, on the grind for mine.
Only roll with motherfuckers that are fine with dyin.
Got a mindless nine, keep it right under my front seat.
Lookin for no trouble. If it bubble we done beat.

When I pull up to the light, baby I'm a show stopper.
Boys talkin' down, need to start talkin' proper.
My security guard is an AK chopper.

I'm a juero pistolero with a fistful of metal
You fuckin with my perro, I'ma split your sombrero.
Treatin' enemies like elbows, gettin' em off me.
Got access to silencers, I'm killin' em softly

That oil got me sleepy, and jealous got me strapped
So I slide off in the Lac' with a Glock in my lap.
Still Sittin' Sideways, Caddy Corner on them thangs
Swangin' in and out the lane with some ice in my fang

Champagne Continental, Drank and diamond dental.
Got four old-schools with the help of a rental.
Get's mental off the oil with a touch of that sprite.
Two hundred dollar bliunts, homie who got the light?

Goin' and let me slide on in, ill beat it up but you wont be bruised
You playing hard to get, ain't nothing wrong with a little tease
You got one hell of a target, lil' mama I ain't a please
I'm coming with it hard, so gone and take what I got to give
Trust me now I play no games, I make you feel it inside yo ribs
Get ready fo hot sex, I bring the package like fed-ex
Under the sheets I'm so elite, come get a taste of this T.E.X.
I make that bed squeak, I'm well knowin' for laying the wood
Baby girl you got that good, my game plan is understood
Lay the pipe down just like a plumah, touch cha and make yo body shivah
Let me swing up inside yo rivah, lil' mama you got that fire

Girl you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Girl you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Girl you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Girl you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Boy you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Boy you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Boy you got that fire, that fire, that good shit
Boy you got that fire, that fire, that good shit",That Fire
Paul Wall,"When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast
I ain't never came through
Got a mouth full of diamonds
You can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it shine like dis (dis)
It's that H-Town, baby, and you know what is
I'm throwed
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Show Cali why I'm bangin' this crew
Ice Ice Man, baby, and you know what it do
I'm throwed

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Makin' that candy dance, I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm pressin' on his knee, crawlin' down like fire ants
I'm higher than a trance, I'm sharper than a star's pants
Stackin' Franklin and Grants from south bank to spring grass
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' Brandi wine on glass
I got a screen and a dash, a quarter tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass, throwed; I hope I don't crash
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird

Ice Ice Man, baby, and you know what it do

Now, to broads I'm a sharp-shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrists, 'cause a blur
Fox fur and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure
So I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number lil' momma 'cause it's checkout time
I'm slidin' on glass threes, inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
I'm cool as a ocean breeze; like Chester, I'm chasin' cheese
I'm stingin' like buzzin' bees, on softly with cheese
Screens fall like all them leaves, makes the TV's rain
Take a picture if you please; yeah, my wrist is insane
Dirty can, diamond chain, so fallin' is off the chain
Mind frame, I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast

I'm pourin' that purple sprite, and I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin' so my money stretch like extension chords
I'm a wide bod rocker in a four on them choppers
I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T Fair as my ace
Cup full of expensive taste, open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed up with screens hangin', swangin', breakin' his trust
We pourin' up in them cups; that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a softer pal out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers, makin' paper stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby
Holla at ya love, I'm throwed

Paul Wall,"[Paul Wall Intro]
I get up early and get it before the crack of dawn
And I'm still out when the sun set getting my hustle on
I'm grinding all day long to keep my paper long
I got my mind on paper chasing, my focus strong

Mind elevated, so my game is upgraded
Now its money in the pocketk all day like tom brady
And even when the weather outside gets cold
Ima stay on patrole to keep my bill fold swoll

[Chorus: Marty James]
Even when its cold outside, the sun got gutter
By the clouds in the sky, it stay hot like summer
I grind .... ooohhh ...
I still grind ... yeaaaahh...

Even when the well runs dry, I see my struggle
Ain't a day go by, that I don't hustle
I grind .... ooohhh ...
I still grind ... yeaaaahh...

[Verse 1]
The oven doors shut, but I still smell cake
The stench is too high, I ain't pumping my brakes
The paper is so large, it can change a man's faith
I with David Taylor every year changing the plates

See I wake up extra early just to bleed these streets
From Gut bank to Debrees tell em to gimme a piece
I got the bricks up on my tail just to fall in love
But we just whip em and toss em up like a ticket stub

They say money can't buy me love and that's true
But money can buy me drugs so I'm cool
10 dollars can buy the clipse slugs for these tools
That'll cock, and ready to let loose on these fools

[Chorus: Marty James]

[Paul Wall Insert]
Gotta get this money baby, all day ? all night
I'm breaking this bread, I'm stacking up this paper
Feel that, know what I'm talking about
Ima go getta

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
My money makes money my stocks are tripling
So I'm moving this paper like Dougie and Nicholas
Addicted to the hustle so the bread coming fast
I'm connected all across the state like Comcast

I bleeding I-10 like a gunshot wound
So I can knock off new beemer, that's gon come out next June
I ain't slept in bout a week so I'm high as the moon
I'm trying to make sure my money pile up like sand dune

[Chorus: Marty James]

Man I'm holding on, Man I'm holding on
I'm gon do it, I'm gon win it
Man I'm holding on, Man I'm holding on
I'm gon do it, I'm gon win it, again!

[Chorus: Marty James]
",I Grind
Paul Wall,"[Chorus: Kobe]
We out here, trying to get it rain or shine
Can't nobody take what's mine
But people say ...
""That they gon try to kill me""

Go hard for mine is all I know
I'm trying to get all this dough
I try to say ...
""If you want me come and get me""

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Early in the morning when the sun come up
I be playing my position, trying to chase a come up
I'm on the corner like little kids waiting for the school bus
I'm reggie bush about my paper man I gotta rush

I'm chasing Johnny dame, co vein with diamond crush
I want that TV Johnny watch, earrings and such
I got my mind focused driving in the fast lane
Apple paint and white seats, looking like a candy cane

I'm running marathons, while these lames running sprints
Been pulling all nighters, all year, and ever since
I'm steady grinding on the rise like Honda pants
Partner this is common sense, stacking up dollars and cents

I'm thinking pickett fence, six rooms, that's on a lake
Long as I keep stacking bread like pancakes
I pray with high stakes, so I can crawl down like snakes
Trying to eat them Vincent Anthony steaks, I gotta get more

[Chorus: Kobe]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
From a Buick to a Benz, the American Dream
Riding apple over silver with the insides cream
I got my mind on the foreign so I hustle some green
And I'm somewhat color struck 'cause I only love green

I'm living the ghetto dream, money, hoes, and cloths
My mind on bankrolls, I stay up on my toes
See I'm working for that paper chasing after that cash
Overtime punching clocks, I call it a monster mash

That paper in my vision, so I grind with precision
A hustler's ambition, to accumulate commission
My eyes is burning 'cause I ain't slept in bout a week
And there's no time to eat 'cause my body is weak

I'm {?} its time for cash stacking, there ain't no time for slacking
I'm recking money now, later I'll be Cadillac'n
I'm packing paper and my pockets over flowing to the top
That's why I'm blowing my dawg, I gotta get that money!

[Chorus: Kobe]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
The clock keep on ticking and the count down is on
My paper keep on stacking now it won't be long
I'm king kong of the hustle, using mind with muscle
Putting together plots and schemes like a piece to a puzzle

The boys chasing broads, but I'm out here stacking bars
Motivated my screw tapes that's in my ipod
My job is all night my hustle is all day
When you thrown in the game, there ain't no 401K

I got a dream like Dr. King {?}
I swing it like peter parker in the Cadillac
So now I'm changing up the game like a clinic bitch
Hood super star with dreams of getting rich, gimme more

[Chorus: Kobe]

Take a look at me.
Take a look at me now.
Take a look.


(Verse 1)
Once upon a time, not too long ago
Down in the great state of Texas where we live life slow
I was born amongst poverty, I had no dough
Motivated by a dream with some hustle and flow
My paper was never long but my ambition was strong
Followin Gods path, I could never go wrong
I took a road less traveled and I got a few scrapes
But the journey was all worth it just to get that cake
Mama told me I would make it, some fools just laughed
But I remembered how The Bible say ""The first shall be last.""
And even thought all the teams skipped over me in the draft
I ignored all the haters and perfected my craft
Times change, and nowadays to me it seem funny
The same people hatin, callin me up to borrow money
But I hold no grudge, I just forgave and forgot
I guess that's the reason I made it to the top
Take a look at me now...

(Hook)
Haters said that I would never get this paper
But Ima see my money regardless
Got the soul of a hustla
When it comes to gettin my bread...
...Im heartless
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now


(verse 2)
",Look at Me Now
Paul Wall,"(Paul Wall 1st Verse)
When you up, you up
And when you down, you down
But when you fall off
Just peep out who still come around
And ain't too many gon' hold you down
When you down and not on ya luck
But ima be right by your side
Even when that road get rough
I keep it cool when the streetz iz hott
And all your friends that soon forgot
They leavin you all alone to rott
But I'll be there till you back on top
I'm down wit ya wit no strings
No matter what, one hundred I'm willin to feed
I'm gettin that paper to feed my krew
And no matter what you goin through
I'm stayin true...

(Chorus)
(Z-Ro)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Z-ro 2nd Verse)
Uhh...
I represent Mo' City until the day I die
I speak the truth even when I say a lie
Even lil babys know better than to play with I
Would be to lost and never found to say bye bye
Ya'll already know I got a lot of evil in me
But I got a lot of that love shit too
'cause I promise I'm in love with my ride
And I'm in love with what its sittin on
Bitch and my paints so blue
Thanks to Paul Wall
You already know I got love for ya bro
My cup empty yo cup
If you less pour some mo
My nigga T-faris and J-dawg
And even my old school nigga Fuck
When they show us hate
We gon' show 'em back love
Now but last year would've been a different scene
But ima let you make it 
'cause I'm really tryna keep it one hundred
So stay the fuck away from me please!

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Yung Redd Verse 3)
Homie I'm different like a alien
Driven in that mothership
Its black its midnight
I'm sittin high up on that numbers list
Went from all this paper rain but now I'm never drowsy
They talk but I can't even hear the way 
They wisper 'bout me
Even if they doubt me haters I'm off limits
Blowin cake
Ohh yea I make desert for a livin
So many times I swear I spare my last one hundred
Like a grade in the class
Now that's extra credit

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

Y'all don't know a thing, about my life

Y'all don't know a thing, about my life

Y'all don't know a thing, about my life

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

[Chorus]

In my life, I went from a straw hat to a crown
I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just wanna be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggaz, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

Paul Wall,"I got the heart of a hustler
The mind of a g
I'm out here gettin' my paper
So don't fuck wit me

I wake up in the morning when the sun rise
I got my mind on paper chasing them dollar signs
It ain't no time for resting or taking naps
I got to have something so I'm counting all paper stacks
I got dreams and aspirations of ballin' big
I want a crib in the hills out there where kobe live
And I can get it if I put my grind to it
Quit making excuses up and get out there and do it
Ain't no time for games when your chasing after change
But you can face some cause that paper and close range
My mind on a range fly chains and diamonds rings
My skills are making bills with profit and high game
Ridin' the fast lane that paper in my vision
My mind on a mil ticket I'm chasing that commission
Money is my mission give me all I can get
Until they put me in a grave man I just cant quit

I got the heart of a hustler
I got the mind of a g

So don't fuck wit me

Don't fuck around man

That's right doin' and moving
White linen on my tuff tails
Not an illusion three sheets to the wind
I ain't gotta be boozen go bad on a bitch
Til I got her improvment no I'm not wit the loosing
I'm dying to win I'm goin' try it again I'm goin' cry for my sins
I live the fast life yeah and I'm not stoppin'
For shit bitch half a tank of crank and a plot to get rich
I got money out my mind likes its a price out my hat

Still smokin' even though my lung twice to collapse
I'm right back with the sack then I'm burning the shern
You know
Better learn still yernin' to earn
And really I don't listen when I talk to myself
So how the fuck you think that I'mma listen to somebody else
Its a fast life ho you know like pushin' and shit and when I run up out of gas then I'm pushin this bitch

I got heart of a hustler
I got the mind of a g
I'm out here gettin' my paper
So don't fuck wit me

I grind hard from the second I awake
When you play wit high stakes you profit at high rate
No more top roman I'm tryin' to eat steaks
So I get up off my bump and go get that cake
It ain't no time for sleep
If you snooze you loose if you broke it mean your lazy
That's the choice you choose
If you grind and you complaining and you wastin' your time
Better correct your mind suck it up and go grind
Its money to be made when my phone ring ring
I'm not to impressed wit all the bling bling
I'm much more motivated by all the ching ching
Been grindin' since kidagarden back then it was a dream
Its money over everything family first
They goin' to bury me a g and boast swangas on the hurst
I'm on the block posted making money disperse I thirst for dollar bills bein' broke is the worst

Snuck in a gallon of lemonade from chic-fil-a

I'm lookin' for a hot girl that like ta ay baybaybay
Come out and play lets see ya shake it this way

Drunkin' dueces to my partner how I see 'm big go

Leanin' like a sinkin' ship
Lit up like a christmas tree
How much throwed up can I get
Stone and lil'c

If I get pulled over DJ Jonny can pay my bond off

Beans and corn bread just bought around another damn grand
Man I'm so throwed I can't think
Who the hell been puttin' they lips on my drink
What the hell the waitress doin' wit my change
Maybe some red bull will help me sober up
Matter fact mix it wit this grey goose in my cup

Paul Wall,"[Chorus]
I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin' is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noddles bread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin' paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin' on your check from FEMA
Been evadin' the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin' a sport
""Life is Too short, wouldn't you agree?""
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin' in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin' is my quest, I grind with no rest

[Chorus]

I'm not a actor, a role model with soul or clapper
I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up
Time still movin' and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses
Girls lookin' at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her

Take time, clean my rims and go lock' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, 'cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)
This is my life, I'm only livin' it, so don't go and ruin it
Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky
Listen to Paul Wall and Chef Fly (get high)

[Chorus]

Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the Lord 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggaz scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible
The impedes is treatin' all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin' rocked like Mosley
Why niggaz on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggaz wildin' out, livin'' free, yellin' soverign
.38 revolvin', crack rock ballin
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin' on sight, fuck fightin', fuck arguin'
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin'
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'

I'm gold but you don't hear me, four to the dome if you can hear me
They say I need a pull-up when I pull up I'm the shit man
When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man
But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin' shit man
Your broad done up and broke your heart my whole squad hit man
Hold up I see dead people, its just the dead white guys on my bread people

Stacking my chips I got a bank full of Doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class
Chiefin' on that purple rain partna puff puff pass
See im higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
I'm so high

I believe I can lean spite and codeine
Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile cuz I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin' with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? dont you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

It's ""The People's Champ,"" Paul Wall, yeah that's me.
Come take a ride with a playa out the 'Lone Star State'.
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for gettin' that cake.
I came up from the bottom, now I reside at the top.
I used to run away from cops, but now it's benzes I cop.
I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint,
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde, 
And nothin' less than 24 inches of chrome on my ride.
It's just somethin' bout the way I tip 4's 
And grip grain and got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, 
My games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus]
What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before, 
But when you coming real close to me
Bringing back all of them memories
I just can't fake it, but I don't wanna go back, oh no.

They start and I finish.

Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business. 
Look, I witness, spotted like a blemish, off gimmicks.
I'm 59/50 authenic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.
Been drug tested 3 times failed it twice.

Paul Weller,"Autumn blew its leaves at me,
Threatening winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick, barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast
I have to wonder, will I last

Through the windows of the train,
I caught reflections of a paper cup,
Hanging small in a pale blue sky,
Never knowing which way's up

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around
As my anger shouts, at my own self doubt,
So a sadness creeps, into my dreams
When you're scared of living but afraid to die
I get scared of giving and I must find the faith to beat it

I must be me that's rushing by,
Time just lingers on the wind.
Bristlin' through my open fears,
I wonder what it's going to bring

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around

Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evening's tide",Above the Clouds
Paul Weller,"Unfit to live in, just about fit to burst
Like the banks of a swollen river
As bitterness does its worst
Working on your feelings, eating you all up
But you have to shake that shit to move on
An' let love carry you on up,

(it's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings off

Unfair to give in, and never changes course
If you have the choice before you
You gotta take it with a force

Or the past will take you, keep you from the truth
As bitterness rises, from the ashes of your youth

(it's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings off

Moments in time
Finding the space
To be what'cha wanna be
The things you never got
Life you never had
The dreams that you once dreamed

Finding the space, waiting your time
To be what'cha wanna be
Just be!

Or the past will take you, keep you from the truth
As bitterness rises, from the ashes of your youth

(it's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings off",Bitterness Rising
Paul Weller,"In a momentary lapse of my condition
That sent me tumbling down into a deep despair
Lost and dazed so I had no real recollection
Until the rain cleared the air
When you wake to find that everything has left you
And the clothes you wear belong to someone else
See your shadow chasing off towards the shore line
Drifting into emptiness

There are bullrushes outside my window
And their leaves whisper words in the wind
Tomorrow I'll walk to the harbour
And catch the first boat that's coming in

Like a child too small to reach the front door handle
Or maybe just too scared to know what I would find
Now I feel I'm strong enough to take the slow ride
Not knowing when I will arrive

I do believe I'm going home
'cause I don't call this place my own
I'm missing what I had
Happy times and sad
More than I ever thought could be

An open top one if it's warm
And if the flowers are in bloom

I'll be whistling down a street
You'll hear our footsteps start to meet
Then the craziness begins
An' like chalk and cheese

We'll shoot the breeze
Heading up west
In an open top deck
Trying to remember just what for

Then we'll talk for hours and hours
About nothing much at all
With your long hair falling down
In curl after curl

And I too shy to ask
What I really want to do
Racked, with my own self doubt

You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a head start for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling that I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide
(Yeah, not gonna hide, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a head start for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?

All the roads that lead to struggles
Bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
Only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
And this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock

It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.",Headstart for Happiness
Paul Weller,"I've heard them all talking I guess you have too
Adding flickers to the flame
How I've treated you

That I really didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh darling, I didn't mean to hurt you
Please believe me when I say, that I didn't mean to hurt you girl.

Whatever they tell you
There's more I could say
Lending motion to the wheel
How you built me up
When I was falling down
But who knows, you just might find
Just might find, that I'm just your kind
And I really didn't mean to hurt you.

Paul Weller,"I play out my role
Why I've even been out walking
They tell me that it helps
But I know when I'm beaten
All those lonely films
And all those lonely parties
But now the feeling is off-screen
An' the tears for real not acted, anymore

I'm all mixed up inside
I want to run but I can't hide
And however much we try
We can't escape the truth and the fact is

Don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you

And one more glance you know means goodbye
Can't you see that's why
We're dashing ourselves against the rocks of a lifetime

Here we go again

Sinkin' fast into life's surprises

Golden rain, will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve and now

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood

Only yourself that you can trust in

And I said high tide, mid afternoon, whoa
People fly by, in the traffic's boom

Golden rain will bring you riches

Paul Weller,"In a momentary lapse of my condition
That sent me tumbling down into a deep despair
Lost and dazed so i had no real recollection
Until the rain cleared the air
When you wake to find that everything has left you
And the clothes you wear belong to someone else
See your shadow chasing off towards the shore line
Drifting into emptiness

There are bullrushes outside my window
And their leaves whisper words in the wind
Tomorrow i'll walk to the harbour
And catch the first boat that's coming in

Like a child too small to reach the front door handle
Or maybe just too scared to know what i would find
Now i feel i'm strong enough to take the slow ride
Not knowing when i will arrive

I do believe i'm going home
'cause i don't call this place my own
I'm missing what i had
Happy times and sad
More than i ever thought could be

Paul Weller,"Remember how we started on a summer's night
To drunk to care abut what might
You turned my head to kiss your lips
Time stood still as my heart skipped a beat
And if I could I'd take your hand
And lead you off back to the past
I know a trail, a secret mile
An' better to cry than never smile
The moonlight shining through your flowered curtains
I think we knew it was us for certain
An' just the thing that we hoped for
Was building up into something more

Trying to find the words to say
Oh I've been searching, searching

We'll shoot the breeze heading up west in an open top deck
Oh, I'm trying to remember just what for

Then we'll talk for hours and hours
About nothing much at all
With your long hair falling down, falling down
In curl after curl

And I, too shy to ask what I really want to do
Racked with my own self doubt, oh, I stumble and fall

Try an' find myself again

Wiping all my sleep away

Uh huh oh yeah, uh huh oh yeah
Always there to confuse and fool you

And in my mind I saw the place
As each memory returned to trace
Dear Reminders of who I am

There's nothing to stop my own free fall

As all the memories merge into one
As each day becomes each day

Are just reminders of it all
The wasted days we could have lived
Now we're left with nothing left to give

This is no time for turning down
Seems like its no time for wandering

This is no time for mumbling
This is no time for forgetting your lines
This is no time for tumbling
All too much, we stumble and fall - We stumble and fall -

This is no time for dreaming
When you sleep, you wake to find
That something or someone
Has stolen your precious time

As you start to climb
This is no time to go missing
Though it is the time I'd like to most
This is no time to go fishing

Paul Weller,"High tide, mid afternoon
People fly by, in the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you are blowing
Getting to where you should be going

don't let them get you down
Making you feel quilty about
Golden rain, will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve and now

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
Now there's no justice
Only yourself that you can trust in

And I said high tide, mid afternoon
People fly by, in the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you are blowing
Getting to where you should be going

Day by day your world fades away
Waiting to feel all the dreams that say
Golden rain will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve now

And I say, climbing, foreever trying
Find you way out of the wild, wild wood
Said you are gonna find you way out of the wild, wild wood

Paul Weller,"Once I had a love, so sweet
I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
And I'd let her

And everyday was like a fairy tale
Cuts me up inside to think how I failed
I see now so well

She gave me everything she had
For the better
Gave me the key to her soul
And I let her

Once I had a love, so sweet
I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
And I let her

And every day was like a picture book
The look of love was in her eyes and how she'd looked
But me, I just took, I just took

A fellow traveler with nothing planned
Still loving me the way I am
Expecting nothing in return
And through her I got to learn

Too late for me to see
I measured out my destiny
Too late for me to know
Where I lost her, I don't know

Every day was like a picture book
The look of love was in her eyes and how she'd looked
But me, I just took, I just took

Once I had a love, so sweet
I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
And I let her

Once I had a love, so sweet
I remember
Follow me to the ends of the earth
And I let her

Yes, I let her, I let her slip away

There was a time I really loved you
But when that was I just can't say
As all the memories merge into one
As each day becomes each day

The clock hands ticking on the wall
Are just reminders of it all
The wasted days we could have lived
Now we're left with nothing left to give

We used to meet each others' eyes
And that's all we'd have to say
Now we don't talk that much at all

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet, for me wont be too soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
I wish wed move together, this time the bosses sued
But were caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children, who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through, anothers evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
I wish wed wake up one day, an everyone feel moved
But were caught up in the dailies and an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues, and masses form a line
But I know which way Id run to if the choice was mine

And the future we always leave too late

Cutting us down in size

And how I long for that sharp wind

Hair like a wheat field, I'd run through
That I'd run through 

And I miss you so I miss you so
No you're gone, I feel so alone

I'd send you a flower a sunflower bright
While you cloud my days, messing up my nights

Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning,
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol,
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard,
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays, 

That's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes,
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume,
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac,
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway

That's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight,
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude,
Getting a cab and traveling on buses,
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs

That's entertainment.",That's Entertainment
Paul Weller,"Better stop dreaming of the quiet life,
Cause it's one you'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus,
Cos their rosey days are few
And, stop apologizing for the things you've never done;
Cause time is short and life is cruel,
But it's up to us to change
This town called malice.

Rows and rows of disused milk
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk
Bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come
Fast and furious
In a town called malice.

Struggle after struggle, year after year
That atmosphere's a fine blend of ice,
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kid's new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere,
Just going round and round
Playground kids and creaking swings,
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will,
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called malice.",Town Called Malice
Paul Weller,"I took a trip down boundary lane
Try an' find myself again
At least a part I left somewhere
Buried under a hedgerow near

A lazy bridge on a hot afternoon
Water glistening while it plays a tune
Cloudburst on a rainy day
Wiping all my sleep away

Uh huh oh yeah, uh huh oh yeah
Always there to confuse and fool you

And in my mind I saw the place
As each memory returned to trace
Dear Reminders of who I am
The very roots upon which I stand

And there they were for all to see
My long, lost, used-to-be's
And all the dreams I had to dream
Were really something, not make believe

I wish now that I could tell
If all the dreams I used to dream
Are really something, not make believe",Uh-Huh Oh Yeh

Paul Weller,"The sun came out & hung above
Over our heads but far enough to see
A bomb exploding in another town
Children choking on a poison cloud
While on the streets, where lovers once walked, 
Side by side in idle talk
Bullets fall like unholy rain
People change as the panic sets in,
A frightened baby by her dead mother's side
In a brutal world where there's nowhere 
To run, hide or cry

Now nothing feels the same way,
Feels like it's changing again,
Upon a street with no name
It's hard to find it again

I ran as fast as my feet could fly
Down country lanes where I took my time-
Time like a hound snapping at my heels
I got past thinking so I could feel,
Feels like a film playing in my head
And I kept rolling down green Surrey hills,
In Spring

Now nothing feels the same way 
Feels like I'm changing again 
Upon a street with no name
It's hard to find me again,

Oh it's easy. So, so easy.

All righteousness they build thy arrow,
To shoot it straight into their lies.
Who would expect the might sparrow
Could rid the world of all their kind?

Come what may
You will be what you will
With a brush stroke of fate
You will have to think again
If you touch by it all
Lucky to be brushed by it all -
Than walk a crooked mile
In a worn out smile
That you found on the ground
Somebody else threw it down
Looks like that you're the next bessed in town

It's in a verse that you read
It's in the tune in your head
That makes all light
Turns your world
Illuminates life
And makes you see
All the love within
Is still yet to come out
Like the word - as a bang!
You may have to think again
And get touched by it all

Than walk in single file
In a worn out smile

Looks like you're the next blessed in town

Paul Weller,"Something worn, like a blanket thrown
Your tender heart, your crystal spirit
Keeps me warm and safe from harm
Wrapped around my shoulder

I love to wake and watch your face
And while you sleep, I fall for you again
Is it true, what I feel for you
Wish I could help it through
So you could feel it too

And the leaves around my door
And the sunlight in the hall
And darkness that will fall
Make me want you more

Morning breaks on the icy flakes
That collect around our window
It's cold outside brings a harsh goodbye
With clouds at our mouths as we breath a sigh

As I look like a long lending book
Page after page we are turning
But is it true what I feel for you
Wish I could help it through
So you could feel it too

And the leaves around my door
And the sunlight in the hall
And darkness that will fall
Just make me want you more
Oh, make me want you more
Want you more

Just to catch a flame

Where the world's awaiting,
I'll wait for you love,
But I close my eyes, as there's pain too in paradise,
Hey baby say, just what you're thinking,
Know I know it, yeah, feel I'm sinking,
Know I feel it, I know you feel it too,
Across the water, there's a boat that,
Will take us away.

It is shining for me
All I need to be
But I can't find the key
The one to make me believe

Late at night,
When the world is dreaming,
Way past the stars,
That ignore our fate and all twinkle too late to save us,
So we save ourselves.

Hey baby say, just what you're thinking
Know I know it, yeah, feel I'm sinking
Know I feel it, I know you feel it too,
Across the water, there's a boat that,
Will take us away,

Far from the madness, out of the sadness
Into sunlight, out of the sinking,
You know I feel it,
I know you it too,
Across the water, there's a boat that will take us away,
And there we will stay",Out of the Sinking [LP Version]
Paul Weller,"Gentle rain, here it comes again
Rattling 'round your window, threatening pain
Coming on like a friend but you know better than
Yesterday that held you by a different hand

Hail and stone and all that's gone
When everything that passes cuts to the bone
Turning like a wheel, dragging a heavy stone
A weight that ties you down that you will never own

Strange to see a paper smile on thee
When once you moved and light the room for us all to be
Now if I could be the sun I'd shine in your life
If I could be the rain I'd rain from your eyes
And I'd wash away the emptiness you feel inside

And I feel I'm floating in a time

Just what you want
Is just what you'll get
As you fall upon the real path
Or take the safer bet

Bet, you can give everything
Still none comes to you
You can hang life 'round you're neck, y'all
I may hang there too

Oh, to find myself, waiting just to fly, fly, fly

Something about the man
Is about to make a stand

With nothing but liars and thieves
Trying to purchase thee
Where are you meant to go?

His rusty armour so undervalued
Does he know that he's a reason
He's asleep now but never gone

He just waits for love
Yes, he waits for love
Yes, he waits for love

In a wind so high, it waves and glows
'Til you can't see the wood for the trees

Trying to find a way to make it fit

Let's swirl again, take us far away
To the church bell's chime in a far distant field
To a place where so lately so slow
And a time I feel like letting it go
Far away enough to catch our breath
I know where and everyone there
Looking to click, picking up sticks

Come crimson rays, paint us all the same
You know the magic is why and it's here again
Now you can't see the wood for the trees
Now like anybody on their knees

You're the one to get my heart a-jumpin'
Light of love all around your

It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill them with joy again

Each pace I take and you know why
I write for you and I to try
To take the things that lie around
And turn them into dreams so swift, so proud

It's on a time again
And it's mine again

Sweet thing, loving you is easy
Goodbye sadness when I'm around you
Giving me something I can feel
Down in my bones

Ah, sometimes, maybe just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

Fill them with love again
Sweet pea
Fill me with hope again
My sweet pea

Recollected thoughts and songs
Emblems of forgotten words
Remnants of a time so clear
Still rings fresh and true when the wind is here

It's on a time again
And it's mine again

Sweet pea, my sweet pea
Heaven knows I got a thing about ya
You're the girl to get my heart
Start jumpin' again

Ah, sometimes, baby, just sometimes
Look back on these times and smile
And have the grace to know
What you have seen

How it should be, my sweet pea?
Only God knows what I feel about ya
You're the girl to get my heart
Start pumpin' around

The future if we're lookin' at ya
It only exists because you're alive
So close your eyes and smile
Your smiles of sweet dreams

Fill them with love again

Fill them with joy again

Fill them with hope again

You don't even know me
But you hunt me the same
You don't even see me
But you seek me the same

And you cheat the scales
When you push in
The stakes are fixed
So I can never win

And if all fails you can pull on the line
It's just a whale's tale that I leave behind
You don't take no heed but you won't get my mind

Still you pay no kind keep pulling in
Chain the tide so that I can't swim
And if all else fails you can pull on the line

You don't even know me
But you own me the same
You don't even know me
But you own me the same

And when your net is empty
It's still me who you blame
When the deep blue sea grows dead and still
Take a bow, you had a hand in it

And if all fails you can pull on the line
It's a whale's tale that I leave behind
You don't take no heed but you won't get my mind
And if all else fails you can pull on the line

It's a whale's tale that I leave behind
Said you don't take no heed but you won't get my mind

Another story of a plane crash
Another story of bad news

The TV cracked up open
My baby boy came out
I was looking at my new wife
I ain't writing home about

You can call me, number 5
Please please my my
That's why I am still alive!

I boxed around a sliver ring
With blood stains on my face
I cut the dog with yellow teeth
And drove his car away

You can call me, number 5
Please please my my
Call me number 5
Call me number 5
That's why I'm still alive!",Call Me No. 5

Stay with me darling

I need you to be with me
I need you in life
I want to forever
Be yours and you'll be mine

Oh child
Cause we're going places
Never thought we could
Through all kinds of changes
But still our hearts beat closer more and more.

More than just a heart beat
From the city floor
More than just the bright lights
That lend me to your distant shore.

I'm keeping my head up
And out of the sand
Way 'cross the rooftops
I'm gonna plan our escape

Never dreamt we could

You're in my waking dreams
It's a feeling right inside of me
'til you're in my arms again

The prayer I ask, is where I'm going to
Without your undying love
I'm as worthless as a cold, cold sun
That shines for no-one, at all

How many time, must I return
From distant oceans, just to learn
That with your song
Illumination comes

And beautiful
And it has no end to write",Illumination

To be glad

We're hopelessly informed
That we're meant
We're conscious of the fact
That we're supposed
To be so sure

We're driven by the
Rain to act

We're suspect to the laws

Thing we've seen

Backed up with your talisman

'Cause for all your talk
You still got nothing to say

And half the world will give you too
Oh, caught up in your gravity issues

Ridin' to the fields we shared
Ah, takin' us closer, closer

With empty eyes and say

All the evil in our eye
When I myself, feel the high
From all that I despise
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay, in this bed I made
If I die, before I wake

Demons screaming, in my ear

Dust 2 dust

With eighty five, dumb and blind
There can be no compromise

You can kill him until he never asks you why

You can hurt her only if she cries
You can hurt her only if she cares
With all her heart with all her heart

And that could only lead to shame
Where she might end up for her children

Teach your children stories
You can fill them full of lies
You can make them all despise

I wish the day it soon would come

Of what you're saying
Or why you're saying it?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying?

Don't make promises you can't keep.
Don't make promises you can't keep.

In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
Lord, I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Seven-O-seven set to go
But I'm stuck here on the ground
Where the cold wind blows
Now the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She'll be rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar

See the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

So the airports got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Bored and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way

You're bundled up now, wait till you get older

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

Straight back for yards
When everything is everything
And everything you see
Sees us doing all the things

Still no sign from, a, those who preach
Teach me not

When all is lost and nothing claimed
Except the parts
They keep for their-selves

Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus 
'Cause those Rosey days are few
And stop apologizing for the things you've never done
'Cause time is short and life is cruel, but it's up to us to change 
This town called malice. 

Rows and rows of disused milk floats stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come fast and furious
In a town called malice. 

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice, I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice. 

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice. 

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere, just going round and round
Playground kids and creaking swings, lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will, but I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called malice.",Town Called Malice [Live]
Paul Weller,"Once upon a time
There was a time, there was
When the brightest half of the sky
Let us know we were loved
And there was a feeling old and gold
And bold
And beautiful
Something noble, something lost
Safe yet curious

When you bring back the funk y'all
Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
No place left to hide

When not only the wind in our sails
Some magic too
Sometimes we forget
Just how high the moon
It was something bright and fine
And in time
Became the world
It would shed stars and bars
All kinds of hearts
Were together again

When you bring back the funk y'all
Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
When you bring back the funk y'all
Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
No place left to hide

When you learn to speak
Whenever you want or need
When you learn to cry
When it passes you by

It is something, something to me now
It is something, something to me now
Give me something, something to me now

Once upon a dream
In the midnight hour
There was nothing like scene
And we thank the crowd
Now its a feeling tame and small
And though it all
I'll look for word
Just one more night exists
Just what if
We dreamt for all

When you bring back the funk y'all
Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
When you bring back the funk y'all
Get up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide

Or am I so jaded
I can't see or feel, like a man been tainted
Numbed by the effect, aware of the muse
Too in touch with myself, I light the fuse

I'm the changing man, built on shifting sands
I'm the changing man, waiting for the bang,
As I light a bitter fuse

Time is on loan, only ours to borrow
What I can't be today, I can be tomorrow

And the more I see, the more I know
The more I know, the less I understand.

It's a bigger part,
When our instincts act
A shot in the dark,
A movement in black

And the more I see, the more I know
The more I know, the less I understand.

Paul Weller,"The sunny sand we ran along
Everyday began upon
The summer's kiss of love and adventure

And every dune that we fell into
Left a mark upon us too
Etched forever as a moment we'd remember
And we'd remember

The empty woods where we played
Every hour of every day
The holidays went on forever

And in the woods was a soldier's tomb
The ghost of which looked over you
And God was there amongst the trees
We felt his whisper in the summer's breeze
And every night and every day
I learnt to love it in a special way
As I remember, what it's like to walk amongst butterflies",Amongst Betterflies [*]
Paul Weller,"When I'm in the crowd, I don't see anything
My mind goes a blank, in the humid sunshine
When I'm in the crowd I don't see anything
I fall into a trance, at the supermarket
The noise flows me along, as I catch falling cans
Of baked beans on toast, technology is the most

And everyone seems just like me,
They struggle hard to set themselves free
And their waiting for the change

When I'm in the crowd, I can't remember my name
And my only link is a pint of walls ice cream
When I'm in the crowd - I don't see anything

Sometimes I think that its a plot
An equilibrium melting pot
The government sponsors underhand
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

And everyone seems that they're acting a dream
Cause they're just not thinking about each other
And they're taking orders, which are media spawned
And they should know better, now you have been warned

And don't forget you saw it here first
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

And life just simply moves along
In simple houses, simple jobs
And no ones wanting for the change
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

Paul Weller,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)

And as the rain came down, I dropped to my knees and prayed
I said oh heavenly thing, please cleanse my soul,
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all.

I was halfway home, I was half insane,
And every shop window I looked in just looked the same
I said send me a sign to save my life
Cause at this moment in time there is nothing certain in
These days of mine

Yes its a frightening thing when it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked (I might as well stay)
And promise myself each and every day, that,

And when you're down on the bottom there's nothing else
But to shout to the top, shout!",Shout to the Top

Warm air blows, down upon her soft bed
She licks my face and the feeling spreads

She's anything that you can call free
She's everything that she wants to be
She has everything that you could want to see

I'm up in Suzes' room, where life goes so soon
Soon, against the moon

I looked across this world, there was no one to be seen
This empty feeling turned and quietly walked away
I saw no warmth in life, no love was in my eyes
I stared a century thinking this will never change
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell, too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!

I lost some hours thinking of it
I need the strength to go and get what I want
I lost a lifetime thinking of it
An' I lost an era daydreaming like I do

I stared a century thinking this will never change
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell, too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!
In echoed steps you walk across an empty dream
But look around this world, there's millions to be seen
Come see the tyrants panic, see their crumbling empires fall
Then tell 'em we don't fight for fools 'cause love is in our hearts!

You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the onlooking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows, yeah

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate

Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken-down, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill

Paul Weller,"Where the streets are paved with blood
With cataclysmic overtones
Fear and hate linger in the air
A strictly no-go deadly zone
And I don't know what I'm doing here
'Cause it's not my scene at all
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to

I'm stranded on the vortex floor
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour
Through the haze, I can see my girl
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor

'A' bomb off in Wardour Street
It's blown up the West End, now it's spreading through the City

'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the City
Now it's spreading through the country

Law and order takes a turn for the worst
In the shape of a size-ten boot
Rape and murder throughout the land
And they tell you that you're still a free man
If this is freedom I don't understand
'Cause it seems like madness to me
'A' bomb in Wardour Street
Hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb

Paul Weller,"The distant echo
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""
I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife
'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

Paul Weller,"I sat alone with the dreams of children
Weeping willows and tall dark building, and
I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children
But woke up sweating to this modern nightmare, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children
I got a feeling of optimism
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture
The streets below left me feeling dirty, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

Books will burn, people laugh and cry in their turmoil
(Turmoil turns rejoiceful)
Shed your fears and lose your guilt
Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home
And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led pissing themselves laughing
(And the flames grew)
Their mad eyes bulged, their flushed faces said
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger

We feast on flesh and drink on blood
Live by fear and despise love in a crises
(What with today's high prices)
Bring some paper and bring some wood
Bring what's left of all your love for the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher!
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home
And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led pissing themselves laughing

Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said

We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home

We'll watch the flames grow higher

Freedoms never cheap
But all the things she needed in life, she had no need to keep.
Of all the things she asked of me
None were ever fun
And I'm no good at acting while, the cameras on the run.

Don't you know, she threw it all away
I wonder how she feels today.
She threw it all away
I wonder if she's there to stay.

I tried, a bit, to change into, something that I'm not
But trying to mold with dynamite is like giving lions spots.

Guess you knew, she threw it all away
Don't shed a tear there's no need to cry.
She threw it all away
I played both parts in the fool and I.

Yes, I know your hurting inside
But I can't stop those tears in your eyes, falling from your face
Every time you fall apart
I knew at the start, when it happened again
It was the start of the end for us.

Paul Weller,"I remember all the early days
Trying to think of the right things to say
I didn't want you to think I was like the rest
Who think they own you just because you've laid with them
It didn't matter, really didn't matter
It didn't matter now we are together

There are crystal hearts just waiting to be smashed
And out to break them are the ones who never last
To soon today and gone tomorrow
And taking with them just another little piece of you

There are those who think its smart
Thinking that they've stole your love and broke your heart
Too much too soon and gone tomorrow
Well my love doesn't need to lend or steal or borrow",It Didn't Matter [Single Edit]
Paul Weller,"
It's no good praying to the powers that be
'Cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with Holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think ""get rich quick; take all I can""
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the Empire corners,
""Civilization"" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spinless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like I say, make me wonderful

Their morals are clean and their clear
They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap; blood on your hands
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
Come spend a penny, go out with a pound
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

(On the money-go-round, you wanna get on but it won't slow down)

The need your votes and you know where to send 'em
Be we don't get the choice of a public referendum
On all the real issues that affect our lives
Like the USA base to which we play midwife
Take a cruise and forget this scene
Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Born of woman, killed by man
Watch the money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they pray, make it wonderful

The good and righteous sing their hymns
The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I don't think he was an astronaut
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I must insist - he was a Socialist!

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

They tell us what they want, they don't give an inch

The truth is in what you see, not what you read
Little men tapping things out, points of view
Remember their views are not the gospel truth

Is that I need it so I can't help myself
Like a hungry child, I just help myself
And when I'm all full up, I go out to play

Lonely as the moors on a winter's morning
Quiet as the sea on a good calm night
In your tranquil shadow, I try and follow

I hear your distant shoe clicks, to the midnight beat
I feel trapped in sorrow, in this imagery
But that's how I am and why I need you so

But I don't mean to bleed you dry
Or take you over for the rest of your life
It's just that I need something solid in mine

Believe me baby, your precious love, that means so much
Will it ever stop or will I just lose touch?

I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs

They say don't know, don't care and I've got to go, mate

They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs

You've got to move in a straight line
You've got to walk and talk in four-four time
You can't be weird in a strange town
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners

You've got to wear the right clothes
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose
You can't be nice in a strange town
'Cause we don't know, don't care and we got to go, man

Rush my money to the record shops
I stop off in a back street buy myself a snort
We got our own manifesto, be kind to queers
And I'm so glad the revolution's here
It's nice and warm now!

I've finished with clubs where the music's loud
'Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd
There's no one there
I look in the mirror, but I can't be seen
Just a thin, clean layer of mister sheen looking back at me

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you

Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

On this fine and lovely night tonight
We'll walk past the luscious houses
Through rolling lawns and lovely flowers

Our nice new town where the curtains are drawn
Where hope is started and dreams can be borne

Let us share our insanity
Go mad together in Community
Boys on the corner looking for their supper
Boys 'round the green looking for some slaughter

We used to chase dreams, now we chase the dragon
Mine is the semi with the Union Jack on

In our paradise lost we'll be finding our sanity
In this paradise found we'll be losing our way
For a brave new day

May I slash my wrists tonight?

I was looking for a job so I came to town
I easily adopt when the chips are down

I liked the idea but now I'm not so Keyne

My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder
And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder!
It seems a constant struggle just to exist
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -

From this window I've seen the whole world pass
From dawn to dusk I've heard the last laugh laughed
I've seen enough tears to wash away this street
I've heard wedding bells chime and a funeral march

Do it today!""

I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style
For I realize your love means more than anything
(the song you make me sing, yeah",You're the Best Thing
Paul Weller,"The distant echo,
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts

Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen

Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""

And I said, ""I've a little money and a take away curry,
I'm on my way home to my wife.
She'll be lining up the cutlery,
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday, a cheap holiday,
Do it today!""

I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
'cause they took the keys and she'll think its me
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
Don't want to go down in a tube station at midnight",Down in the Tube Station at Midnight

Waiting for that girl to come
Oh, she's the one

Got my hands deep in my pockets
Trying to keep out all the rain
She caused me such pain

But she's got me so
Lord, that girl drive me insane

In that far off distance
I can see the lights of town
It sure bring me down

No I miss them so
Lord, I can't stay here no more

Waiting for the dice to roll
Where I'm heading I don't know
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Paul Weller,"I had 22 dreams last night
And you were in 21
The last one I saved for myself
Just to save my soul

I got this scene by a fireplace
I lose control and I'm in that place
I had 22 dreams last night

I had 45 films to watch
But only one I could take
The mysteries of a secret smile
It was so dull a place

Pull me over with a loving kiss
I remember all the things I missed
You mean so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun
I had 22 dreams last night

You pick me up with a loving kiss
I remembered all the things I missed
You mean so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun

I had 22 dreams last night
And you were in 21
That's enough for a lifetime of dreams
That's enough for anyone

Still battling on when all your enemies are gone

What would it matter to you
If the pleasure always planned
Was right there in your hand
But no one there to see that

The taste of fear and fortune,
The smell of toil and sweat,
But if the crowd ain't there to see it
It's just another memory

And God said look at you, don't look at me
You only call on me when you need me
And when you don't, you hardly think of me at all

I don't enter your head for weeks at a time
And the times I do are in your despair that you created and not I
And still you look up at me in such pleading terms
That's how I kinda come to know you

But don't look at me look at you
Don't look at me look at you

And every night I pray to God
Please save the lives of those I love and take me instead
If you really need someone to keep you company
On that golden chair in the glare

Bring your guns to the table and recite your prayer
Lose all your hatred if you are to pray in there
The temple you're seeking is in front of your nose
Because the message you're giving is doing nothing for those

Seek and you shall find

Pass through doors and windows

I thought every hair on my body was alive
And so it was

Now you can't even see the granted time

I just feel the color drain from me

And the surf and the sea

I will still call him son

Hanging small in a pale blue sky

I have to wonder, will I be around

So a sadness creeps into my dreams

I get scared of giving and I must find the faith to beat it

Never know how much I care
'Cause when you put your arms around me
I get a fever I can hardly bear
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever through the daytime
I get a fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you kiss me
And I know you're gonna treat me right
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever through the daytime
I get a fever all through the night

Bless my soul I love you
Take me so far away
Take these arms I'll never use
Just believe what my words have to say

Paul Weller,"Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child,
The things you're saying like ""I'm so free and so wild""
And I believe it when you look in my eyes,
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true,
But at least there's no lecture

I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like ""I'm so free and so wild""
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how

Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

I really like it when you speak like a child

The way you hate the homely rank and the file
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild

Paul Weller,"A hazy mist hung down the street
The length of it's mile as far as my eye could see
The sky so wide, the houses tall
Or so they seemed to be so they seemed to me so small

And it gleamed in the distance
And it shone like the sun
Like silver and gold

It went on and on it went on and on

Summer nights that seemed so long
Always call me back to return as I rewrite this song
The ghosts of night, the dreams of day
Make me swirl and fall and hold me in this way

And it's still in the distance
And it shines like the sun
Like silver and gold

It goes on and on, it goes on and on
It goes on and on, it goes on and on

Rolling stock rocked me to sleep
Amber lights flashing 'cross the street
And on the corner a dream to meet

Paul Weller,"Bring you a tale from the pastel fields
Where we ran when we were young
This is a tale from the water meadows
Trying to spread some hope into your heart 
It's mixed with happiness, it's mixed with tears
Both life a death are carried in this stream
That open space you could run for miles
Now you don't get so many to the pound

True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to
That I'll always run to
Won't you join me by the riverbank

Paradise found down by the still waters
Joined in the race to the rainbow's end
No fears no worries just a golden country
Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset

Now life is so critical, life is too cynical
We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul

True it's a dream mixed with nostalgia
But it's a dream that I'll always hang on to
That I'll always run to

Try an' find myself again

As each memory returned to trace
Dear reminders of who I am
The very roots upon which I stand 

And there they were for all to see
My long, lost, used to be's
And all the dreams I had to dream
Were really something, not make believe

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Come On/Lets Go
Paul Weller,"Do you still feel the same way about it
Like you always said you would
Or has time re-written everything
Like you never dreamt it could
Remember when we wanted to fly forever
On a magic carpet ride
Well forever seems a long time
Cutting us down in size
No matter how hard we try 
And I could see all I had done
Just chasing dreams across the fields
In the shadow of the sun
I plan to have it all while I'm still young
And chase the fields across my dreams
In the shadow of the sun
In the shadow of the sun
Once upon a time I might have told you
But now nothing seems that plain
However much we're changing
There are some things the same
And those same things still say
And I could see all I had done

To show my long strong legs so fine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So fine

Was a time, I was a mother
Darling children would come for me
I loved them and I'd feed them
And in their eyes such love I'd see
They'd call my name in times of need

And I'd be there
(And they loved me)
And they loved me
(And we loved you)

And I loved them
(And they loved me)
And they loved me
(And we loved you)

Once I was a man
My cock as hard as wood
I stood as strong as any tree
Look back, the winds are catching me

So, my woman, love me
And you know I am strong
I was raised and nude as trees
I stood

Trees Lyrics
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)
My baby loves me
(My baby loves me)

I was back to this time itself
Deep and sharp within my empty cell
A comedy of errors I've become
And all my devils, I forgot
And on my name or where I've come

Someone take me back to the fields
Where I need to be
So once again I can stand tall and feel
Once more, a tree",Trees
Paul Weller,"Two fat ladies at my door'
Over the hills and far much more
Seeking the teats of mother and child
Some marked bitter, others mild
Two fat ladies click, click, cock
I've gone too far and far too quick

Yester, yesterday is gone
Very nice then but now all worn
Dry that, dry that tear away
Come back when the world has changed

On and on and on we go
Courage and brave for all on show
On and on, on and on we go
Two fat ladies, 88

Chatting and waiting on a garden gate
Two young fellows not too late
What's the time andWhat's our fate?
Sugar, sugar - ain't it sweet
Loves your mind but rots your teeth
Looking for sugar for my bowl

Up the apples
And down the road Been all over
This town today
But can't find my feet
Or stand up straight

Silver veils that dance and hide
Golden tales lay on their side
Raise my glass, I'm in the pink

I'm sitting here
Waitinq for the sun to sink
On and on and on we go",Two Fat Ladies

The dust that dances

Your lips are like milk, honey
I'll grow through your cracks
And you'll see
I'll make it right, I'll make it right",Up the Dosage

Away across the sea
Setting up his easel
A new scene to see
Says that he's had enough
Of standing in the rain

And what is shown?
Meeting all these pretty girls
Singing golden hair
He's in touch with the painter's mind
And Syd's unflinching stare
Drinking wine in the Moulin Rouge
Sipping kaffee in Berlin
Might take in the colored lights
In the city they call sin

He could see
The writing on the wall
Ten feet tall
But oh there are times
He wished the world
Would fade just into sight
And oh, the feelings that changed
Were thicker than the brush
Strokes of fame
Now he rides the dirt roads
Of old southern Spain
And when senoritas sing
He can hear them say

My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
Paul West,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Paul West,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Paul West,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me
Paul West,"Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (the cotton was growin' fine)
But that was another place and another time",Willie and Laura Mae Jones

You`re my first glimmer of light
You were my. You was my first

I guess they tore that bridge out
Where we used to meet
And no one can see there

Turning calendars forgotten

Paul Westerberg,"Father left
You were crushed
Like the petals of a flower
Between the pages of a novel

A long forgotten bookmark
The end of a sad chapter

To dress in black plastic
Or sing with your eyes only
As though you were autistic

Whisper diamonds and insolence
Enter misadventure
Neither tawdry or resplendent
In clothes that hide your figure

He was a dirty picture window
Mister Inappropriate
Who washes his hands after

He things someone is watching
Too restless for education
Craves only entertainment

I'm the one who can attempt to be your friend

If you need someone
To tell everything you've done
Then lie to me
I'm the one who can still pretend

Call me when your eyes are empty
And open all night

You lied enough
Open wide enough
To drive a truck straight like a knife
Only lie worth telling

Is I'm in love with you
I'm the only lie worth telling
I'm in love with you
Only lie worth telling 
I'm the only lie worth telling",Only Lie Worth Telling
Paul Westerberg,"Your delicate condition
As any fool can tell
The camera wouldn't tell a fib
You're making love to no one else

You're fragile and you're difficult
An artist in every sense
It's the dialogue I can live without
Hurry up, my place or his

You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty little trap shut
You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty trap shut

Everybody sees you coming
You're as subtle as a battering ram
The foreign press is watching you undress
Just like a paid program

You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty little trap shut
You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty little trap shut

You're power drunk with passion
A fact I can't ignore
We don't dare ask for your photograph
You couldn't bear lying in some drawer

You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty little trap shut
You ought to be a silent film star
Keep that pretty little trap shut",Silent Film Star
Paul Westerberg,"I'm a dirty diesel
Pumping down the line
Hear my whistle blowing
Hear my engine whine

Hear me from your pillow
Hear me on the call
See my smoke, it billows
Up around your heart.

Grandpa was all covered
In locomotive grease
Grandma was loaded
Drunk on anti-freeze

Well, you may not know it
By looking at your only dead man

That's right

A dirty, black diesel
Pumpin down the line
Used to be a bad boy
Hear my engine whine
Hear my engine whine

Creeping through the junction
Pulling out at night
I won't be back soon
Gotta schedule to keep right

You say that you love me
On your pillow
Smoke, it starts to billow
My engine starts to whine

Engine is whining",Dirty Diesel
Paul Westerberg,"Well, I'm drinkin' once again
Just to make the pills kick in
I'm drinkin', once again there ain't no doubt
You better look out, drinkin' once again
I want to scream and shout
Want to let the bad guys win, let 'em out

I used to be as sober as a hangin' judge
Now the law has went and left me flat
You better go around, baby, now I won't budge
Thinkin' I'm back, knockin' 'em back
Knock knockin' 'em back

I'm drinkin', once again
Just to make them pills kick in
And just to see the bad guys win

I used to be as sober as a hangin' judge
Now the law has went and left me flat
Better go around, baby, now I won't budge
I'm back, knock knockin' 'em back
Knock knockin' 'em back

Here's a dollar, gotta get more money
Here's a bottle, now I'm funny

Drinkin' again
Just to make the pills kick in
Oh, you ain't gettin' used to me at your university
Just want to let the bad guys out

I used to be as sober as a hangin' judge
Now I see the law has left me flat
Out of my way, go around, baby, I won't budge
Knockin' 'em back
Knock knockin' 'em back
Knock knockin' 'em back

Well, I know it's almost over and that ain't no lie
Spirits that I'm drinkin' once again
Last night I got up and I got dressed to cry

Drinkin' again, drink drinkin' again
Drink drinkin' again
Drink drinkin' again, drink drinkin' again
Drink drinkin' again
This here to you, baby

Paul Westerberg,"Meet me down the alley
Tonight

I wanna breathe
Some new life
Into me
And you and yours and mine

When we were young
We never played
Out in the street
We'd only run
Where we felt safe

Come on and meet me down the alley
We ain't too young to die
Meet me down the alley
Tonight

I wanna be
Some new place
I wanna see
Something I'll never see again

We ain't too young to die
Meet me down the alley
Tonight

Where I live now there's no sidewalk
Only small talk
Where I live now I feel safe

Meet me one last time

Never felt like this before

My heart is breaking all that's left
Since I met you

Never felt like this before
I never will again, I'm sure",Never Felt Like This Before
Paul Westerberg,"Well, I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days, these days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do for you
And all the times I had the chance to

Well, I had a lover
It's so hard to risk another these days
These days, now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
Well, it's just that I've been losing for so long

Well I'll keep on moving, moving on
Things are bound to be improving
These days, one of these days
These days I'll sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend

Don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them

",These Days
