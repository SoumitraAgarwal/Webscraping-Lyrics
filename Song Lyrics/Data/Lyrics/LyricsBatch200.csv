Job for a Cowboy,"I sleep on a cross for my madness
I exist within a foundation of stone
Encircled and smothered within bars of rust

It all helps me rest within a confine of serenity
Sealed windows and doorways feel
Like decrepit paintings on the walls

Pieces of immovable art
Grow an everlasting flavour of neglect and dust
An existence within a casket to bear the living

My humble and delusional confine
My humble and delusional confine

Pieces of immovable art
Grow an everlasting flavour of neglect and dust
An existence within a casket to bear the living

I sleep on a cross for my madness
I exist within a foundation of stone

It all helps me rest within a confine of serenity
Sealed windows and doorways feel
Like decrepit paintings on the walls

Pieces of immovable art
Grow an everlasting flavour of neglect and dust

I sleep on a cross for my madness
I exist within a foundation of stone
Encircled and smothered within bars of rust",The Stone Cross
Job for a Cowboy,"Sun of Nihility, I shamefully disturb you
My relentless knocking is constantly ignored
I can narrowly overhear your serene breathing anymore
Have you grown weary of spinning measureless circles across the sky?

Are you drained of feeding and decalcifying my awakening third eye
A resting place to connect with the Earth's depths
I lay designating my dreams as masters under composed breath
Enraptured by the sphere of damnation",Sun of Nihility
Job for a Cowboy,"Finding comfort in knowledge of an enthralling higher power
My transformation catalyzed from our continual encounters
As I draw breath from clouds littering a synthetic sea
I overlook how trustful we are. So simple, so damned naive
I beg for one's own remission, simultaneously teething the flesh that breeds religion
Transmitted whispers crawl into each of us and birth dictating monsters
All creations encircling me are charades and impostors
So trustful we are. So simple, so damned naive
All comprehension I've discovered was all concocted to deceive",The Synthetic Sea
Job for a Cowboy,"A landscape of mountains and filth floods my perspective
Nightfall worms its way, mutating the air into a black mass of secrets
It's alluring as I stand on the summit of self-destruction in all of its brilliance
I have a panoramic view of my prodigal fate with a nose dive out of existence
My untouched eyelids unlock in a pineal gland trance of blasphemy
My cerebral matter synthesizes a sharpened warmth forming a kaleidoscopic ecstasy
A fond farewell decent morphs to a stairwell of a hallucinogenic world
Lost in a sea of illusions and alternate reality",Worming Nightfall
Jobim-Morelenbaum,"Ela é carioca, ela é carioca
Basta o jeitinho dela andar
Nem ninguém tem carinho assim para dar

Eu vejo na cor dos seus olhos
As noites do Rio ao luar
Vejo a mesma luz, vejo o mesmo céu
Vejo o mesmo mar

Ela é meu amor, só me vê a mim
A mim que vivi para encontrar
Na luz do seu olhar
A paz que sonhei

Só sei que sou louco por ela
E pra mim ela é linda demais
E além do mais
Ela é carioca, ela é carioca

Só sei que sou louco por ela
E pra mim ela é linda demais
E além do mais
Ela é carioca, ela é carioca",Ela ĂŠ Carioca
JoBoxers,"You're the thing that makes me weak
My heart knows of the beat I seek
And I found it (just got lucky)
Oh yes I found it (just got lucky)

I never worry that your love is fake
I'm feeling easy and I'm feeling ???
Cause I found it (just got lucky)
Before I found it (just got lucky)

And I never felt this way before
Like a dog always begging for more

I've been fooled by love so many times
I gave up on love and silly rhymes
Got my feelings always on my heart
Locked doors, the key was cut, it was a fake
Now I'm such a very lucky girl
Gang way, ???? 

(gotta hear me say) Got the answer and it's plain to see
(gotta hear me say) I'm for you and you're for me

I feel a quiver that I never miss
The sky's the limit with a friend like this
And I found it (just got lucky)
Together we found it (just got lucky)

And I never felt this way before
Like a dog always begging for more

I've been fooled by love so many times
I gave up on love and silly rhymes
Got my feelings always on my heart
Locked doors, the key was cut, it was a fake
Now I'm such a very lucky girl

Jobriath,"Do you have to show up on every corner
Won't the dancin' begin without you
Do you have to put on your eyes for me
Be still I love you
Now be still

But did you really see the starset
In your restless eyes I found the city lights
Be still I love you
Now be still

Be still I love you
Be still I love you

Jobriath,"Outside of my window
The rain's fallin' down
It's fallin' so close its chill is near yet far
Away

And the splash of the busy wheels
The thunder of the mourning
Fade to silence in a distant dream that carried me
Away

Outside
The little yellow raincoats running in the rain
Beckon, how they beckon with their sweet refrain
Their gentle laughter

Outside
Those fools that don't know 'nough to come in out of the rain
Would you know they would if they could just remain
Inside
Inside with someone like you

Poor fools that don't know 'nough to come in out of the rain
Would they know they would if they could just remain

Jobriath,"So what if a-wop-bop-a loo-bam boom didn't rhyme
Billy Haley and the Comets drove me to the prom in time
A Little Richard goes a long long way
More than twenty long years to this day
Rock of ages roll away, rock away, roll away

We were dancin' in the streets and shapin' our lives in school
When we were simply thirteen, God saved the Queen in Liverpool
A mop top Mersey goes a long, long way
More than ten long years to this day
Rock of ages roll away, rock away, roll away

Three plays for a quarter is ancient history now
But the Stones roll away and rock that jukebox till
Satisfaction goes a long, long way
Much more than five long years to this day
Rock of ages roll away, rock away, roll away
A Little Richard goes a long, long way
More than twenty long years to this day

Jocelyn Brown,"I can't get off my high horse and I can't let you go
You are the one who
You are the one who makes me feel so real, yeah

Oh, what am I supposed to do
Oh, what am I supposed to do, baby

When I'm so hooked up on you
Then I realized, oh, I realized

Can you remember the times we've spent together
Sharin' the days in the sun

You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I'm so hooked on you
And then I realized that you're somebody else's guy

That day in September, I'm sure you can remember
That's when all the stuff hit you fast
You told me a lie and you didn't have an alibi
But baby, yet I still cared

You know, I loved you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no, no

Jocelyn Brown,"I'm caught up in a one night love affair
  Hoping true love will find me there
  Caught up in a one night love affair
  In need of love again, that's just the way I am

Before I let you in
There's just one thing I wanna say
There's no need to pretend
That this will end another way
Tomorrow you'll wake up and be on your way
Forget all the things you say tonight
That's why...

* Repeat

So make yourself at home
I want you only for a while
I haven't got much time
To find the man behind the smile
I'm a fairy-tale princess in search of a knight
And I never believe dreams come true
I'm just like you
You see...

* Repeat (x4)

Stay for a while, baby
Got to hold you for a while
Lay with you in style
Close the door and I'm next to you

watch what I'm gonna do

Jocelyn Brown,"You got me down
Running all around this town
'Cause you think you're ahead of the game

But I'll let you know
Baby you don't run the show
When it comes to my happiness or pain
Of course it's true
There's all I can do
Just to keep up with all your crazy tricks
At my expense you build up your confidence
But baby you just don't know when you're late

'Cause
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
Love's gonna get you baby
Oh oh ooh yeah
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes indeed
Love's gonna get you baby
So don't you try to run from me
No, no

You must admit that it doesn't quite fit
The way you keep me runnin' so hard
If you don't care
Then why act so scared?
When I send to you my calling card
You should be flattered
To me it really matters
In this chase whether I lose or I win
You ain't fast enough to keep me from catching up
So why don't you just turn yourself in?

'Cause
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
Love's gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna make you my man
Love's gonna get you baby
Don't you try to run from me

Your lead can dance
'Cause you know I'm way too fast
And 'cause this is only a test
I've got the power to chase you back the hour
So I'm taking your heart under arrest
I'm a deputy of love
And if you are thinking of
When it comes to committing a crime
Baby you have seen
It's just grand larceny
When I feel your love and make it mine

Why waste your time?
You know you gonna be mine
There is no escape from my master plan
Soon you will be
Locked up in my heart's custody
Then you wonder why you ever ran

Don't you know that love's gonna get you
Don't you know that love's gonna get you baby
You know that
You know that love's gonna get you
It's gonna get you
Love's gonna get you baby
It's waiting out there for you
Love's gonna get you
One day boy
Don't you know that?
Love's gonna get you baby
Gonna turn around and stand
You know
Love's gonna get you
Love love love love
Love's gonna get you baby

Do you know that baby
Love's gonna get you
It's looking over you
Love's gonna get you baby
Locked up in my heart's custody
Love's gonna get you
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Love's gonna get you baby
One day you'll see that
Love's gonna get you
Reach out your arms and grab you, boy
Love's gonna get you baby
 
Love's gonna get you

 It's like a story of love 
 Can you hear me 
 Came back only yesterday 
 I'm moving further away

Jocelyn Enriquez,"To live in a house not a home
I've counted my tears falling down each night for all these years
I can't believe it ends like this
We've gone on our own separate ways to find ourselves again
Where should I go from here can I live here without your love
Somehow someday I'll make it through
Please help me ease the pain
I'm lost I can't find my way
Hope and pray it will end in time the pain inside
Can somebody hear I'm crying for shelter
Please help me see this through
A world that can no longer feel
Seems that they have abandoned me forgotten me
Do I blame myself
Save me from being alone
How can you mend a lonely soul
Trying to leave the past the sorrow and the lies
How can I forgive someone who just doesn't understand
That true love is gone away
Maybe it's for the best to live these lives on our own
To say goodbye still I wonder why
Please help me ease the pain
I'm lost I can't find my way
Hope and pray it will end in time the pain inside
Can somebody hear I'm crying for shelter
Please help me see this through
A world that can no longer feel
Seems that they have abandoned me forgotten me
Do I blame myself

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day

Jocelyne Jocya,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

You came along to claim it.

Till your kiss helped me name it.
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for,
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more.

Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Roll about eight deep now what's my next move
Waitin' to nightfall so I can enjoy
System pumped by four Jeeps, runnin' like a convoy

And me, I'm just layin' on the prowl
Got say what's up as the girls cry out
She grabbed her man, I think she tried to play him
My only thought, was to step to the A-M
Cause I came to have a good time
And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine
Cause I don't have to raise my voice to be seen
I maintain, if you know what I mean
Understand I'm not conceded, Father's just mellow
I'm a smooth, dark Romeo, freak kinda fellow

Puffin Sweet, gettin' ripped, what the hell
I see Mr. Uptown, it's Andre Farwell
Conversatin' with his boys
I say stop and barge straight through the crowd,
It's time to get charged
It's kinda mellow so I leap,
To the center where the soul's rollin' five deep
Mark Currey, a ??, kin and nephew
Doin' the wild thing 'cause the soul is true
And every time I see bodies gettin' biz'
Girls are gettin' wild 'cause Father's known for his
And every time ya hear the music thumpity-thump
And all the girls gettin' bumped right in ya rump
So everybody who feel the mood is right
Get on the dance floor tonight

Why is it this way

Could we both just stop

I know you feel the same girlfriend

Who was that guy I caught you walking with
In your smile I knew you wasn't with it
Let's stop awhile
And start our love again
It won't take no time
For our hearts to mend

All alone I sit at home baby

The time is so right

Go through the storms
And look back on

The times we shared together
Make it last forever
The times we shared together
Make it last forever

Can't forget the night
We watched for the sun
We laughed and played
Then morning comes
Just like the day we started our heart
It was sunrise when we made our first love
The times

The times we shared together
Make it last forever
The times we shared together
Make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

We laughed and played now til morning come

I like the way you kiss me
Holding me girl when we do this
It keeps me rising high

Say nothing not a thing girl
Could compare to the love we share together

For the wrong i've done 
And let's try again 
To make it last so long

Listen baby 
I can't wait 
To feel your love again 
Cause you can stop this pain

So let's start all over 
And put the past behind 
And make a love to stand 
To the test of time
