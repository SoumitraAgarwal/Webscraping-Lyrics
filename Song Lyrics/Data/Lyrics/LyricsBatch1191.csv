Sugababes,"Love comes and love goes
And who knows what life holds
Love is as love does
So don't ask for too much
Don't sit back and let your heart just break
Cause what you give is what you take
Love is as love was before
So you ought to know

All the universe is looking to fall in love
But you gotta first find yourself
To love someone else

[Chorus]
Supernatural
International
Unstoppable
That's just how it goes
It's practical
It's actual
It's a fact
That everybody wanna be loved
Supernatural

Unstoppable
That's just how it goes
It's practical

It's a fact
That everybody wanna be loved
Everybody, everybody wanna be loved

Love stays and love leaves
Love can get ugly
I trust you, you trust me
Love can be trust free
Don't sit back and let it pass you by
Cause you don't miss the water till the well is dry
So love me, I'll love you
Before we do, you ought to know

All the universe is looking to fall in love
But you gotta first find yourself
To love someone else

[Chorus: x2]

Hurts so good
It hurts so bad
Love is better when you feel passionate
Taste so good
Just how it should be
Love is better when its bittersweet
Do you think that you control
How love should go. NO

[Chorus: x2]

It's a fact that everybody wanna be loved, yeah",Supernatural
Sugababes,"He's nothing special
Don't need his dough
Settling down what is that a joke
You're feeling his best friend 
Your ex bores you
''cause he started to ignore you

He starts his speech
Tell him not to preach
Always talking out of his ass
What's the point of that
He's not on your level
Like the new man
The fly man
The man who really understands

Remember a good way
To get out of an old thing
Is to jump into a new thing and

Switch
If you don't deliver
You just ditch
Grab another lover
Scratch your itch
From dusk 'til dawning
Until that new guy has you yawning
Switch
If he don't please you
You just ditch
Find someone to tease you
Makes you itch
Freaks you 'til the morning
Until this new guy has you yawning

Same old thing the TV
The video, he's got to know
Conversations growing old
You've heard those jokes
They're cold
Could he think that the kiss on the text
Means a pizza
Then action attraction
He's got it all wrong

Remember a good way
To get out of an old thing
Is to jump into a new thing and

Find someone to tease you
Makes you itch
Freaks you 'til the morning
Until this new guy has you yawning

Hanging around on borrowed time
One strike out
You ain't mine
So just get your style in check
I move one ex to the next
Everything he does beats you
So I'm jumping another queue
Please just get your style in check
I move one ex to the next

Sugababes,"She wants to be beautiful
Feeling kinda sexual
Getting it on
Hips moving walking down the street
Lips talkin' sayin' something sweet
But she doesn't know

Strobe lights
I'm lookin' tight
In my snake skin boots
Feelin' lucky tonight
C'mon hormones raging
I want to feel the pageing 
Take a look inside
It's amazin'

How do I know if I'm ready to take it there
Just think' about it really scares me like Freddy
'Cause I'm virgin virgin sexy
If you want me jus text me
'Cause I'm having a chemical reaction
C'mon baby

Or she see is lust in his eyes
Like he wants to be the first 
She ain't ready for the surprise
He just wants to get the job done
Heading straight for the dangerzone
Daddy wants to keep her ass home
Want's to explore the unknown
Roaming like a little cell phone

Sugababes,"Every minute passes by
You're always talking
Makes me cry
Finding out the reasons why
I'm needing space get out my ride
Talking about what I do, where I go, who I'm with and why I don't bring you
Think about the times you pushed me
Saying ""baby please don't go""
You make me sick
Yeah, yeah

I'll make you lost in
Times before you break my small
You claim you love me, tease me, leave me, hold me, please me
Get off I'm movin' on
Cause I'm tryin' to take control

[Chorus]
But it's you talking dirty
When I'm trying to sleep
And it's you, said you love me
After just one week
Tell me who's always calling on my telephone
Now it's you tryin' to tell me
We should take things slow

And you said, ""don't go, don't go, please don't go
Please don't leave me, on my own
Don't go, don't go, please don't go
Please don't leave me, on my own""

You're creepin', sneaking, cheating, on me
Leavin', this round,
Gotta end the strike cos it ain't going down
Now you wanna come back, claim you give me a track
I forgive what you do then you want it back
I'm sick of playing this game
I ain't sticking with a claim fame
Stop this, right now
You crossed the line so baby get the hell out

[Chorus:]
But it's you talking dirty
When I'm trying to sleep
And it's you, said you love me
After just one week (just one week yeah)

We should take things slow (take things slow)

Make up your mind boy
Silly games you're always playing
Have no time boy
To sit and chase you
I ain't staying
Well, thinking it's funny
Well, you're spending money
And, every time you wanna get the upper hand remember
I'll be walking away looking cool with my
Matching bag and the jewels that I took
Don't you ever say it's not necessary
Then beg to come back
I ain't having that
Oh whoa

Sugababes,"Slow day, might rain
I couldn't hear the weather man
Tight fit don't sit
Even when you loosen it

Your pace, no race
You kind of just to get into it
Was it 'cause we
Never sampled the flavoring?

Someday, baby, we could have it all
(You on me, me on you, smoking till we both turn blue)
A steady speed and we could we have it all
(Me on you, you on me, your kind of boring me to sleep)
But we keep on falling over everything
When you and me, we could have it all

You're street smart with a big heart
You look like your having it
Talk fast, words last
When you look like your diggin' it

But I don't subscribe
To the state that we're living it
Was it 'cause we
We couldn't handle the flavoring?

Someday maybe we could have it all
(You on me, me on you, smoking till we both turn blue)
A steady speed, we could have it all
(Me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep)
But we keep falling over everything
When you and me, we could have it all

Better things are gonna come our way
You know we're gonna make it through this change
We're sitting tight as a tourniquet
Believing we could have it all someday

Someday, baby, we could have it all
(We could have it all, we could have it all)
(You on me, me on you, smoking till we both turn blue)
A steady speed and we could have it all
(Me on you, you on me, you're kind of boring me to sleep)

Sugababes,"Did it start with an obsession
Was the writing on the wall
I can see through your deception
Through it all, I see clearly now
Far too long you've had your way
For too long I tiptoed around
Finally we're face to face boy
No drama now, I'll stand my ground

Now the conversation's over
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now, I won't stay
It's my turn to walk away

No point in talking round in circles
Or trying to read between the lines
I saw you dancing with the devil
I'm not blind, don't sympathize
It's far too long you've played your own game
Far too long I stood and cried
It's time to change the combination
I'll be fine, won't change my mind

Now the conversation's over
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now, I won't stay
It's my turn to walk away

I've found the strength to finally say it
What it was, it hurt a thousand times
And now there's no more pain
I'm no longer insane
I've reconnected my mind

Now the conversation's over
And there's nothing more to say
I've had my time with you
So hear me now, I won't stay

Sugababes,"Seven hours since you went away
11 coffees
Ricki Lake on play
But late at night
When I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I'd think of you
Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from the telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home
He said

Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
Run away
Why'd you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
I said OK
Cause

Ooh boy d'ya miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

11 hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night
I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
Seven hours what you calling for
A bunch of flowers
And I'll slam the door
You're in my face
Sorry what's your name
Takes more than begging
To reverse my brain

Ooh boy d'ya miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed
Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

Through with it
Over it
Not having it
This crazy shit
Been feeling this
Indelicate
No more, no more
I'm through with it
Not having it
This crazy shit
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more of it
No more, no more

Breaking off the brunt
Brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go ""ooh""
Doesn't mean I'm running with you
Don't you dare tear back
Can't you see I won't take that
I ain't crying now over you
Better free your head up
Like  I told you

Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
Run away
Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
I said OK
Cause

Ooh boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head?

I have your name print tattooed upon my skin

If this universe is really shrinking

It looked like heaven but the colors seemed to change
And no matter what I do yeah

You won't know you missed it
And its ok if I'm a little bit crazy
Am I a little bit insane well maybe
And it's just a little something
But I'd rather be me than nothing
And it's ok if I'm a little bit crazy
It doesn't mean I can't be a lady

Now I'm the kind of girl who knows her biz
Flirtatious in a way but it depends on how I feel
Still I keep it classy, stay with a guy that's real
‘Cos if he ain't supporting
Then he's not the real deal, check it
I'm forever getting misunderstood
Always been a leader not a puppet, it's good
Before the music game there was me and that's it
I've never been the one to fight but I won't take it

I'm not the type to say just get out my face

Please, its not OK, to invade my space

'Cause it's doin' it for me
Is it makin' you crazy?
That I'm happy?
Lately, you ain't doin' it for me

Now let me break it down
And tell you what it means to me
I don't want to spend my time in the V.I.P
I've gotta meet someone who doesn't need publicity

'Cause your style this time ain't impressin' me
And you can justify everything
But it don't really matter when reality kicks in
So tell me what to say and I'll deliver it
I won't stop, can't stop, 'cause I'm feelin' it

Torn between sun and rain

Nothing more 'cause life is how I wanted to be
With you and me
Staying together, yeah

Take it all, I'm here boy
I got what you need here, talk to me
And help me breathe
I wanna hold on
To sweet memories

It's wasting time until your heart and mind realizes I am the one
I can't disguise my love for you-It's true I can't

Wait for you to be there
All my life, I need
Someone to make me feel good
And I wish that it was you

Every journey an other sign
Images always pass me by
Feel like leaving the walk behind
When I think of you

Every moment I'm fighting this
Had to erase all your messages
Couldn't handle the things we said
Still I'm feeling you

It's driving me crazy, baby
Lately you've been slipping away from me
I try to keep holding on
I cannot be wrong
There's something I didn't see

We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop
Every time a change of heart
I can't keep up
When you say yes then I say no
When it turns hot, we make it cold
But still something between us holds together

We break up and make it up
Back and forth we never stop

I think our time is over
Ain't how funny how sweet I dream
But the bed keeps on getting colder
Sometimes when I close my eyes
It feels like I'm living by numbers
'cause I've been holding you so damn tight
I gotta stop 'cause it's pulling me under

They said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was OK
They said you're more beautiful

So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous 'cause

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
'Cause I didn't know my body would change
I grew taller than them in more ways
But there will always be the one who will say
Something bad to make them feel great

Hand in the heart (oo-oo-oooooo-oo...) 
You have to look it in the face 
And recognize it's you that makes you
Stronger in every way 
Each day a brand new play
I never hear you say I won't believe tomorrow 

In dark there's no believing
You're only left with fear
Talk me out of right from wrong 
Make me sing a different song 
No time to hide, I'll move on...

Tell me that my heart won't break
I don't wanna let it go

Never felt this empty before
I can't take it no more
'cause I noticed, we ain't got that closeness
Like the way we had it before
Baby open the door

Lately all the thrill is gone
Everything I do is wrong
You keep pouring water on these flames inside
Can we make it like brand new
Baby trust me and you
'cause I can't go on like this another night

I can't wait, tell me 'for it gets too late
Tell me that my heart won't break

But you see through me easily
I can't take the ups and downs
Take my hand, say you'll turn it around

Lost like I can't go on
Yeah, my pride's still intact, no danger of that
It must hurt to know you're wrong

No better to let you see them now
My wasted heart
Will never learn to drive the demon down

When you love the devil
You sell your soul
And it's hard to let it go

Undignified
I am tonight

So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified

It terrifies me to think I'm not the only one
You'd be surprised how much I cry when you are gone

When your angel's the devil
Your church is a tomb
But I need to be with you

I'm undignified
Enough for two

So give me false hope and promise me you'll try
To redeem yourself for the hundreth time
Lie to me if you must my dear
Give me a reason to have here
Even false hope allows me to still believe
In this powerful love that's consuming me
I'm hooked on a drug that steals your pride
It's hard not to seem so undignified

I'm addicted to the pain and pleasure you give
It's not how I wanna live
Controlled by him

I rehearsed a little speech, but the whole thing got too preachy

I memorized it piece by piece, but I guess it's not that easy 
Now it seems like I'm back on scratch again

Sugababes,"Boy 1 was famous from TV
He carved my name into a tree
First cut's the deepest
And I left him bleeding

Boy 2 had earned a law degree
He charged me with a felony
I stole his heart
And pled insanity

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Boy 3 worked at the cemetery
His crooked smile was kinda sweet
All things must end
Now he is 6 feet deep

Boy 4 was filthy rich indeed
He flew a private jet but see
He crashed and burned
There's just no buying me

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Boy 5 composed a symphony
Strings and choir just for me
Then he turned deaf
It was a tragedy

Boy 6 lived in a monastery
He chose a life of poverty
I chose Chanel
So much for chastity

I know
Nothing lasts eternal in life
But love hurts forever

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Boy 7 was a don of all Sicily
He tried to kiss
And tell on me so now he
Sleeps with the fishes, arrivederci baby

Last boy was a director on a silver screen
He went and wrote a slasher flick just for me
When he said cut
I took it literally

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Every heart that's broken is a murder one
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
Have mercy on me, now the deed is done
'Cause every heart that's broken is a murder one

Christmas comes this time each year

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that we've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

Just a little bob sled he calls Little Saint Nick
But she'll walk the toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

Haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen reindeer with the Rudy the lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Sugar Ray,"He was the heavyweight king at the age of 21
From the streets of New York where they're all called mean
He never had no mom, never had no dad
His aunt and Constantine D'Amato was all he ever had

But he found his pot of gold consequently came Given's
When they broke up it was him that was givings
And we'd like to build him up but we love to see him fall
Finally taken down by your hooker by the jaw

It was a battle of brains, a battle of wit
So my man got his man skilled Alan Dershowitz
But he left him out to dry, the judge was a fool
Using this case as publicity tool

So it's off to cell to meet the prison staff
The first thing they do they want his autograph
And I just laugh cause he suffered the wrath
Now the man added time to his liberty path

[Chorus]

I heard he gets a lot of visits, still he's got no family
But he gets a lot of love from the kids in Jodeci
What does he raise our sons kid on our new T.V
Same name but you don't look similar to me

But that's another story, I'm gettin' off track
But when he gets out I think you better watch your back
I said now when he gets out I think you better watch your back

Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Sugar Ray,"Now this is somethin' from back in the day
I'll always remember Run DMC
And all the good times
That we had on the beach
Stealing sips from a paper cup
And making out in the sand
Maybe I'm dreaming
Can you tell me

Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)

I'll always remember everything we do
Rockin' the eighties blastin' K-R-O-Q
I remember Culture Club
The Clash, and Men Without Hats
Seems kind of funny right now
But it's taking me back
We'd always sing along
And laugh out loud at ourselves
Don't want to stop dreaming
Can you tell me

Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)

I want to rewind every time
'Cause the words have so much meaning
They were there when nobody cared
Always knew what I was feeling
Stay tonight don't leave me reminiscing
All I do is wind up missing you
Are you missing me
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Are you missing me (Na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Waiting for the night to change your ways 
There are days missing in my week again 
And there's not a cloud in the sky 
But my view from the Hollywood Roosevelt 

Makes me feel like I can fly 
I should maybe make some apologies 
And I probably should fix my hair 
But I might just stay another night 
If my credit card's still down there 

Oh yeah, all right 
I feel like a 100 million dollars tonight 
I knew you were the one 
But I kept you waiting 
Kept you waiting 

Anticipating now I'm waiting for you 
I think I'll go see my friends tonight 
Who live just a little bit up Crescent Heights 
And sometimes we stay out all night 

Feels like there's nothing that we can't do
I'm never really sure that I'll ever change 
But if it makes you happy then I will lie 
She looked at me and softly said 

I'm going to love you till the day I die

This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world.

Black top, blue sky
Big town full of little white lies
Everybody's your friend, you can never be sure
They promise fancy cars and diamond rings
All sorts of shiny things
Girl, you'll remember what your knees are for

Dear Mom and Dad,
Please send money,I'm so broke that it ain't funny.
I don't need much just enough to get me through.
Please don't worry cause I'm alright
I'm playing here at the bar tonight.
This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world.
Love,
Your baby girl

I know that I'm on my way
I can tell every time I play
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say

Dear Mom and Dad,
I'll send money, I'm so rich that it ain't funny
It ought ta be more than enough to get you through
Please don't worry cause I'm alright
I'm staying here at the Ritz tonight
What ta ya know we made our dreams come true!
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing
They all add up to nothing compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world.

Had it with the wife thing, living on a shoe string
What's a poor girl got to do just to have some fun?
All these years without any help
Guess what, honey, clothes just don't wash themselves!
Neither do dishes, neither does the bathroom floor

So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
I'll be down in Mississippi and up to no good

No more, what a bore, had enough, I'm out the door
Headed for a breakdown, had it with the small town
Gonna call Lisa, gonna call Carla Sue
Now we're gonna let it roll, gonna let it rip
Gonna get us a nice room down on the strip
Not that we'll need it, there won't be any sleepin' tonight

So, now if anyone asks, not that they would
We'll be down in Mississippi and up to no good

Hammer down, here we go
Runnin' for the riverboat
All you're gonna see is asses and elbows
Luck's about to change for these three queens
Tired of getting' jokers, deal us up kings

Snake eyes, roll the dice, double down and hit me twice
Cashin' in the big chips, gonna leave a big tip
Hotter than a two dollar pistol, baby, I'm on fire

In the house where my mama was raised

And in every wind that blows there's a song of letting go 
It's not goodbye, it's hello 

When we met underneath the blue skies of summer 
And those summer skies turn into fall 
That sweet September wind made us so much more than friends 

On Night

And we ran through those cottonwood trees 
We made love in a big bed of fresh fallen leaves 
And in every wind that blows there's an innocence that knows 
It's not goodbye, it's hello 

In the moment that one thing ends 
Is the same time that one begins 
And return as we must 
We are ashes to dust, amen. 

When the days of my youth have all faded 
And the memories are all that remain 
Let that old September wind take me back to where I've been

Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door

Let's turn off the phone
I don't want to go to work today
Or even put my makeup on
I've got better things to do
Than my to do list anyway
Hide under the covers
And waste away the day

Let's just lay here and be lazy,
Baby drive me crazy
All I want to do
All I want to do
Is love you

I got my whole life to change the world
And climb the ladders
Looking at you looking at me
Is the only thing that matters
Come a little closer baby,
We can talk without the words
Hang a sign on the door,
Please do not disturb

Give me a kiss, from that Elvis lip,

Which hands you shake and which hands you hold

And hangout, make lots of noise
Lay out and hang with the boys
Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along

I was already gone
I was already gone

Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me. the first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
""Girl, don't you lose your heart yet""
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burning me up, but still I held on

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

The last time I see him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We split the blame for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone

But I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone

Lay out late with a boy

Breaks down so strong it
Leaves footprints on the street
And theres too many miles to face
Without a few more hours sleep
The storm clouds overhead wont shed
Any rain to quench your thirst
I wanna be the one you reach for first

You can see right through your soul
And you cant find a nickel to buy a smile cause all your pockets all got holes
You wanna shut the door and
Hide before the day can get much worse

Before you're reaching for the sky
Before your searching for direction

Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl

From the edges of my eyes and my ears.

What it brought is neon lights in crowded bars
Like all the Kings with all their gold
Went chasin' down your star, I'm told
Every highway takes me where you are
With this little wood guitar

I never stopped believin'
I just kept on singin'
Now people come to hear from miles around
And I don't mind confessin'
But I still count my blessin's
I just never thought I'd settle down

It's Christmas day
And the little ones are wakin'
I hear them play
I can hear the presents shakin'
A boy's outside on his new bike
Janglin' in the street
A little girl, she's watchin' him
That wood box beneath her feet

All she got is this little wood guitar
What I thought is it might take her pretty far
Like all the Kings with all their gold
Went chasin' down your star, I'm told
Every highway takes me where you are
With this little wood guitar

Sugarland,"Every Christmas I come back to this town
I come lookin' through some lost and found
Wondering if you're still hanging around down here

Well the hung day lights, they line these streets
Where I once loved you, and you once loved me
I'm sorry, it just gets to me

I wonder if I called up your house
If your Momma would let you out
Maybe baby, I'll see you this Christmas
What do you say?
Or maybe baby, I'll see you on New Years day

I remember your eyes with the snow outside
You said this place always looked a little better in white
I wanna look up and see your face one more time

Feels like the clock stopped ticking the day I left
I think of you and I catch my breath
I'm sorry, you still get to me

I wonder if you'll be going out
There's only one party in this town
Maybe baby, I'll see you this Christmas
I hope and pray
Or maybe baby, I'll see you on New Years day

Baby it's so strange being back here again
I keep runnin' into our old friends
This old town ringing in one more year
I don't wanna let this feeling disappear

I pray that you might be here tonight
And there you were standing shining underneath that light
Screaming at the ball on the TV countdown
Streamers and papers piling up on the ground

Baby did you come alone?
Are you maybe looking for someone?
To kiss you
God I've missed you
Maybe baby, we didn't get Christmas
But if you stay
Maybe baby, we could have New Year's day

Maybe (maybe)

We're happy tonight

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown

He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man""
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Play it snowbirds, hey!

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold

Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic

You deserve the best in life

Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself

Suicidal Tendencies,"I wrote the letter just the other day to nobody in particular
But if anyone were to read a bit - they'd think I was a bit pecular
But in matters not what they think of me, it's only what I know is real
And so that's left that matters now - is that the feeling's back 

The feeling's back and you just can't stop it
The feeling's back and you just can't stop it 

I fought a thousand times, I never knew the meaning of the word fear
Till that one day when I stood alone, staring straight in the mirror 

It's not a pretty sight, and even worse it's so hard to face
Until I realize I'm the only one that put me in this place 

The feeling's back and you just can't stop it
The feeling's back and you just can't stop it 

I'm gonna breathe I'm gonna live - that's right - nothing's gonna stop me
I'm gonna shout I'm gonna scream - that's right - nothing's gonaa stop me
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna fly - that's right - nothing's gonna stop me
I'm gonna fight I'm gonna win - that's right - nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing's gonna stop me, nothing's gonna stop me now - cause the feeling's back 

And you gotta love the feeling
I dug my hole too deep, I couldn't admit, I didn't know when to stop
But you can only dig your hole six feet until the dirt comes back to top
I've got a long way left to climb but I'll still look you straight in the eye
And I can honestly say I'll never quit - not even on the day I die

Suicidal Tendencies,"Got home kind of late last night
My mind wasn't clear, but I could tell something wasn't right
So silent I could hear my heart pump
But then I heard a sound that made me jump 

I tried to get real brave, tried to look around
I tried to find out from where came that sound
The more I looked, the less I could see
But the voices keep calling, calling out of me 

I hear voices, when I'm all alone
Hearing voices, but there's nobody home
Hear the voices, could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices, I look why can't I see 

I hear voices, can't stop those voices 

It happened again, the very next day
I still couldn't understand what they were try to say
Could only get the courage to open up one eye
Couldn't see nothing, but the voices they don't lie 

I search and search but not a soul I found
Pretty damn sure no one was around
The more I looked the less I could see
Then I realized the voices were calling from me 

I hear voices, when I'm all alone
Hearing voices, but there's nobody home
Hear the voices, could it be they're calling out of me
Hearing voices, I look why can't I see 

Are they demons, or are they angels or am I crazy 

Now the voices I start to understand
They have to do with the Master plan
You think about what you'd do
Cause one day the voices will be calling out to you
The voices I hear now I know are true
They come not from one but they come from two
The real point is what I'm missing
From which voice will I listen 

I hear voices
Hearing voices
Do you hear the voices?
Can't stop the voices",Hearing Voices
Suicidal Tendencies,"Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help but no one's around
Silently screaming I bang my head against the wall
It seems like no one cares at all
Always an emotion, but how can I explain
How can I explain
Kind of like the scent of a rose
With words I can't explain
The same with my pain
Caught up in emotion-Goes over my head
Goes over my head
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death
Am I living or am I dead
The clock keeps ticking but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And when I think about all the times that I've had
So few good-So many bad
I search for personality and I look for things I can not see

Love and peace flash through my mind
Pain and hate are all I find
Find no hope in nothing new
Never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony
Through my eyes that's all I see
If I'm gonna cry
Will you wipe away my tears?
If I'm gonna die
Lord please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow
Last thing that I'll say
How will I laugh tomorrow
If I can't even smile today
Today today, when I can't even smile today

Suicidal Tendencies,"Why do I wake up in the morning-nothing's changed since the day of my birth
Why do I wake up in the morning-I make no difference on this earth

Strength has left-has to be-something has died inside of me
If I don't wake up in the morning-at my funeral would anyone care
If I don't wake up in the morning-would anyone even be there

You can put me down-you can put me out, you can try to ignore
But now you're gonna hear me when I shout WAKE UP

Why should I wake up in the morning-it be just another wasted day
Why should I wake up in the morning-don't do nothing right anyway

That was then-not anymore-now I go blasting out the door
I'm gonna wake up in the morning-I'll prove you wrong I will not fail
I'm gonna wake up in the morning-I'm gonna blaze a brand new trail

Might not be smart, but if I'm strong
I know for sure no one ever will prove me wrong",If I Don't Wake Up
Suicidal Tendencies,"I sailed forever, I sailed so far, and now I know just what the consequences are
I laughed out loudy, while I cried inside
But I didn't haave the strength to say enough of this ride
Like a fool-I believed in a miracle
I wanted to forget, of what I'm not sure
But I found an answer-it seemed to be a perfect cure

Controlled my actions, controlled my thoughts
Controlled my feelings, and now I feel my body rot-like a fool
I believed in the miracle

Twisting and I'm turning-freezing then I'm burning
Laughing then I'm crying-am I living or am I dying
Swearing then I'm praying-don't even know what I'm saying
Happy then so sad-forgiving then so mad

Do you still, do you still believe, do you still believe in,
Do you still believe in miracles?

Pushing then pulling-who am I fooling
A friend then a foe-do I really even know?
Love and then hate
Peace then at war-but what am I fighting for
And you always try to
Keep me-oh so sleepy
So I can't realize-that it's all lies
And the more it takes hold of me-the less chance that I'll ever be free
And even though I don't believe-it's so hard to leave-a miracle-a miracle

Waiting-always hesitating-for that perfect day-that day was yesterday
And the more you're gonna wait-the more of a chance that it will be too late

How can you afford to wait, you just can't afford to wait
I shed a tear I won't deny it, but just one tear I already cried it
And now you'll see me cry no more, don't even know what I was crying for",The Miracle
Suicidal Tendencies,"Never good at talking, so many things I couldn't say
But those thoughts never went away
And I'm sure you remember, said that all I wanted was sympathy,
Now add this to your memory

Too many times-I felt so sad and lonely
Too many times-I needed someone there
Too many times-I tried to tell you something
Too many times-It seemed like no one cared

And I don't like asking-and it's not easy to say-
I never learned how to pray
So if you have a moment it means so much to me oh can't you see-
If you'd just say a prayer for me

Too many times-I didn't even have a second
Too many times-you thought I was much too strong
Too many times-you said the feeling wouldn't last forever
Too many times-I proved you so damn wrong

Saw the changes-thought they'd go away-do you still remember that day
Can't really fault you-only have myself to blame-
But do you still feel the same

Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
But I waited so long-for someone to take my hand, and say they understand

And I waited so long-for someone to show the way-to make a better day
and I waited so long-for someone to spare a kiss for the love I miss
And I waited so long-for you to looke me in the eye
And say it's worth another try
But yo keep me waiting-waiting-too many times

You keep me waiting, one too many, one too many, one too many times,
Too many times
One too many one too many one too many times too many times

9. Feeding The Addiction

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

You haven't eaten in days and your gums are bleeding
Swearing to God the pipe's all you're needing
It's robbing or stealing or turning a trick
You do whatever it takes to suck on the Devil's dick

The more you feed it, the harder it is to tame
Taking in the Beast, playing it like a game
Lying to yourself saying the same old shit
""I don't need it, I just don't want to quit""

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

The hunger of addiction calls
There's nothing romantic about going through withdrawals
You're craving a sample well, here's just a taste
Picking and scratching the scabs on your face

Your life support system's a syringe
Killing a piece of your soul every time you binge
Praying to God and begging for forgiveness
Knowing damn well that you can't keep going on like this

This is addiction
Feed the addiction
This is addiction

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

I won't give up the plot but here's a few surprises
Muscle spasms, you're puking as your temperature rises
Led off to slaughter like a heard of cattle
The demons inside have won the battle

The Devil takes another soul to burn
What does it take for another fool to learn
The ritual's over as another one dies
The ritual begins as another one tries

It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
Feeding...the monster!

Cursing at God and praying to die...

Summer Cem,"Feierabend Mutterficker, wir sind mitten im Geschehen
Nordrhein, Westside, heute ficken wir das Game
Deutschland, ich will eure Mittelfinger sehen
Eure Mittelfinger sehen, eure Mittelfinger sehen

Ihr wolltet mir nicht glauben, doch die Wahrheit kommt ans Tageslicht
2010, Deutscher HipHop wird in Arsch gefickt
Deutschland, ich will eure Mittelfinger sehen
Eure Mittelfinger sehen, eure Mittelfinger sehen

Ey, alles was ich will, ist Hugo Boss und Donatella Versace
Tausende Euros und einen Dönerteller mit Raki
Denn die Straßen, die Ghettos, von denen wir zwei erzählen
Sind wie Frauen in der Schwangerschaft, denn sie haben keine Regel
Und während Öko-Rapper wie Marteria auf Sieben gehen
Frage ich mich, wovon der Penner Reason lebt
Gas, Wasser, Strom und wie es um die Miete steht
Ob er das Merchandise macht oder die Fliesen legt
Ihr kommt mit Schwächlingen, ich komme mit Häftlingen
Die die Zelle schließen und dich zum oralen Sex zwingen
Deine Fans schreien „Cem, kopf Hoch du Spinner
Die Hauptsache ist, du bist nicht gottlos wie Silla!“
Rapper wollen Smalltalk wie Letterman und Oprah
Doch ich muss leider kacken also pass mir mal dein Poster
Setz dich doch aufs Sofa, mach Geschäfte mit dem Koka
Und das geht reibungslos so wie Sex mit einer Oma

Alter fick auf Rap, ich bin back im Drogengeschäft
Und mache Kohle mit Pep, Schore und Crack
Zahl' im Rotlicht für Sex, werd' als Killer gesucht
Und ihr wisst, dass ich zäh bin, wie der Finger im Fuß
Als ich noch Straßendieb war
Sahst du den Dietrich im Schloss,
Als wäre er ein Adeliger
Und als ich Gras gedealt hab, mit dem Messer in der Jeans
Wollten Rapper noch kein Beef mit den Gangstern aus der Street
Ruth Moschner ruft an, denn sie hätte gern nen Gee
Kurz darauf bin ich bei Ruth wie der Backup von Massiv
Deutschen Rappern das Leben mit ner Kugel nehmen
Is ein Kinderspiel wie Reise nach Jerusalem
Souverän werde ich dich Hundesohn wichsen
Ich geh zum Grab deiner Mutter um die Nutte zu ficken
Denn Papa wartete auf mich nachdem die Cops daheim waren
Mit dem Gürtel in der Hand wie Boxweltmeister

Feierabend Mutterficker, wir sind mitten im Geschehen

Ihr wolltet mir nicht glauben, doch die Wahrheit kommt ans Tageslicht

Eure Mittelfinger sehen, eure Mittelfinger sehen

Während ihr nach den Sternen greift wie Ninjakämpfer
Fick ich Kinderschänder, ich bleib' für immer Gangster

Und da diese Prominutten gerne vögeln und Schwanz saugen
Fick' ich Gülcan und lasse sie Brötchen bei Kamps kaufen

Gerade raus aus dem Knast, wird das Rauschgift verpackt
Ich bin dein Idol, weil ich keine Ausbildung hab'

Ey, jetzt kommen die beiden Ticker, wir haben die Scheine sicher
Denn du liegst nur auf der faulen Haut, so wie Leichenficker

Das ich hundert fahr' in der Dreißiger-Zone
Da leg' ich Wert drauf, wie auf meine Schreibtischkomode

Ey ich habe die Schore mit meinem Freund Ismet im Angebot
Doch du bist im Real und fragst „Is' Mett im Angebot?“
Und im Sommer fährst du Segeln mit nem Wohnwagen
Doch was meine Kindheit prägte
Waren die Schläge mit dem Stromkabel

Farid trägt Waffe, C-Klasse, was willst du Pimmel
Denn wer nix zu verlieren hat, der kann nur gewinnen

Feierabend Mutterficker, wir sind mitten im Geschehen

Und bin nur auf dem Holzweg, wenn ich auf Parkett geh,

Summer Cem,"Ihr Name war Anabell , doch sie hört auf den Namen Aisha
Sie liebte den Namen denn den bekam sie von Isa
Isa war weder Schläger noch ein Dealer
Nur ein Junge der sein Abitur macht und kurz vor dem Ziel war
Er wollte Arzt werden Inschallah Hoffentlich
Und sprach so gutes Deutsch das selbst der Lehrer aus den Socken kippt
Aishas Vater Frank der eigentlich ein Trottel ist
Vertraute Isas langem Bart und den Locken nicht
Aisha das Mädchen das man nie auf Partys sah
Verliebte sich in den Jungen aus Afghanistan
Das letzte mal vor 10 Jahren die Heimat gesehen
Er war gläubig und verpasste nie ein Freitags Gebet
Doch Isa macht ihr klar sie sei zu nichts verpflichtet
Denn nur wegen ihm hatte sie auf Schweinefleisch verzichtet
Von anderen wurde sie aufgezogen
Weil sie kein Bock hatte sich auszutoben
Denn nur für Isa hat sie sich aufgehoben 

Es ist schicksal, Es ist kismet
Mal bist du oben mal am Boden und du frisst Dreck was für eine kranke Welt
Sie hat doch nichts angestellt
Alles nur damit sie ihrem Mann gefällt
Oh Aisha
Nie wieder Partys und Feten
Salami und Bacon
Haramoaleykum
Warst du zu naiv oder einfach nur verliebt
Oh Aisha ich hoffe das du uns vergibst

Es war Anabell die Jüngste Tochter von Familie Klein
Papa Manager, Mama intressierte Malerei
Isa hingegen wohnt nicht grade in einem Traumhaus..
Papa Fabrikarbeiter, Mama Hausfrau
Seine Eltern waren eher konservativ
Und wollten nie das er sich in eine Blonde verliebt
Doch aus Liebe zu Isa konventiert sie zum islam
Und das obwohl Familie Klein nicht viel hielt von dem Koran
Öf und an Ramazan fastet sie geheim
Sie sagt, ich habe keinen Hunger, Mama lass mich jetzt allein
Aisha sagt diese Liebe hier hält Gott zusammen
Und für meinen Mann ziehe ich auch ein Kopftuch an
Keiner wollte helfen, keiner wollte es einsehen
Sie taten doch nichts Schlimmes, doch mussten sich geheim sehen
Und sie wurden schwach sie konnten nicht mher länger
Mitten in der Nacht und dann hat er sie geschwängert

Es ist schicksal, Es ist kismet
Mal bist du oben mal am Boden und du frisst Dreck was für eine kranke Welt
Sie hat doch nichts angestellt
Alles nur damit sie ihrem Mann gefällt
Oh Aisha
Nie wieder Partys und Feten
Salami und Bacon
Haramoaleykum
Warst du zu naiv oder einfach nur verliebt
Oh Aisha ich hoffe das du uns vergibst

Nach 3 Wochen war die Schwangerschaft bestätigt
Und Isa wurde klar jetzt ist er erledigt
Also ging er zu seinem Vater und fragte ihn nach Rat
Doch der Vater sagt, „Haram ab nach Afghanistan“
Isa ahnt was kommt und verflucht sein Leben
Ruft Aisha an und sagt, alles wird gut, mein Baby
Er verspricht ihr den allerersten Flug zunehmen
Wenn er zürück ist, ziehen sie in eine gute Gegend
Doch er konnte seinem Vater keine Widerworte geben
Und arrangierte Ehen waren in ihrem dorf die Regel
Er wusste von der Tradition doch hat er sowas nicht erwartet
Zwangsehe mit der Cousine 3. Grades
Und als Isa aus dem Flieger steigt, sieht man Aisha weinen
Gott sei dank, endlich kommst du wieder heim
Sie erzählt von ihren Plänen für das Kinderzimmer
Doch bemerkt dann seinen Ring am Finger",Aisha

Da komm' ich ungelegen als würd' ich im Stehen ficken
Schicke dich heim, nachdem ich dein Schädel klatsch'
Und dein Mann sagt: „Hattest du nicht eben Zähne, Schatz?“
Und ich übertreib
Doch ist dein Arsch auf Diät oder warum schiebt man Gemüse rein?
Ich verführe drei Bitches aus Antalya
Viagra, Kokain, Sucuk und Champagner
Farid Bang aka der für Euros drohende
Nimmt die Rapper auf den Arm als wären sie Neugeborene
Ich benutz 90 Kondome und dass ich Mädchen schlag

Denn bevor ich dir die Hand geb' würd' ich lieber heute sterben
(Du weißt, dass) es ein Massaker auf dem Asphalt gibt
Blut an deinen Händen, wenn die Kugel deinen Hals trifft

Als ich das allererste Mal vor dem Richter log
Und ihm weiß machen wollte, ich vertick' kein Dope
Performte dieser eine „Till ab Joe“
Als der King of Rap machte, war ich King of Koks

Als ich das allerletzte Mal den Typ mit der Maske sah
Da ging ich kurz in mich und dachte, estagfurulllah
Denn als er damals noch bei Viva „Mein Block“ performte
War ich Dealer und musste die Stadt mit Stoff versorgen

Ah Bruder, guck meinen Freund an
Nur noch eine Anzeige und dann heißt es „Goodbye Deutschland“
Ab in die Heimat, Hände küssen, Marhaba
Welcome to Turkey, abkacken in Malatya
20.000 Dollar sparen, danach gibt kein Problem
Mit falschem Pass über Holland wieder reinkommen
Seriös werden und nicht auffallen
Eine zweite Wohnung mieten und mit Staub handeln
Ich bin die Fotzen am Rasieren, Rheydt-West Inkasso
Klingeln, Klopfen und Kassieren
Sitz im Chefsessel mit einem Dreckslächeln
Dönerteller mit Cacık, Geschäftsessen
Autos schieben über die Grenze zu Polen
Papiere fälschen und Cousins rüberholen
Aufstehen, rausgehen, schnappen wie ein Kanakk
Sei einfach du selbst und mach es wie ein Kanakk

Auf alles scheißen und sich Benehmen wie ein Kanakk

Ey, was für Kräfte messen?
Ich schick deiner Mutter eine SMS
In der Hoffnung einen wegzustecken
Komm in dein Haus, um zu schlafen
Leg mich ins Bett deiner Schwester und flüster
„Weck mich auf, wenn ich schnarche“
Es ist SC, der beste und Nummer Eins
Geh mit deiner Visakarte shoppen und du unterschreibst
Direkt danach mach ich’s mit Katharina
Steige in den Jet und fick in Katar Ina
Ich brauch weder einen Partner noch einen scheiß Berater
Mache Cash mit der Mentalität von Michaels Vater
Sitze im Café mit Babbos aus Batman und Muş ili
Wie ich sehen kann bist du kleiner Bastard im Plus
In deinem Pass steht Volker, doch du machst auf Volkan
Ich will nur mein Hack, wo ist mein bol sans
Aufstehen, Rausgehen, Verchecken wie ein Kanakk
Arm zur Welt komm', reich verrecken wie ein Kanakk

Und du denkst, wie der rappt, das kann doch wirklich nicht mehr menschlich sein
Ist es auch nicht, ich bin Optimus Prime, lauf bewaffnet in den Gottesdienst rein
Nein, war nur ein Scherz, jeder Part so pervers, Lichtjahre entfernt
Oft hab ich die Hand am Mic, doch wenn ich dir die Pumpgun zeig
Und dir vor die Füße baller, tanzt du den Gangnam Style
Ich bin der Baba, Barbie, ich komm für Bargeld
Doch wenn du kotzt, bin ich nicht der, der dein Haar hält
Zoom zoom zoom, du musst die Kamera noch scharf stellen

Nichts kann mich stoppen, ich hab nur Paras vor mei'm Vater
Und bin nicht kleinzukriegen wie mein yarrak auf Kamagra

Spitt auf die 808, ich mach sie süchtig, als würden sie Hero nehm'

Kein Spaß eheh, ich bin Rheydter. 
ich sah wie Messer stechen und wie Gewehre knallen, 
sah wie Hände brechen und auch wie Bären fallen. Herzinfarkt, sowas wie dich sah ich das erste Mal. Keine wie du, ich sah schon Tausende Bräute,
 das Gesicht eines Engels doch die Augen vom Teufel. 
Viele sagten ich soll aufpassen, ich mjusste laut lachen. Hallo?! 
Ich bin's Cem der Kanacke mit der Bauchtasche.
Und ich ließ mich auf dich ein, Gott ist groß! 
Doch das zwischen uns beiden das ist hoffnungslos.

Ich hab mich geprügelt und alles ausgeknockt, 
Wie viele Typen hauten mir auf den Kopf. 
Wurde gestochen und es tat nicht weh. 
Ich will gerade stehen doch doch doch

Bei dir wurde ich schwach und vor dir laufe ich weg. 
Denn vor dir habe ich Angst. 
Ich komm nicht vom Fleck denn deine Liebe ist gottlos.
Sie ist gottlos. Ich verliere die Hoffnung. Denn sie ist gottlos.

Vor etwa einer Stunde hab ich dich das erste Mal gesehen und schon kribbelt es im Bauch, etc. PP. Ich würde dir die Wünsche von den Lippen lesen; nichts könnte ich dir abschlagen. Für dich geh ich lächelnd in den Knast und sitze 8 Jahre. Lass uns weg von hier, lass uns die Segeln hissen. Obwohl ich jetzt schon weiß du wirst mein Leben ficken. Du kannst erzählen was du willst; ich glaube dir jede Scheiße und ich habe Angst davor, dass ich noch auf dich kleben bleiben. Ich bin wie ein Räuber ohne Maske, wie ein Killer ohne Waffe. Ich sollte die Finger von dir lassen. Ich will bleiben - ich will gehen - lass mich doch los! Verliere meinen Glauben denn deine Liebe ist gottlos !

Und auf einmal macht sie Schluss, wow. 
Das hört sich super an. Gott sieht alles, Karma kommt zurück wie Boomerang. 
Und sie sagt ich hab's gewusst am Ende wirst du weinen. 
Spar dich deine Worte, du verschwendest meine Zeit. 
Krass, wie jetzt ?! War das alles? Und ich falle, und ich falle, und ich falle. 
Du hast mir versprochen unsere Liebe hält für immer, immer. 
Du, ich, Küche, Bad, Wohn- Schlaf- und Kinderzimmer. 
Ich hab gedacht, alles liegt in meiner Hand, 
Doch deine Liebe macht mich krank. Ich verliere den Verstand. 
Ich habe mit Löwen gekämpft ohne Furcht. 
Ich war der Mann am Block, doch vor dir habe ich Angst, 
Denn du hast keine Angst vor Gott.

Und wachst nicht mehr auf.

Und erzeugt sich wieder auf.

Summer Cem,"Sein Name war Tim
Er war noch ein Kind
Hat seine Lieblingsschuhe an, steht im Garten und winkt
Vanessa zu das Mädchen aus dem Nebenhaus
Sie sagt, lass uns ne Runde drehen, ich kenn' mich in der Gegend aus
Denn Tim war gerade hergezogen und weil er keine Freunde hat
War es Vanessa und sein erster Sommer in der neuen Stadt
Selbe Schule, selber Pausenhof, er hat ihr Kakao geholt
Doch sie steht bei den Älteren und raucht sich eine Marlboro
Vanni war gerade vierzehn als sie schon auf der Piste hing
Denn sie war in der Achten als er noch in die Siebte ging
Armer Tim, er war verliebt auch wenn es witzig klingt
Nicht mehr lange bis sie mit dem ersten in die Kiste springt
Denn sie war reifer, weiter, höher und nicht greifbar
Doch man gewöhnt sich dran zu scheitern
Sie wollte feiern, immer wieder feiern und sie schoss sich ab, ab, ab
Hoch zu den Sternen. Auf der Mädchentoilette hat sie das koksen gelernt
Tim fragt was los ist, doch sie log das nichts wär
Er macht sich Sorgen er will sie nicht verlieren. Verstehste?
Er schwänzt mit Vanni die Schule doch ist dann wenigstens bei Ihr verstehste?
Ein 10er Gras von den Jungs die vor der Hauswand dealen, doch dann sagt er
Moment ich will auch mal ziehen
Er war Fußballer, talentiert im Auswahlteam, wenn alles klappt können wir beide bald ins Ausland ziehen

Jahre sind vergangen, Tim legte eine Pause ein
Ich spiele die nächste Saison Mama, nicht traurig sein
Kannst du mir nen 10er leihen? Ich hab da noch was offen
Ich schwörs ich gib's dir wieder Mama Ehrenwort, versprochen
Die Jeans sind zerrissen, Dreck unter den Fingernägeln
Er muss sich mit Vanessa treffen Dinge regeln
Er war so ein guter Junge dieser Tim
Doch sein Verhängnis war das er mit Ungeziefer hing
Siehst du die Sternschnuppen schweifen in der Ferne?
Wind pfeifft ihm ins Gesicht Zeitung schenkt im Wärme
Blech rauchen im miesen Regen alles der Liebe wegen
Und die Karriere im Auswahlteam ist nie gewesen
Wann bricht es ein dieses wackelige Kartenhaus
Vanni schläft auf der Bank während du noch ihre Haare kraulst
Junkielove in jedem Morgen wird sie wachgeküsst
Das Mädchen dass den Namen jungen Tim mit in den Abgrund riss
Und es ist soweit heute ist sein letzter Tag
Hätte er es gewusst hätte er Mama nochmal fest umarmt
Es war Sonntag doch der Tod hat keine Öffnungszeiten
Du siehst sein Feuerzeug unter seinem Löffel kreisen
Er lag am Boden lief rot an und zuckte schon
Vanessa kriegt nix mit sie hat geschossen und fliegt Richtung Mond
Die anderen Jungs von der Marktplatte schreien: Der ist tot
Das war die Story von Tim Mamas einzigen Sohn

Drück im Aufzug die Taste, fahr mit ihr rauf in den Achten

Mein Schwanz ist auf der Suche nach 'nem Mund, der auf französich spricht

Mr. Schnabel, Cappuchino, hab den Rest schon vergessen

I could never care enough

Fell on her pages found me well

Where Tuscarawas flow into

What about what's good what's true
From those days

So why do I still burn for you
I can't say

Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough in these last days

Heal her soul, carry her, my angel, Ohio

Children bless
And gather round the bed she rests
So poor and cold in their Midwest

My open eyes to lightning storm
The touch of mist felt soft, felt warm
On my face

A star that I just don't see

It was second class but what's to lose
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time

She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to her face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just isn't the case
With time, time, time

Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon

Out there in the halo of the skyline

And all the gifts you gave I have them
And all your love I'm still holding onto

To bathe the loss from your fading eyes

How could I leave this room all alone

She fills their mouths and warms their souls
Till they are strong and good to fly

With a verse so sweetly sung
Into a world we've longed to come

And all her lavender meadows so fragrant and beautiful
And at your dining room table the sun falls on my face so warm
And all the turbulent highways I've taken to get here

how come?

Until the storms come to cease and somehow she's the only one standing

And though we've grown so close my love

Scattered like shells and lost to the sea
Like the river the days move rapidly

I have them and I can't help it

some I will harbor

Rising toward your magical hour
I was not yours and you were not mine

To smell my mother's fragrances and perfumes
To find my young brothers and sisters

I want them to know how I love them so

And ghosts of April ring

Ducking out the window, the school I hate
Listening to my mother talking with her neighborhood friends
Underneath the drone guitar of lucky man

Stranded out those Florida beaches, poor as a joke
Sails fly in Merritt Islands, lazy blue coast
Cool refrains of ocean rain, echo off of my head
Celebrated summer, friends and brothers, the freedom we fell
And you're what I remember

Shining down the L.A. highways, glorious sun
Far from you, from my home, and everyone I love
Sinking in the shallow end of her infinite pools
Silver lakes and palisades and Malibu

Woken up those lost young mornings, somewhere in Spain
I couldn't say the towns I slept, my lovers' names
Pouring in on Sunday, heaven's church bell rang
I didn't know my purpose till I stood and sang
For crowds of passing faces

Blue like the fingernails she wore

Through parks in London, coasts of Perth

We moved together heavenly
So close the North Pacific slept

A million miles now have gone behind me
Walked in the room, soaked up its fumes
Surveyed the faces I am lying to

Gave what I had, I gave my heart
Though I was broken and falling apart
Gave for the memory of a friend
Not for myself and not for them

When I was done I met someone
She came in from the storm so bright and welcome
Her friends came and swept her away
Disappeared like coyotes off on dark high plains

I looked across the river so still
Trying to remember
Where it was last night I laid my head to sleep
Where the empty night hung heavily over

I left Bilbao went to Madrid
To Barcelona, to Pamplona
Where every ghost runs in me now
Haunting me

I flew in over the red clay roofs
And floated through the clouds as they swallowed shut
The bronze tinted landing sea
And houses row the hills like yellowing teeth

When we touched down, opened my eyes to the sun
The dizzying air filled my lungs
And just as soon she woke me
My eyes blurry, my mind heavy

I left Milan I went to Rome
And carried her aroma to Verona
And all the kindness she had shown
Was only a dream

The Flurries down storm cold gray too?
The frozen nights where ignored souls live
As last rays of daylight died
I'm going into my head and clearing my eyes

And as the train pulled away from Cologne
The noise down wire so loudly that it groaned
And as the engines burned through the night
I stared off at far-away lights

I left Berlin and I came home
To sleeping potions and blue oceans
Where my love so selflessly
Awaited me

I long to feel her light so warm
My thoughts racing to the places
Where her room invited me
Awaited me

As the ocean brings in its high tide
As the darkness sets upon the beach
As we drive we look out at black ends
Growing to our windows in old bored stream

Her hair warm Autumn colors, floating
Our days were classroom poems, true young love
Some nights we roar like lions, some we coo like doves

I hummed good sweet explosions? sweet nothings
I broke her heart not knowing she'd return
And graven scars deep in me, forever

In the early morning hours
I hear her though it's silent
Standing over me now

Tonight the skies
Will open for you

She made her perfect gardens in this?

I promised always through me she would shine
I held her hands, I sunk into her heart
Till powers unrelenting, pulled us apart

A million dreams have passed her

Don't cry my love don't cry no more
It overwhelms my breaking heart
A minor swell of violins
I cannot bear to hear them

A mother shepherds her young birds
she fills their mouths and warms their souls
Til they are strong and good to fly
Away from her alone she'll die

Cradle on quiet old oak limbs
As heaven blue her light fails
A breath of soot into her lungs
A life, a journeys end in one

Don't sing that old sad hymn no more
It resonates inside my soul
It haunts me in my waking dream
I cannot bear to hear it

Don't play those violins no more
Their melancholic overtones
They echo off the floor and walls
I cannot bear to hear them",Half Moon Bay
Sun Kil Moon,"In my room at Third and Seneca
See the pigeons peck on tall roof tops
Homeless on the corners, they carouse
Ferries float out in the Puget Sound
Scenesters with their beards and tennis shoes
Skinny girls and pudgy ugly dudes
Lift their amplifiers from the ditches
Southern doormen brood in barroom witches
Seattle black, Alaska blue
Oregon grey, raincloud Vancouver
Dead in Denver, drowsy Idaho
Just dreams away from your love, San Francisco
In my room at Laurel and Beverly
Your mind blossoms, mine is withering
I'm retiring and you're aspiring
You're dream-chasing, I'm only escaping
Blood orange LA, blood red Arizona
Lonestar Sante Fe, lone palm La Pomona
Old soul San Antonio, dry grass of El Paso
Lifetimes away from your love, I know
From my view at 32nd Street
Winter throws its snow down heavily
Empty halls of friends who've come and gone
I'm awoken, rushed, and dragged along
New York, New York, New Haven, Hoboken
The skylines appear spinning past in fast motion
The words we shared dissolved as they're spoken
All the worlds away from my love",Third and Seneca
Sun Kil Moon,"You are my light
Dark cities, you fill the loss
Of the day
You are my love
Radiant and pretty, over seas
You find ways of bringing hope
The lonely hours, gloom of night
Empty mornings
You are a stem, of wild flowers
Rollin' hills, 'round the bay
You are a gap
In the meadow, soaring low
In this way, you are my friend
In the shadows, there to bring
When I need
You are the suites
Of the cellos
There to mend, if I bleed
You are a swing
Sleepy porches, the warm light
On my face
You are a charge, of wild horses
You are the sun
You are my sun
Seeping over, spilling out
Over the mountains
You are my sun

Leona, Leona, Leona
Leona, Leona, Leona
Your fingers
Breathe with grace and ease
A gentle wave
Of guitars playing

Leona, Leona, Leona
Leona, Leona, Leona
Does sense of stares
Light as air
Verses sound, everywhere

Sun Kil Moon,"A pillow lays on cold cement
A blanket by a broken vent
She's there a while
And then she's gone

I'm away for weeks
Arrive at night
She hears my steps
Turns off the light and runs

No mind at all, more space than I need
It's just me among the weeds
Among the ghosts
Among the leaves

We've never met but she's a girl
Romance paper books
The floor is covered
In long blonde curls

On afternoons I walk the graves
The rusted cars, the mine shaft caves
See a girl sadly unkempt
A child of neglect

Under moons I pass the tombs
Cross the highways, smell the fumes
See a girl frighteningly gaunt
Somebody didn't want
How do I tell her I don't care
If she sleeps downstairs?

I see her on my errand runs
Looking nervous like a young Mia Farrow
Walk along the gas stops
Window browsing pawn shops
Guns, bows and arrows
Up on past the Halfway house
Past the signs Eighty South
Buttercup and Carrows
Drinking Wild Irish Rose
At the dead end of the road
Sleeping with the sparrows

When evening comes I play guitar
For the planets and the stars
I leave the porch light on
Like I do when I'm gone
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Basement's yours, have a ball
There's always room for you there
Really baby I don't care",Among the Leaves
Sun Kil Moon,"The hospital called last night
They said you’d gone code silver
They sent the police out searchin'
Found you down at Fifth and Minna
High on crack cocaine
You and Juan Valdez
They sent him back to jail
And they put you back to bed
They called in the mornin' 
Said you were found outside
And put the phone down
Your cat jumped on my lap
And I laid down and I took a nap
Feelin' bad and full of shame
That I somehow contributed to your pain
I wish I could help you with your problems
But babe, I got enough of my own

I fell asleep and dreamed of you
The PA said code blue
I hailed a taxicab
Got there and found you up in west two
My beautiful sweet Elaine
All that was killin' you finally drained
From your sweet angelic face
And I knelled down
And whispered your name

I cried and I cried
You crawled and found a corner
And you died
I ought to kiss my sweet Elaine goodbye
And I walked out in the rain
I walked out in the rain
And there you were again
Lookin' down on me from high
Like a cloud in the sky

I cried and I cried
I remembered all the nights
That I loved my sweet Elaine 
And that I kissed my sweet Elaine
And then I looked up high
Saw you floatin' in the sky
And I cried and I cried
Like a baby I cried

Not much to pick from in my view
Trees that shake when the wind comes through
And boats, I guess, and the water is blue
But I only feel alive when the birds fly

Not much to pick from in my record collection
I sold 'em all away, don’t want no recollection
I put 'em in the past, don’t wanna hear the songs
Just wanna play guitar and sing my own

The phone rang, I picked up, it was you
You said you were out there waitin'
I hailed a taxi, pulled up front
There stood a pretty lady smokin' a cigarette
Lookin' eight pounds heavier
I helped you into the back
And put your bags in the trunk",Elaine
Sun Kil Moon,"It was backstage in Moscow late one night
We shared a cigarette, a kiss goodbye
Her name was Cayenne, so young and soft
Her hands trembled badly, her eyes trailed off
To bottles and objects around the room
My backup guitar, a tray of food

We didn't have very much to say
She said that she'd come from some other place
A town called Troyskirt, maybe Troysworth
I was pretty distracted packing my stuff
But I did make a point to ask her to stay
But she said she had friends that she had to go see

Later that summer I picked up my mail
She sent me a letter with a touching detail
""I used up my minutes calling hotels
To find you that night but to no avail""
""I know it's pathetic,"" she continued to write,
""But that was the greatest night of my life.""",I Know It's Pathetic But That Was the Greatest Night of My Life
Sun Kil Moon,"Pulling my guitar out of its green velvet case
A hundred setlists are staring at my face
And a note from a fan there is stiff and yellow
A notice of inspection from Air Canada

Sitting at the Days Inn hotel, Chicago
Room two-two-two with the ceiling fan low
And I just got in the door from Ontario
And I'm going on tomorrow

I took a walk down to Lincoln Avenue
Got myself a foot massage and a manicure too
And I looked up at the marquee
And hey, it was my name
Next to Julie Holland, think that was her name

Sunshine in Chicago makes me think about my dad
It was eight or nine siblings I am told that he had
When summertime came, his parents put him on a bus
And sent him to his Uncle's in Chicago for three months

Sunshine in Chicago makes me feel pretty sad
My band played here a lot in the nineties when we had
Lots of female fans and fuck, they all were cute
Now, I just sign posters for guys in tennis shoes

Tomorrow I'll get up at a quarter after nine
No itching or burning like I got the other time
My back, it fucking hurts, but otherwise I'm fine

Sun Kil Moon,"Foghorns blowing, all day sirens,
Long trip, still unwinding
Had trouble getting out of bed,
Basked in the grey of fog instead
Phone rang, sun ain't shining,
City I live, uphill and trying
Walked 'round the corner,
Kid said what the zing, that bird has a broken wing,
Sister cracked diamonds in two,
They laughed, that pigeon flew,
Into the street, market at Hyde,
Bus came, that pigeon died

I'm outside, gotta come see you,
There's something I've gotta tell
There's a burning in my body,
Little sip, bro, I'll be well
What kind of man travels and sings?
No kids, no food to bring 
Home in his trunk, home to his stable
Family with a picnic table

Oh melody, why all this?
Why you dodging my every kiss?
Okay, so I brought home a little sting
From a girl who didn't mean anything
Smoked like a chimney, dressed like a witch,
Didn't even speak much English
Met her at midnight, took her in my room,
She didn't even stay past two
Could have been Belgian, could have been French
Could have been Dutch, I didn't get a chance
To get a number, to get a name,
Went to sleep, woke up and got a train

I know you're hating me pretty bad,
But I ain't some tool named Brad,
Up at seven, home by five,
Hasn't got it up since winter time

I really love you more than that, but I'm half man, other half alley cat
I really love you more than that, but I'm half man, half alley cat

Foghorns blowing, cats are hiding,
Goddamn, blue angels flying
Having trouble falling asleep,
Gotta get to the doctor this week
Went to his office, told him about the trip,
Checked it out, wrote me a slip
He said It seem you're too often,
Next time use a little more caution,

Sat me down, had a little chat
Men are men, but we're all half alley cat

Skylines breathing as the sun lies beating down the door

I'm tired of watching the shadows on the wall
My eyes are foreseeing
The shackles open, we're finally free to bolt
If you're done with believing

Hold my fire screaming inside
Hold my flame and set alight
Hold my fire screaming inside out

You won't come with me 'cause you're just too comfortable in chains

Been searching for a long time, in this town
We're looking for a goldmine
So we can get out
To find a place, or waste away

Another day that goes by
Another card, we know we should be grateful
But sometimes it's hard, we're so alone

To get you through, wishing that in time

The news that's on the screen
It's all violence, heartbreak and misery

Sundara Karma,"As I was roaming through
The vast and sacred valley
At the heart of the clearing
I saw a woman who approached me

She had old, wise, tired eyes
And markings on her cheeks
She told me of the meads where enlightenment
Could be achieved

I set off as dawn broke
And I walked on down stream
Whilst my eyes strained to pierce
The haze of my lucid dreams

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open

As I came down from the hills
Away from the crying churned up storm
I saw a land through the deepening dusk
And I knew true, what I had been told

I want this vibrant grass to cover me
If I become too overwrought
For the salvation that I seek
Is trapped in the silence between my thoughts

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open

I don't want to lose the feeling
I've searched so hard to find the meaning
I've found the door and I'm kind of hoping
To use my head and crack it open

I don't want to lose the feeling
I don't want the strange to slip away
And I seek to find true meaning
To find a true and better place to stay
