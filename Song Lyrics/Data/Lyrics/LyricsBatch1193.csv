Suprême NTM,"This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Pour que ça sonne funk
Laisse-moi sampler do funk
Tout d'abord, une première mise au point
Un simple rappel
Je ne suis en aucun cas politicien
Tout au plus chroniqueur, simple reporter
Tuant dans l'?uf le virus de la rumeur
Ceci étant dit, là n'est pas mon seul hobby
Je suis aussi fier de faire partie de la clique
Des MC's au style atypique, qui choque
Vivant au rythme de la musique de notre époque
Le rythme est soûl, jazz ou funkadéklic
Je glisse mes rimes dessus de façon magnifique

Comme une coupure cool Shen, come again come

Systématiquement pris par l'envie
D'un instant funky
Non pas de facétie
Mais plutôt de la basse
Un riddim qui tabasse
Manettes à fond, ça décrasse
Et crée de l'espace
See'est la thérapie que je suis de puis tout petit
Sans comprendre, j'en étais déjà épris
J'en avait déjà l'envie
Ne me doutant pas que ceci tracerait ma vie
Me permettant d'échapper à l'ennui
J'en ai pour toute une vie, so funky
Qui, qui je suis ?
Quoi ! Vous ne m'avez toujours pas remis ?
Moi, gardien de sa survie pour toute la décennie
Moi, contre la perfidie qui jette le discrédit
L'infra-soul, l'infra-jazz, l'infra-funk
Vous avez dit funk ?
Et là je reviens comme un tank
Sur ce groove qui tonne
Voici le new gorgon

Mais quoi ? Quoi, qu'entends-je ?
D'où veinent ces critiques comme quoi le sample serait le sida de la musique
?
Diagnostic morbide anachronique et stupide
Emanant sûrement d'un looser marqué par les rides
Bon, trêve de plaisanterie, je veux do funk
Je veux que ça swingue hardcore, si possible
Donc mettez de côté le côté borné qui vous caractérise
Le rap est un bol d'air pur, un coup de brise phénoménal
Un coup de fouet monumental
Deux cas de figure, bien sûr, le bien le mal
Certains critiquent, d'autres plus malins prennent nos techniques
Même Mick Jagger a fait un hit avec un funky beat
Alors qui conteste et qui change de bord ?
A l'heure où des rock-stars évitent la mise à mort
Grâce notamment à l'apport do sampler dès lors
Le Hip Hop prend sa place et se révèle encore
Beaucoup plus créatif dans tous les domaines
Que ce soit des textes free ou des textes à thème
J'aime quand la mélodie m'amène sur des rythmes funky comme

Je fus tiré do lit par l'emmerdeur de service
Mon voisin do dessus, en bon fan d'Elvis
Passe ses week-ends à foutre à fond
De lives de Memphis
Le pire, see'est que je n'ai quasiment pas dormi de la nuit.
Sache qu'hier au soir, je suis sorti, mec,
Jusqu'à six heures do mat.
Tu peux comprendre ça ?
Ça ne me fait pas plus de quatre heures de sommeil, exact !!
Je vais encore passer la journée la tête dans les vapes.
En plus, j'ai des rendez-vous importants, des interviews...
Ça risque d'être chaud, je suis de mauvaise humeur je l'avoue.
Mais j'assume. Je contrôle.
D'ailleurs, je suis déjà au volant de ma caisse,
Direction les Abesses,
Où j'ai rendez-vous avec
L'homme que l'on nomme Joey, Joey Starr.
Mais j'ai pas fait 500 mètres que les keufs m'arrêtent,
Et me prient de me mettre sur le coté afin de me soumettre
À un contrôle d'identité, simple formalité,
Quand on a ses papiers.
Mais voila, là, je les avais pas sur moi.
J'ai donc été invité au commissariat, où là,
Ils m'ont mis la fièvre pendant, pendant des heures...
MAIS ILS M'ONT MIS LA FIÈVRE...
PENDANT DES HEURES, DES HEURES...
Putain, trois heures maintenant que je l'attends...
Marre de faire la borne kilomètrique comme trop souvent.
Le revoyant, me précisant, en insistant,
Qu'il me faut arriver dans les temps pour un truc important.
Quand apparaît devant moi une bitch.
See'est mal barré pour que je reste planté là,
See'est mal barré, faut que je me décide et fasse mon choix,
Temps de réaction: très net, see'est net.
J'ai plus qu'une seule idée en tête:
Faut que je la serre !!
Avant que ça ne me manque, il faut qu'on fasse la paire.
Mais il faut que je tempère mon excitation,
Car j'ai déjà la fièvre à la vue de ce canon.
Donc sous hypnose, trop contemplatif, je n'ose...
Non, non, non, laissez-moi un peu de temps, see'est pas le bon moment !
Je sais, j'ai pas la journée mais je peux prendre tout mon temps,
Tant il lui plait que je lui fasse do rentre-dedans.
Cette forme qui s'ondule, moi ça j'aime, tant pis pour cool Shen,
Je lache pas, non, j'enchaîne, comme se le doit l'orfèvre.
Jamais, jamais d'un coup deux lièvres.
Alors, pendant des heures...
MAIS ELLE M'A MIS LA FIÈVRE...
PENDANT DES HEURES, DES HEURES...
Oh, mais ils m'ont mis la fièvre, pendant des heures.
Je suis resté assis sur un banc, contre le radiateur.
J'avais pourtant des choses à faire.
J'avais beau leur répéter, mais why'avait rien à faire.
See'était définitivement pas mon jour:
Déjà le rock au réveil, j'étais pas vraiment pour...
Why'a des jours comme ça où tout ne va pas pour le mieux,
Why'a des jours où tout part en couille, tout coule...
Parle pour toi, neShe, car pour moi ce fut terrible,
J'ai passé la journée avec une meuf terrible !!
Une bitch de magazine, beacoup plus bonne que la plus bonne de tes copines!!
Donc, je te laisse imaginer la suite,
Je te fais pas de dessin, ça risque d'être censuré dans le clip,
Mais bon, il n'why eut pas de répit, pas de trève...

Fasse de ces hontes des leçons à bon compte

Tout n'est pas si facile, tout ne tient qu'a un fil
1983, il why a plus de dix ans déjà
Le Hip Hop en France faisait ses premiers pas
Il n'why avait pas de règle, pas de loi
Non surtout pas de contrat
Pas de problèmes entre toi et moi
Tout était clair, do but à la manière
Don't tout devait se faire, naïf, novice, mais tellement fier
D'évoluer dans un système parallèle
Où les valeurs de base étaient pêle-mêle
Peace, Unity, Love and Having Fun
Le Hip Hop n'a jamais eu besoin de gun
Ni de gang, de toys ni de bande
Mais plutôt de la foi de ce qui en défendent
La mémoire et l'éthique, les valeurs essentielles
Celles qui créent encore l'étincelle lorsque je me rappelle
Des premières heures do terrain vague de la Chapelle
A l'époque les héros s'appelaient Actuel
Lucien, Dee Nasty, Tecol et Meo
Big-up, big-up pour être resté aussi longtemps tout en haut
De l'affiche, aussi haut que le flot de mes mots

Des jours et des jours, et des années même

J'espère même qu'elles en ont quand elles sont régiés par l'urgence

De toute façon, j'ai pas le choix et ça aurait pu être pire
Aujourd'hui, ouais, c'est sûr, ouais, c'est plus facile à dire
Vu que tout ça s'est converti en choses nettement plus positives

Marrez-vous jusqu'au jour où vous prendrez conscience
Que nos p'tits frères n'ont plus vraiment la même adolescence
Comparé à nous, le fossé est déjà bien large
Dans certains coins à quinze ans, on est déjà bien barge
Pendant ce temps des pédés font sauter des bombes dans nos océans

Suprême NTM,"A l'aube de l'an 2000
Pour les jeunes c'est plus le même deal
Pour celui qui traîne, comme pour celui qui file
Tout droit, de tout façon y a plus de boulot
La boucle est bouclée, le système a la tête sous l'eau
Et les jeunes sont saoulés, salis sous le silence
Seule issue la rue même quand elle est en sens
C'est pas un souci pour ceux qui s'y sont préparés, si ça se peut
Certains d'entre eux même s'en sortiront mieux
Mais pour les autres, c'est clair, ça s'ra pas facile
Faut pas s'voiler la face, il suffit pas d'vendre des ""kil""
Faut tenir le terrain pour le lendemain
S'assurer que les siens aillent bien
Éviter les coups de surin
Afin de garder son bien intact
Son équipe compacte, soudée,
Écoute de scanner pour garder le contact ou
Décider de bouger, éviter les zones rouges, et
Surtout jamais prendre de congés
C'est ça que tu veux pour ton fils?
C'est comme ça que tu veux qu'il grandisse?
J'ai pas de conseil à donner, mais si tu veux pas qu'il glisse
Regarde-le, quand il parle, écoute-le!
Le laisse pas chercher ailleurs, l'amour qu'il devrait y avoir dans tes yeux

Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

Putain, c'est en me disant ""J'ai jamais demandé à t'avoir!""
C'est avec ces formules, trop saoulées, enfin faut croire
Que mon père a contribué à me lier avec la rue
J'ai eu l'illusion de trouver mieux, j'ai vu
Ce qu'un gamin de quatorze ans, avec le décalage de l'âge
Peut entrevoir, c'était comme un mirage
Plus d'interdit, juste avoir les dents assez longues
Pour croquer la vie, profiter de tout ce qui tombe
La rue a su me prendre car elle me faisait confiance
Chose qui avec mon père était comme de la nuisance
Aucun d'entre nous n'a voulu recoller les morceaux
Toute tentative nous montrait qu'on avait vraiment trop d'ego
Mon père n'était pas chanteur, il aimait les sales rengaines
Surtout celles qui vous tapent comme un grand coup de surin en pleine poitrine
Croyant la jouer fine, il ne voulait pas, ne cherchait même pas
A ranger ce putain d'orgueil qui tranchait les liens familiaux
Chaque jour un peu plus
J'avais pas l'impression d'être plus coté qu'une caisse à l'argus
Donc j'ai dû renoncer, trouver mes propres complices
Mes partenaires de glisse
Désolé si je m'immisce

Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse

Que voulais-tu que ton fils apprenne dans la rue?
Quelles vertus croyais-tu qu'on y enseigne?
T'as pas vu comment ça pue dehors
Mais comment ça sent la mort?
Quand tu respires ça, mec, t'es comme mort-né
Tu finis borné
A force de tourner en rond
Ton cerveau te fait défaut, puis fait des bonds
Et c'est vraiment pas bon quand t'en perd le contrôle
Quand pour les yeux des autres, tu joues de mieux en mieux ton rôle
Ton rôle de ""caï-ra"", juste pour ne pas
Qu'on te dise, ""Voilà tu fais plus partie de la ""mille-fa"" d'en bas""
C'est dingue mais c'est comme ça
Sache qu'ici-bas, plus qu'ailleurs, la survie est un combat
A base de coups bas, de coups de ""tom-ba""
D'esquives et de ""Paw!"" de putains de ""stom-bas""
Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Non laisse pas traîner ton fils

Laisse pas traîner ton fils
Si tu ne veux pas qu'il glisse
Qu'il te ramène du vice
Laisse pas traîner ton fils

Suprême NTM,"J't'explique que c'que j'kiffe,
C'est de fumer des spliffs.
Et puis de construire des riffs qui soient compétitifs.
Pouvoir faire de la musique tout en gardant mon éthique.
Faire du fric sans jamais tâcher l'image de ma clique
C'est fou ! mais c'est comme ça, 
J'me nourris de ça, j'ai besoin de ça,
Mon équilibre dépend de ça. 
J'suis sur le 'mic' mec, et puis j'aime ça.
J'aime quand ça fait ""Paw"", quand ça vient d'en bas, et puis quand c'est pas
Peaufiné, léché, trop sophistiqué c'est péché,
Je préfère m'approcher de la vérité sans tricher.
Sans jamais changer mon fusil d'épaule, et puis garder mon rôle, tenir la taule.

Rester en pôle position, peu confortable, mais c'est pas grave!
J'aime le challenge, porter le maillot frappé du sceau de ceux qui dérangent est
Un honneur pour moi, Comme pour tous mes complices, mes compères, mes comparses,
Fatigués de cette farce.
On ne veut plus subir et continuer à jouer les sbires.
Saches que ce à quoi j'aspire, c'est ce que les miens respirent.

I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people

A part fumer des spliffs, mon premier kiff, c'est de chiller,
Rester tranquille au sein des miens, me laisser aller à déballer des conneries,
Parler juste pour parler, refaire le monde avec notre vision décalée.
On est des fous bloqués dans des cages d'escaliers.
Pris en otage par le nombre élevé de paliers, et à la longue, mec,
J't'assure, tout ça, ça pèse.
96, je vois toujours des braises allumées 
Dans les yeux fatigués des gosses du quartier.
Passe passe le mic
Que je développe mes idées contaminées, c'est vrai j'suis miné mais déterminé
A ne jamais vraiment lâcher l'affaire, qu'est-ce que je peux faire ?
J'suis pas là pour prendre des coups, ou bien même pour me taire.
Si le FN brandit sa flamme, j'suis là pour l'éteindre, c'est clair !
Pas d'éclair de génie, juste un lyrics qui jaillit
De mon esprit, dédicacé à mon posse.

I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people
I make music for my people
'Cause that's my people

Construire est ma seule excuse au fait de prendre de l'âge.
Si j'sens pas les miens autour de moi, putain, c'est le naufrage
Assuré, c'est vrai ! 
J'me sens rassuré, qu'en présence de ceux que j'aime,
Je veux m'assurer que tout c'que j'balance soit approuvé
Même si j'ai rien à prouver, Je veux que tous mes potes puissent s'y retrouver
Je veux pouvoir les garder près de moi, les regarder 12 mois par an,
Comme l'ont fait mes parents pour moi,Parce qu'après c'est trop tard
Faut pas comprendre qu'on les aimait, une fois qu'ils sont tis-par
Ou bien, c'est qu't'as envie de pleurer, ou plutôt que tu sais pas !
Dans ce cas, j'peux rien pour toi, j'ai pas la clé du bonheur,
J'ai même jamais été à la hauteur, pour ce genre de truc,
Mais aujourd'hui j'ai peur car l'horloge a tourné",That's My People

Protect this nigga for the necklace 
I throw the death wish  the pretty slim sex shit 
The rep this remember Fox said this 
We on some next shit we are blessed this 
The scares on our backs mean we met this 
The lie for them for 25 sentence 
To keep my eyes on 'em I straight knowin' when the light shine on 'em 
Shitty drugs and drama oppposite three pretty thugs and a don momma 
Fillin' the rest, the steel in they chest 
And Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over 
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out 
It was real, for real I was fuckin' wit' mills and he was frag-ile 
We wowin', the brown stallion 
Stay stylin', on the low foulin' 
The whole Firm woulin', we lucked it 
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit 
Heard through the grade that she sucked it, Firm Sos and Esco 
Mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever and through this chedda 
We gon' stay family, till we fry though 
The fam will never split even if one of us die though 
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze til it brick-o's 
Peep the na na, sweet taboo 
The Firm tattoo on the tha tha, now tell me what crew 
Hold it down like we do da da 
Verse Two: Az the Vizuiliza 
Till the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless 
Ice neckalce, high priced dressed executives 
Peep the grammer, flim built strong stamina 
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer 
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep shit 
Remain deep in ???? thrown at ya veins jeeps 
Juiliani suite got all the kings goin' up for creek 
 Devil like biz now, who left his twirl in the streets 
 No intelligence, stritcly slow niggaz minds with ???? 
 It's evident, Feds mess up paid ya residents 
 We all for livin', heavyweight Firm division 
 Mine, I check mine ?Iaswines? is my religion 
 You know the stees, take aim, cock and squeeze 
 It's the prophecies, got the philosciphies Socrates 
 Next up 
 Verse Three: Cormega 
 Yo I believe that's me (yo Mega represent for the family) 
 Aye yo, the Feds fot me in the top ten, 'cause when my door got knocked in 
 A four four man's hoped in, my sinister mind 
 Shines like a Dilinger, Mega exhaulted Babyface crime emperor 
 Yo life is based on cultures and creeds, and feed the way 
 Be the thug nigga sess, I've seen niggaz tied up 
 Handcuffed and ????, cold crisis is live when drugs supply driver 
 The millennium drives up, rimes and my blinds ya eyes temporarily 
 Nas and Mega be heavily armed for felony, John you could never see 
 The next fat cat of NYC, It Was Written like ghetto life heirogriphics 
 Livin' since my real niggaz bailed me out of prision, a lot of scams 
 Cause the narcotics beamin', Queens had marked dollars 
 And the knowledge of thieves, my dream is the legacy 
 Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me 
 Verse Four: Nas Escobar 
 To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, ya'll need to join us 
 Firm most powerful nation of rap performers, high class generals 
 Confidence, payin' lawyers 
 Swift as Oscar Delaholia, green berett warriors 
 Fakes I keep them like the John Kennedy tape, in the new with two 
 Bustin' all in they face, I'm never worried cause your see through 
 My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth, we all eat 
 Cause we I speak truth, uneducated black youth 
 Street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stollen 
 It's a Firm thing, generally green I wrote the theme 
 On how to sell a million while ya cats are mad at ya promotion team 
 I roll with the nice as Fox, black ice pushin' whips without a license 
 Yeah, tight as five strokes, Nas got 19 wifies 
 Seven sheisty, nine of them Piceses 
 Three white meats under tight cheese, woulin' 
 Big links is heavy like bricks, used to want a pitbull 
 While feedin' them raw steak, it's core take 
 More cake, I take the time off the so-called king of the town 
 And lock it down",Affirmative Action Remix

This is what it's all about

They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

How can I be at ease when I know soon I'll lay my eyes on you,
I close my eyes imagining the moment that my dreams are gonna come true.
The way you wear your hair, the shyness underneath your smile,
the warmth of your embrace is gonna thrill me in just a little while.
I rushed right in before but right now I'm gonna take my time,
every moment we share I'm gonna savor like a vintage wine.

And when you kiss me (I'm gonna taste my lips) I won't let go,
and when you hold my hand, baby I won't say no 'cause...

Ooh baby I want ya, I can't live without ya no way,
I ain't never gonna love this way again,
no time to pretend, no, no, this time,
I'm so glad I've got another chance, mmm, to love you again,
Oh this time.

I can feel you closer to me, closer as the moment comes,
I thank God for another chance to love that very special one. (Thank you.)
Will he return my love I've held on for so many years,
I close my eyes to cry, then I heard you whisper in my ear...

I'm kissin' your lips, you're lovin' me,
this phrase keeps runnin' through my mind...

Sure Conviction,"I just got off the phone today
With a good friend of mine
She mentioned something bout her family
And having a real good time

Wouldn't it be great to see them
Wouldn't it be great to be with them
But I had my own plans for this is my life
I thought about all the words

That were shared between the two of us
For a moment I paused then I realized
If she gives into me, it would be great for my reason
Instead I could sacrifice, just a little bit of my time

If there's one thing that I've learned over the years
Without sacrifice - there isn't love
If a side of me just won't give in
And I'd rather be on my own

Than I'd never grow, I'd never know
Sacrifice - Sacrifice
I heard somebody say, to get love
You gotta give it away

And I felt something tugging at my heart that day
I knew I should pick up the phone
And tell her that I'd go along
When I did, she thanked me, now I wrote this song...

I once read about a man
Who gave of himself to the very end
He sacrificed His life for you and me
I want to learn to be like Him

And give love instead of taking it in
For it's better to give than to receive
I still believe, in sacrifice",Sacrifice

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself

They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

That grow so incredibly high.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

Making my plans someday to take the stage

Can't you see what I've become

And traces of reality come back to me
Then I see your face, somewhere in a distant place

I can feel your heartbeat, I hear your voice
And hiding in my shadow you're with me always

Survivor,"Would you still love me, if just perhaps
The roof above our heads should suddenly collapse
Would you still take me, for what I am
If I had nothin?

This heart?s an engine, it?s running lean
I'm down to skin and bone and still I'm fightin? clean
Do you share this vision, this reckless dream
Like the day we met.

If we work together we can pull this train
can't wait forever for the winds of change
Will you stand beside me like you did before
When the storm is at the window
And the wolf is at the door


These are the hungry years
Stand up and face your fears
Your faith can fight these tears
These are the hungry years*

Sometimes I watch you as you sleep
So safely unaware we might be in to deep
I hide my feelings behind these shades
Like you don't see

And if we pull together we can make this climb
With a love as tough as these desperate times
Will you stand beside me like you did before
Now the storm is at the window
And the wolf is at the door


Do you remember the feelings we had
Baby, the first time we touched
Is there a way to find it again
Girl is that asking too much - too much",Hungry Years
Survivor,"When you're alone you ask yourself
What are you searching for
Deep in the night a dream is born
One that you can't ignore
If you think you can find the passion
And you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it
Then the power is in your own hands

[Chorus]
It's the moment of truth
You're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it
Get up and prove it
Get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth
It's all on the line
This is the place
This is the time

Waited forever, it's now or it's never
Nothing can stop you now*
Once in your life you make a choice
Ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul you hear a voice
Answering to the call
Though you know that it won't be easy
It's a promise you make for love
For the people that keep believing
And the one that you're thinking of

When you're running on faith, it's the power that takes you over,
When they're hard on your heels, yet fire makes steel,

Survivor,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home

Destiny lost and found

When you keep it all inside

And hurting inside
But feeling afraid to impose
So you're an island

Cause if you're inclined
You can talk to me

But you don't have to suffer

But I'm just a word away
No no, don't suffer in silence

I'll be your shield against the wind
So, if you need a shoulder for the tears that you keep
Let em come down
Let it rain on me

Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you

But that doesn't mean they've fallen from grace
But in her landscape, their heartache is so out of place

While clutching my greed I was struck by a vision 
But for the grace of God, that could be me. 

And we gather in chambers of lofty ideals 
Still debating the giving when handed the bill 
But in the congress of kindness I hope that we can yield 
To the better angels of our nature, to the better angels of our nature. 

Angels of mercy, angels of light 
Angels of darkness, angels of might 
Angels with voices that whisper so clear 
Who do I lean to, who do I hear? 

We are building our world with a fevered emotion 
While trying to keep it from coming apart 
But as we reach for the dream can we still reach within us 
We won't have the hope if we don't have the heart. 

'Cause we've tossed in the gale of a moral decline

Your mountains of dreams, seems harder to climb
By those who have made you feel like an outcast
Cause you dare to be different, so they're drawing a line

They say you're a fool, they feed you resistance
They tell you you'll never go very far
But they'll be the same ones that stand in the distance
Alone in the shadow of your shining star

Just keep on the same road and keep on your toes
And just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
It don't matter, a rose by any name is still a rose

The kindness of strangers, it seems like a fable
But they've yet to see what I see in you
But you can make it if you are able
To believe in yourself the way I do

Just keep on the same road and keep on your toes
And just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
It don't matter, a rose by any name is still a rose

'Cause a deal is a deal in the heart of the dream
And a spade is a spade, if you know what I mean
And a rose is a rose is a rose

To deal with the scoffers it's part of the bargain
They heckle from back rows and they bark at the moon
Their flowers are fading in time's bitter garden
But yours is only beginning to bloom

So keep on that same road and keep on your toes
Just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
Just remember, a rose by any name is still a rose
A rose by any name is still a rose

Susan Ashton,"Joy at the start
Fear in the journey
Joy in the coming home
A part of the heart
Gets lost in the learning
Somewhere along the road

Along the road
Your path may wander
A pilgrim's faith may fail
Absence makes the heart grow stronger
Darkness obscures the trail

Cursing the quest
Courting disaster
Measureless nights forebode
Moments of rest
Glimpses of laughter
Are treasured along the road

Along the road
Your steps may tumble
Your thoughts may start to stray
But through it all a heart held humble
Levels and lights your way

Fear in the journey
Joy in the coming home
A part of the heart
Gets lost in the learning

Susan Ashton,"The touch of your hand will let me know
You take me in and let me go

Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secrets

Susan Ashton,"In the deep of the dark, you fell in as the heart
Of your world went down in flames
To a cauldron of pain, seeing no way out

And as you walked through the fire
Losing even desire it was like a dying swan
To look at you then but look at you now

You have found a new lease on life
A stronger step and a curious calm on your face
That you wear as if to say

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

It has worked for the good, like you heard that it could
But it was hard, so hard to believe
Standing among the ruins of a dream

But from here looking back, you can see clearly that
You can gain from things that you lose
And learn many ways by many means

You have been an inspiration to me
And all the volumes of hope your revival can speak
Will always say to me

You can rise from the ashes again
You can rise to the morning that breaks in your eyes
For what looked like your heart's demise
Has turned out to be a blessing in disguise

You can rise from the ashes again

Susan Ashton,"I've got a witness not too stable
It wouldn't get me very far
I've got one hand on the table
And one in the cookie jar
I've got sins that need eviction
From a temple that's a wreck
I've got a chain of contradiction
Hanging around my neck
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

I feel the bitter winds grow colder
They are dancing with my pride
I've got a chip on my shoulder
Bigger than a mountainside
And these claws of human nature
Hold me tight within their clasp
I'm not worthy of forgiveness
But I just had to ask
So I go down, I go down, down
I go down on my knees

(Chorus)
Feed my hunger – slake my thirst
For a spiritual rebirth
Light my darkness
Move in me
Make me more than what you see
As I go down on my knees

When I've all but killed the fire
And my soul's in desperate need
But I wallow in the mire of complacency
That's when I go down on my knees
I want to taste the fruit I'm missing
And yet I feast only on the bread
My desire's alive and kicking
But my drive is dead
So I go down on my knees

(Chorus)

You bear the weight of condemnation
Cleansing with the blood of truth
So with my humble acclamation
I want to give myself to you 
So I go down, I go down, down

Susan Ashton,"Where there is love there is a peace 
And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand 
Where there is faith there is a chance 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is love there is a peace...

All of us long for freedom, but there's only one who can break

With visible tracks, I'm finding my way
With a sorrowful heart, I honor this pain
And offer these tears to the rain

In a moment of truth at the top of the hill
I open my arms and let go of my will

And stand with my face to the wind
With the storm beating down on this sacred ground
If I stand for the grace that I've known for what I believe
Then I won't stand alone, no I won't stand alone

There's a new pair of eyes to embrace all I see
A new peace of mind and it comes quietly
There's a joy in my heart that you've given to me
And I offer this soul's melody

So I beat on my chest till my song has been sung
And I cry like a wolf at the top of my lungs

And stand with my face to the wind
With the storm beating down on this sacred ground
If I stand for the grace that I've known for what I believe
Then I won't stand alone, no I won't stand alone

When the thundering voices of doubt try to shake my faith, oh
I'll be listening from inside out and I won't be afraid to

Blow this house down

I've unlocked a box of confusion
I've lost all my reason

So I went walking through
The garden of temptation unaware
And I tasted what I wanted
Not looking for the subtle warnings
That might be hidden there
And I barreled through undaunted

Oh, I was soon seduced by a craving
That left me defenseless

With the shadow it cast

There's a comfort in death and in life

Steer us on into lands unknown we can leave this world behind
And all I know is you and me that's all we'll need to start all over again

We can runaway baby come as you are...

Turn up the radio and don't look back again
Let me put the pedal down get us outta this town
Don't be afraid to ride

Susan Ashton,"You seem like the quiet type, don't say much, well that's all right
There was a time that might have reeled me in
Yeah, but that was then I'm wiser now, at least I think so anyhow
And I ain't gonna fall for love again

I won't say that I won't miss the promise of a long slow kiss
What I miss is more than I could stand
But the price is just too hard to pay it's easier to walk away
And I ain't gonna fall for love again

Isn't it funny how I finally find you now
But you're just a little late
Yes, this promise that I made
That I don't intend to break, not for anyone

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Full of butterflies inside

Susan Boyle,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I prayed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hopes apart
And they turn your dreams to shame

And still I dream he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream, I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream

Too young to say, though I swear he knew,
And I hear him singing while he sits there in his chair,

Making noise so restlessly,
But now it's quiet and I can hear you saying,
'My little fish don't cry, my little fish don't cry.'

From up and down, and still somehow

To say ""I love you"" right out loud

They shake their heads, they tell me I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I drink much more that I ought to drink

To reach the unreachable star

No matter how far
To fight for the right

To this glorious quest
That my heart, will lie peaceful and calm

Which you sang with childish voice
Do you love the hymns they taught you
Or are songs of earth your choice?

Round the fireside long ago

When they left you here below

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for the cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in a war
For a lead role in a cage?

Susan Deangelis,"Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
These little town blues are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere

It seems like the natural thing to do
Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

And I hope that deep inside you feel it too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky lit with diamonds
When I make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you tonight

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will feel brand new
Tonight we will both discover 
How friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun 
Is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do 
Is to make love to you

Tonight I celebrate my love for you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

Susan Egan,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows 
Anything goes.",Anything Goes [From Chess]
Susan Egan,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",April Showers [From Hair]
Susan Egan,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring

It might as well be Spring","It Might as Well Be Spring, song (from film ""State Fair"") [From State F"
Susan Egan,"Out on the wiley, windy moors 
We'd roll and fall in green. 
You had a temper like my jealousy: 
Too hot, too greedy. 
How could you leave me, 
When I needed to possess you? 
I hated you. I loved you, too. 

Bad dreams in the night. 
They told me I was going to lose the fight, 
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

On the other side from you.

Falls through without you. 
I'm coming back, love. 
Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream, 
My only master. 

Too long I roam in the night. 
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right.

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Susan Egan,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go

There's only one thing you should know

If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell
Susan Johnson,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended

To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Susan Osborn,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine

'Cause love is a thing that just won't wait

Sometimes it can spite ye or just right up and bite ye
And sometimes go up right in your face
Love makes the world...

(The first time that you feel it your first thought is to steal it
And run under a rock somewhere and hide
But once that you've been smitten you can't keep it hidden

Or it just might teach you a polite)

Sometimes up and sometimes down but love makes the world go around",Love Makes the World Go Around
Susan Raye,"Happiness is something that we all need plenty of
It starts from deep inside your heart when you've someone to love
So if you're not as happy as you feel you ought to be
Find someone in this world to love and have a happy heart like me

I've got a happy heart, I feel like I could almost fly
I think if someone shot me that I wouldn't even die
Just find someone to live for and to love and then you'll see
Why I've got this happy heart inside of me

A smile is so becoming yet how many times it's true
A person wears a frown 'cause it's a habit to be blue
Sometimes it takes convincing that life can't be all that bad
Just take a look around you and you won't feel quite so sad

I've got a happy heart, I feel like I could almost fly
I think if someone shot me that I wouldn't even die
Just find someone to live for and to love and then you'll see
Why I've got this happy heart inside of me",I've Got a Happy Heart
Susan Raye,"Standing in that silent hall waitin' for that final call
Says he doesn't love me anymore
Shaking hands I pack a bag, trembling voice I call a cab
Slowly I start walking to the door

Cab arrives he blows his horn, I stumble at in the early morn
Tell him of the place I've got to go
[?] a hundred signal lights, paid the bills and a traffic fine
Gettin' through these doors that's been so slow

L.A. International Airport
Where the big jet engines roar
L.A. International Airport
I won't see him anymore

A stewardess in a miniskirt, hippie in a leather shirt
Started on the way to Naples Row
While I'm wondering where it's at I see a Paris diplomat
College kids are trying to get back home

Baggage car goes quickly by, I see my case and I start to cry
Stumble to the lounge to be alone
While I'm trying to get some rest, bite my lips and try my best
To fight the pain that's making me leave home

L.A. International Airport
Where the big jet engines roar
L.A. International Airport
I won't see him anymore

With silver wings across the sky, paper trails and wave goodbye
To those below who've got to stay at home
Wish that I had flown at night so I could take that champagne flight
Rid myself of every tear I own

Soaring high above the heaven in a 747
Fighting back the tears that curse my eyes
Captain's voice so loud and clear amplifies into my ear
Assuring me I'm flying friendly skies

Susan Shore,"About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
Never knew why, I didn't understand

Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down

Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by

And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around

Susan Udell,"Take notes young locs, I advise y'all to slow down
Glocks, K's, and eagles trying to put a murder down
Watching fools servin' found
Put your eyes on the prize, hitting switches
And getting bitches with plenty riches
And if you bang homie, do that
But when your ass gets slapped with that 25, handle that
And all you see is the glamor and gold
Don't know the other side of the game is where it's scandalous and cold
Your destiny is in your hands, you got control
Wasting time with your life until your ass is old
Trying to be bold, a hog and a pimp
Eighteen years old, HIV in the limp

Sometimes you just should let go
Get what you need and not want

I just had to have

What's crackin' gangsta

Dickie sagging how should kicking it
Bangs with me, nigga let me swang with you
Hop in this cut dog, and split this game to ya
I see them niggas that got ya tatted and called it paddering
A clutch and a glock, banging on niggas at the bus stop
Putting in work, leave you broke, cloke white shirt
Doing dirt trying to gain strikes for the turf
Loc, what up, shit I knew your brother
You used to bang with him, when you was a little motherfucker
Until they amputated both of my legs, circled the block
Caught your brother slippin' and flippin' the lead
Retaliation was swift, furious, just know this hood shit is serious
For the sake of if remembers, see your 'bout your paper
And remember, loc's success is best with revenge on these haters, nigga

Can't fuck with, what you asked for
Sometimes you just should let go

I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Murder, murder, murder

I don't wanna die
I'm trying to live, trying to survive
Niggas done got the game twisted
Yet if these bustas pump 'em up
And just start division, fool listen
Life is like a grab shot
You can either hit the jackpot
Stack a not and get a calf shot

Live you life homie
Don't get pumped up to dump and get cracked
And moms put a block on the phone
You's a hard motherfucker, but now you all alone

All alone in the streets it was on
But hit the leather for penitentery friends gone
Your on your own

Until the youth, I spit to you
They call me G dub and I spit the truth

Susan Werner,"Once in a while in my living room
I look up at your face
The man in the hand-painted photograph
I know you from someplace

What comes so hard from history
Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

Year after year in the shrinking walls
Nothing to the exchange
Wood in the smiles at the holidays
And your kiss that fit me strange

What comes so hard from history
Comes so easy to my pen

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name
Is that all that remains of us?

You gave the truth to the lie, turned your eyes to the sky
Looked away when I looked your way
There's a myth in the air, it's too late to repair
But you look at me anyway

Now where the kiss and the smile would be
The distance lies instead
Nine hundred miles of what might have been
And a world of things much better left unsaid

And I keep signing your name
While the world stays the same around you
I keep signing your name

Willing to believe
The story of the big strong man

Follows his own dreams
The man who would be King some day
But it isn't all it seems
With empty bottles standing in the way

And you say
Hang on, just a little bit longer
You say, hold on, just a little bit more
But I, I know now what I didn't before
And I will not love you through the glass

You say, hang on, just a little bit longer
You say, hold on, just a little bit more
But I, I know now what I didn't before
And I will not love you through the glass

I will not love you
I will not love you through it

Susan Werner,"Sonoma County on a Sunday
Not a cloud in the California sky
Cement Buddha in the backyard
Unperturbed by the ants crawlin' up his thigh

T.J. sittin' in a deck chair
Smiles her easy smile from ear to ear
Maura standin' in the doorway

Stretch yourself back underneath the sun
Close your eyes and let the daydreams
Dance across your forehead one by one

Feel them warm your frozen bones
Listen as the music plays
And the serotonin flows in

Goodbye kisses 'round sundown
Gas and coffee by the Interstate
Due in Vancouver in the mornin'
Safe to say you're gonna be just a little late

Seattle is only sailboats in the rain
So drag your feet in California

Susana Baca,"This afternoon it's raining like never before,
And I no longer feel like living, my love

This afternoon is sweet. 
Why shouldn't it be?
It is dressed in grace and pain. 
It is dressed as woman
This afternoon in Lima it's raining. And I remember
The cruel caverns of my ingratitude
A block of ice above your poppy flower
Stronger than your ""don't be like that!""

My violent black blooms
And the savage stone, and frozen distances.
And your silent dignity
Will put an end with burning oils

That's why this afternoon, I go
With this owl, with this heart

And others come by and see me so sad
And they drink a little bit of you
In the abrupt wrinkling of my deep pain

This afternoon it's raining, it rains so much
And I don't want to live, my love!

Esta tarde llueve, como nunca; why no
Tengo ganas de vivir, corazón.
Esta tarde es dulce. Por qué no ha de ser?
Viste gracia why pena; viste de mujer.
Esta tarde en Lima llueve. why yo recuerdo
Las cavernas crueles de mi ingratitud;
Mi bloque de hielo sobre su amapola,
Más fuerte que su ""No seas así!""
Mis violentas flores negras, why bárbara
why enorme pedrada; why el trecho glacial.
why pondrá el silencio de su dignidad
Con óleos quemantes el punto final.
Por eso esta tarde, como nunca, voy
Con este búho, con este corazón.
why otras pasan; why viéndome tan triste;
Toman un poquito de ti
En la abrupta arruga de mi hondo dolor
Esta tarde llueve, llueve mucho. ¡Y no

De una linda mujer
En las noches de Octubre 
Corazón, que has sabido sufrir 
Y has sabido querer 
Desafiando el dolor

Tan solo al pensar 
Que tu amor se descubre 

El castigo de ayer
Que me diste tan cruel 
Parece que murió

No perturbes jamás 
la risueña ilusión 
de mis sueños dorados 

Si me voy nunca pienses jamás

De estar lejos de ti

I was puttin' on make-up
Tryin' to feel pretty
Looked around my tidy little home
Oh, I was tired of bein' alone.

I had an eight o'clock date with a man I never met
I hate to be late
So, I headed east on Sunset
Thinkin' anything is better
Than being alone.

Now, I'm lookin' in the eyes of my man

Did you see him smile?
Did you see him smile?
Did you see him smile?

There was fog in the road, it was like I was drivin' blind
The faces I've known kept
Runnin' around in my mind
I was right to keep lookin', I was right to look ahead
You never know what you might find.

I was feeling so old and naive at the very same time
Had no idea
If I could even talk to a guy
If I could run, if I could leave, if I could hide
You know I would but there he was and it was time.

Now, I'm lookin' in the eyes of my baby
Now, I'm lookin' in the eyes of my man

I can, somehow, rise above it
Yeah man, when I got that little girl standing right by my side,
You know, I can tell the whole wide world, just shove it

Yeah, she looks so right, shes all I need tonight

It just seems so useless to have to work so hard,
And nothin' ever really seem to come from it

Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears

Its late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I shouldn't have tried any more

You lured me away from home just to save me from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

Morning sun when its in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
Laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore

You lured me away from home, just to save me from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
I was blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Susanna Hoffs,"Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, 
Heads all empty and I don't care,
Saw my baby down by the river, 
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air.

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow, 
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature, 
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.

She's got everything delightful, 
She's got everything I need,
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double, 
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet, 
She can wade in a drop of dew,
She don't come and I don't follow, 
Waits backstage while I sing to you.

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm, 
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive.
She's a summer love for spring, fall and winter. 
She can make happy any man alive.

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell, 
Caught up in sunlight, come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine, 
Come on honey, come along with me.

She's got everything delightful, 
She's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight,
Lazing in the sunshine yes indeed.

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, 
When the moon is half way down,
Sometimes when the night is dying, 
I take me out and I wander around, I wander 'round.

Sunshine, daydream, walking in the tall trees, 
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely,
Ride our singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine, daydream. 
Sunshine, daydream. 
Walking in the sunshine",Sugar Magnolia
Susanna Hoffs,"You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped below one eye
Your scarf it was apricot
You had one eye on the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte
And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner, and

[Chorus]
You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you
You're so vain, I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? don't you?

You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive
Well you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

[Chorus]

I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and
Well I hear you went up to Saratoga and your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Lear Jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

How the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself.
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else.
Life in the hive puckered up my night,
The kiss of death, the embrace of life.
There I stand neath the Marquee Moon just waiting,
Hesitating
I ain't waiting
I spoke to a man
Down at the tracks.
I asked him
How he don't go mad.
He said 'Look here junior, don't you be so happy.
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad.'

Pulled up to me

And I won't mind the people when they stare 
Paint a different color on your front door 
And tomorrow we will still be there

It sails the rivers and it sails the tide 
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to 
Some can't get a single thing to work inside

And I won't mind the people when they stare 
Paint a different color on your front door 
And tomorrow we will still be there

And I can see the sorrow in your eyes 
I hope you know a lot more than you're believing

But the heartache's in me till this day

[Chorus]
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times
When we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I can't be happy without you around

So all alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there is only one thing that I can say

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No, not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through

But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?

Did you stand by me
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

Thought you'd realize, that I would know, I would show
The special love I have for you, my Baby Blue

How can I show, you, show me a way

Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard

Susannah McCorkle,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

Of rainbows on a wave,

Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again

Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try

And you see him in non-fiction V-why
He looks up from world war two
And then you catch him, catch him, catch him in his eye

So you quickly turn away a wishful stare
And take a sudden interest in your shoes
If you only had the courage but you don't
And he turns and leaves and you both lose

And you think about the people that you never get to love
It's not as if you even had the chance
So many worth a second life but rarely do you get a second glance
Until fate cuts in on your dance

And you'll see him on a train that you just missed
At a bus stop where your bus will never stop
Or in a passing Buick when you've been pulled over by a traffic cop

Or you'll share an elevator, just you two
And rise in solemn silence to your floor
Like the fool you are, you get off
And he leaves your life behind a closing door

And you think about the people that you never get to love
That poem you intended to begin
The saddest that anyone has ever said are Lord what might have been?
But no one ever said you get to win

Still you'll never going to miss what you don't know
And you don't know who you'll meet at half past three

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Warms an old implacable heart such as mine

Someone's gotta be kissed

From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore

Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live

Memories always start 'round midnight

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

Susanne Sundfør,"Purple pavements
Crooked fingers knocking on windows without souls
Bodies are swinging from rooftops and poles
Howling through hollows
Restless nights in one night cheap hotels
Oh, I'm only drifting to always come back

And I search for something
Oh, whatever I don't really care
Driving with their lights off they can be anywhere
Rolling down their windows
Open car with open mouths
Golden teeth and golden cards

You cover your eyes, you cover your mouth, you cover your ears
Still you follow my trail
I'll do it all, I'll do whatever you say, God has left me anyway

Lava laden pavements
Stars with stains and the heaven and afterglow
Beneath the ashes our echoes are buried alive
They are howling through hollows
Once we've shared their temple of halls
Now our heads are hung up on walls

We are ruins within ruins
On every corner a gladiator is begging for another century
When no one cut your tongue to know nothing and to know it all
To be both the animal and god

You cover your eyes, you cover your mouth, you cover your ears
Still you follow our trail
We'll do it all, we'll do whatever you say, God has left us anyway
You cover your eyes, you cover your mouth, you cover your ears

Susaye Greene,"When your secrets unfold, your heart aches
And when your secrets untold, your heart breaks
And when the truth can be told, then love takes
A different turn for you and I

You should have been here with me
Just to walk and hold my hand
You could have been here with me
Walking footprints in the sand

You would have been home last night
Just to softly call my name
Things would never be the same

When your secrets unfold, your heart aches
And when your secrets untold, your heart breaks
And when the truth can be told, then love takes
A different turn for you and I

You should have been here with me
Catching rainbows in the sky
You could have been here with me
Climbing every mountain high

You would have come home last night
Just to watch the sun come up
And our love would never be enough

If you and I could erase time
Things would be better, better
If it could be just you and me
Love would be sweeter as the days go by
Into the realm where love is held
We've got to go on, let secrets go

When the truth can be told, then love takes
A different turn for you and I

When the truth can be told

You should have been here with me
Just to walk and hold my hand
I needed you here with me
Walking footprints in the sand

You would have been home last night
Where were you?

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

End it all and let her go to some better man;

There's a blue, there's a blue sky on my left and a pink sky on my right
And I'm driving down the 92 where the bridge looks like it touches the sky
And I'm thinking to myself
Where did all the time go
And why can't I remember
What it was like when I was young

Of some suburban shopping mall
And I'm dressed in my work uniform making friends with all
The vacant cars
And I'm thinking to myself
I gotta make a big decision today and I hope I choose a better tomorrow
Rather than a better yesterday

And you grow a little older
Nothing stays the same
The past becomes the future

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Sutton Foster,"Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plain
And the waving wheat can sure smell sweet
When the wind comes right behind the rain

Oklahoma every night my honey lamb and I
Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk
Making lazy circles in the sky

We know we belong to the land and the land we belong to is grand
And when we say ah yippee yo ah yea
We're only saying you're doin' fine Oklahoma

Sutton Foster,"Once upon a time
A boy with moonlight in his eyes
Put his hand in mine 
And said he loved me so
That was once upon a time 
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars 
And waiting for the dawn
That was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone
How the breeze ruffled through his hair
How we always laughed as though
Tomorrow wasn't there
We were young
And didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again.",Once Upon a Time
Sutton Foster,"Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you a day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd wish for you for sunshine all the while

Sutton Foster,"When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me

So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get far away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof that's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof, up on the roof

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling you can share it all with me

I keep telling you right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
So if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof, up on the roof",Up on the Roof

One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Bill and coo when they love?

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Suzanne Cloud,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.

And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left

The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land

I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me

Scattering in the park
In the tickling
And the trembling
Of freeze tag

And you can be Dean

You stand
With your hand
In your pocket
And lean against the wall
You will be Bogart
And I will be

And we can only say yes now
To the sky, to the street, to the night

Slow fade now to black

Of chivalry

Do you see
where I've been hiding
In this hide-and-seek?

To quench a thirst

She spoke to me once
At a party, I think
And I thought at the time
That she had had too much to drink, because she
Said to me, 'There's a backbone gone
And I've got to get it back
Before going on'

And your neighborhood girl
Seems to have resigned
She was looking out at people
From the back of her mind
And before she went off
She spoke to me again
She came up and said

And there's a razor's edge
That I have lost somewhere
And I would like it back
So if you've seen it anywhere

Suzanne Vega,"The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
The queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside.

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why.""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down.

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

Well the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan.

And she said, ""I have swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground.

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again.

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange.""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside.

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on.",The Queen and the Soldier
Suzanne Vega,"If I had met you on some journey
Where would we be now
If we had met some eastbound train
Through some black sleeping town

Would you have worn your silken robes
All made of royal blue?
Would I have dressed in smoke and fire
For you to see through?

If we had met in a darkened room
Where people do not stay
But shadows touch and pass right through
And never see the day

Would you have taken me upstairs
And turned the lamplight low?
Would I have shown my secret self
And disappeared like the snow?

Or I could have played your wife
I could have played your mistress
Running danger down through you life

I could have played your lady fair

I could have been your woman of the road
As long as you did not come back home to me

And everything stays in place
Instead we meet on the open sidewalk
And it's well I know your face

I wonder what might have been here

Suzanne Vega,"My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island 
And I waken to the dawn
A long time ago
I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning
And I brought him into me
Now today
Come morning light
He sails away
After one last night
I let him go.

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden
Is the sweetness there that grows
My hair it blows long
As I sing into the wind
My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island
I tell of nights
Where I could taste the salt on his skin

Salt of the waves
And of tears
And though he,pulled away
I kept him here for years
I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away
To be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart

And my song in the wind
The sand will sting my feet
And the sky will burn
It's a lonely time ahead
I do not ask him to return
I let him go

With the dimples and the curls
By the pretty and the mischievous
By the timid and the blessed
By the blowing skirts of ladies
Who promise to gather you to their breast

Oh, hold me like a baby

You have hands of raining water
And that earring in your ear
The wisdom on your face
Denies the number of your years
With the fingers of the potter
And the laughing tale of the fool
The arranger of disorder
With your strange and simple rules
Yes now I've met me another spinner
Of strange and gauzy threads
With a long and slender body
And a bump upon the head

Oh, hold me like a baby

With a long and slender body
And the sweetest softest hands
And we'll blow away forever soon
And go on to different lands
And please do not ever look for me

And you will hear yourself in song

Holding one thing
A small white wooden horse
I'd been holding inside

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

And in the night the walls disappeared
In the day they returned
'I want to be a rider like my father'
Were the only words I could say

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

Alive
And I fell under
A moving piece of sun
Freedom

I came out of the darkness
Holding one thing
I know I have this power
I'm afraid I may be killed

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive
What was wood became alive

And when I'm dead
If you could tell them this
That what was wood became alive

Suzanne Vega,"Somewhere in a room
With a poster on a wall
Of a man with his hand
In a fist

Is a woman who's drinking
And her dress is so tight
You can see every breath
That she takes

Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair

The man on the wall
Is his symbol of freedom
It means he has brothers
Who believe as he does

She is moved by
The thing that she sees in his face
When he talks of
The cause

Every sigh, every sway
You can hear everything that they say
Something's begun like a war
Or a family or a friendship
Or a fast love affair

She leans against him
Her dress is so red
They talk of the salt
And the truth and the bread

The night goes along
The fan goes around
In the room off the street
At the end of the town

This long of a winter

Croak and sigh

Somewhere deep within

On Sunday
No traffic
On the avenue
The light is pale and thin
Like you
No sound, down
In this part of town
Except for the boy in the belfry

Down from the top of the tower
Like a hunchback in heaven
He's ringing the bells in the church
For the last half an hour

Or someone that he knows he can't
Have now and if he isn't
I certainly am

Homesick for a clock

In somebody's arms

In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""

Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began

one thing I know
this pain will go


step through all that's left to feel
I wait to meet my love made real


don't move don't touch 
don't talk so much


strip and find the place to kneel
I wait to meet my love made real


one thing I know 

this day will go 

don't touch don't talk crawl the wall
she's the ticket to the future don't listen down the hall
you can say your prayer to the head of this bed
when it begins at your knees and goes right to your head


birth-day 

strap me down from wrist to heel
I wait to meet my love made real


one thing I know
this day will go


shake all over like an old sick dog
there's a needle here needle there tremble in the fog
it's a tight squeeze vice grip ice and fire
she's a hot little treasure and the wave goes higher

I only turned to see
What hand had set this inner field alight
Against the flame I see
The outline of a man against a night

Take back your sympathy
I do not need to drink that bitter stuff
I'd rather break the thread
That bound us close, and say we called a bluff

A casual match
In a very dry field
What could be
The season's yield?

My eyes have gone to coal
It's nothing I would be concerned about
Observe the moment
When the heat of love becomes the chill of doubt

In a very dry field
Fire and ash
Is the season's yield

We look for a sign
But it is not revealed

Season's yield",Casual Match

And that was all,
A picture of a boy
And a number you could call,
Two eyes in the shade
A mouth so sad and small,
It's strange the way a shadow
Can fall across the wall, 
And make the difference

Ah... 

He's just a poster, but
He's everywhere,
A face under a street lamp
Ripped and hanging in the air,
Turn the corner
And he's still there,
Watching all the people
Who are passing unaware,
Is there a judgment
In what he sees?
Ah... 

On a day
As cold
And gray
As today...

The sign says ""Head shots""
It's all I see,
A boy becomes a picture
Of guilt and sympathy,
And so I think of you 
In memory
Of the days we were together,
And I knew that you loved me
That was the difference
In what we see,
But that's history...
Ah...",Headshots
Suzanne Vega,"The ceiling had a painting on it
In our room in France
So we were living underneath 
Some angels in a dance

My husband was not feeling well
And so we went to bed
He woke up complaining
Of an aching in his head

He said a hundred people
Had come through our room that night
That one by one the old and young
Asked if he was all right

One by one the old and young
Lined up to touch his hand
He spent the night explaining
They had come to the wrong man

The concierge was less than helpful
When we asked her the next day
With coffee and a magazine
We went to the desk to pay

""What happened in that room?"" he asked
""A death or something strange?""
She smiled at him politely
And returned to him his change

Well, what I'd like to know
And this will be a mystery,
Is with all the people in that room
Why none appeared to me?

When we sleep so close together that
Our hair becomes entwined
I must have missed that moment

Her slender little fingers

The threads of recent slumbers

Do you know where friendship ends
And passion does begin?
It's between the binding of
Her stockings and her skin.
(Oh yeah) 

She stayed up so late I thought
She'd ask me to go dance
But something in the way she laughed
Told me I had no chance 

The fiction in her family
Was that she was never nice
I'd say she was very
I just did not see the price

And passion does begin?
When the gin and tonic
Makes the room begin to spin.

But it will never flower

In this witching hour

To be easily bruised

When she's so easily amused?

Pressed the branches to your chest
Promised luck and all the rest
Ran their fingers through your hair

Like an accident of fate
In the window there behind your door
How I wanted to break in
To that room beneath your skin

With the statues in the courtyard
Whose heads and hands were taken in the burden of the sun

I was going up the hillside and the journey just begun

And dance in the hall
With the music up loud
Against the light on the wall

We were in costume
And this was a game

She'd put on her skirt
Of layers of chiffon
The top of the umbrella had come off
So I put that on

We'd dance together then
An awkward ballet
She was 20 years older than I was
But still we did play

She was 20 years older than me
And many times my size
But it's her little feet I remember
And the look in her eyes

Once when I saw her
She made me a doll
Of ribbon and paper and ink
And lace, I recall

I danced beside her

I must have left all those feelings inside
Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Or did I even figure at all?
All of this happened before she was born
Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall

Of your home and your hearth and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

Suzanne Vega,"The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
He said, ""I am not fighting for you any more""
And the queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why?""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

Oh the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

She said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside and often I've bled""
And he laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""And tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone and you are never revealed?
But I won't march again upon your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see

And the sun, it was gold though the sky it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
And she took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
The battle continued on

By her long cool stare and her silence

Watched it grow, watched it grow
Watched it as it struggled so

I cut the twine

I watched it drink
And watched it feed
And grow beyond

By the brass candlestick near your red velvet coat

I must have left all those feelings inside
'Cause that year I had no courage to show

Was I the name you could never pronounce?
Or did I even figure at all?

Did I shadow her young pencil marks on the wall

Of your home and your hearth and your family and wife
Who'd been darkened so often before

And slowly she let him inside

He said, ""I've watched your palace up here on the hill
And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will
Only first I am asking you why""

Down in the long narrow hall he was led
Into her rooms with her tapestries red
And she never once took the crown from her head
She asked him there to sit down

He said, ""I see you now, and you are so very young
But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun
And now will you tell me why?""

The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
She said, ""You won't understand, and you may as well not try""
But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
But she closed herself up like a fan

And she said, ""I've swallowed a secret burning thread
It cuts me inside, and often I've bled""
He laid his hand then on top of her head
And he bowed her down to the ground

""Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel
As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed
But I won't march again on your battlefield""
And he took her to the window to see.

And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray
And she wanted more than she ever could say
But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away
And would not look at his face again

And he said, ""I want to live as an honest man
To get all I deserve and to give all I can
And to love a young woman who I don't understand
Your highness, your ways are very strange""

But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached
She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
She would only be a moment inside

Out in the distance her order was heard
And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word
And while the Queen went on strangely in the solitude she preferred

Suzanne Vega,"Last year's troubles are so old fashioned
The robber on the highway the pirate on the seas
Maybe it's the clothing that's so entertaining
The earrings and swashbuckling blouses that please

But nobody these days has that kind of chin
Over there the petticoats of ladies of virtue
You can hardly tell them from the petticoats of sin

Look at all the waifs of Dickensian England
Why is it their suffering is more picturesque?
Must be cause their rags are so very Victorian

They gleam with a luster they don't have today

It's not the man, but it's the marriage that was drowned
So I walk the walk, and wait with watchful eye out to the sky,
Looking for a kind of vessel I have never found.

Though I saw it splinter, I keep looking out to sea.
Like a dog with little sense, I keep returning,
To the very area where I did see the thing go down,
As if there's something at the site I should be learning.

That line is the horizon.
We watch the wind and set the sail,
But save ourselves when all omens
Point to fail.

If I tell the truth then I would have to tell you this;
Though I grieve (and I believe I feel it truly),
I knew that ship was empty by the time it hit the rocks,
Cause we could not hold on when fate became unruly.

So consider me a widow, boys, and I have told you why
Does the weather say a better day is nearing?
I'll set my house in order now and wait upon the Will,
Cause it's clear that I need better skill in steering.

That line is the horizon.
We watch the wind and set the sail,

You can do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain.”

As the demons flew and the shadows grew
This song went around her brain
“You can do what you like but never uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain.”

Macklemore went to the thrift shop
Looking to pop some tags
Found an ancient oil lamp
Hidden among the rags
So he picked it up and he rubbed it down
Thought he’d gone insane

Cause a genie flew out, singing “Never uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain”
Genie flew out, singing “Never uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain”

He picked it up and he rubbed it down
Thought he’d gone insane
Cause the genie flew out singing “Never uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain.”
But sometimes though you have to
Let out what you’re keeping inside
If you keep it all in, your head will spin
And your mouth is all tongue tied

You’ve got to find the way to say what you say
And get it down on the page
Or the stage
It’s the cage for that tiger rage that you can’t contain

Yes the page and the stage is the cage for that tiger rage
That you can’t contain, for real
The page and the stage is the cage
For that tiger rage, what it is that you feel
So, do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain
Do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain

Cause the page and the stage is the cage
For that tiger rage that’ll cause you pain
Do what you like but you better uncork
Uncork what you can’t contain",Don't Uncork What You Can't Contain
Suzanne Vega,"There is a road
Beyond this one
It’s called the path
We don’t yet take

I can feel how it longs
To be entered upon
It calls to me with a cry
And an ache

As we go along this one
And we live the way we do
Love pulls us on to that
Distant horizon so true

I knew a man
He lived in jail
And his tale
Is often told

He dreamed of that line that he
Called the divine
And when he was free
He led his country

Yes he taught the way of love
And he lived in that way too
Love pulled him on to that
Distant horizon so true

There is a road beyond this one
Called the path we don’t yet take
I can feel how it longs to be entered upon
It calls to me with a cry and an ache

As we go along this one
And we live the way we do
Love pulls us on to that distant horizon
Love pulled him on to that perfect horizon
Love pulls us on to that distant horizon
So true",Horizon (There Is a Road)

Now maybe we've gone far enough
Are you sure you know just what where heading for

Here we stand like a couple of fools and the race is on
Hand in hand as we break the rules and the race is on
What's the cost to the one who lost when the race goes wrong
You may say why begin when we both can't win, but the race goes on

She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cos she's in love with you

So if you see her all alone one night walk up to her discreetly, ask her why
And if she replies with words that don't make sense it may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding just because you think you could
Treat her right, treat her good, take her home and make her feel the way she should

She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around

She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know, but she's in love with you

So if you happen to be out one night and someone asks you where you're gonna go
Just remember she's not like the other girls she may not want them all to know
Though she may need a little time she never wants to stand in line the way they would
So treat her nice, treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

'Cos she's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Cos she's in love with you
She's in love with you, that's all she wants to do
She'll never let you go, she may not let you know, but she's in love with you

So take her home and hold her close, touch her where she feels it most, but be true
And when she's making love to you, she'll do what you want her to
Treat her good, treat her like you know you should
You may never find another girl like her

Suzi Quatro,"You broke my heart when you came home with someone else's lipstick on
You shut the door and climb the stair, your attitude is you could care about me
When you pull the covers back and climb into the sack, bet you could do without me
It's me the fool who's always there, and you the fool who never cares

And every time you do it, you could care less if it were really her or me
You know you do it really well, just bad enough for me to tell

So why don't you give me a break, I've had as much as I could take, now we should

Suzi Quatro,"In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on HighWay 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected
And steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Wendy let me in I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wraps your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Will you walk with me out on the wire
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if your love is wild
Girl I want to know if love is real
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach on a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
The highway's jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight

Together Wendy we can live with the sadness

Now your secrets been safe with me
You've been keep it to yourself for too long
And the world is still waiting to see, all the beautiful crazy things you've become
And you're a little bit more then they ever did see
Now you're bigger than life and a little bit free
You know what you want when you get what you need
That's something you said to me

You want to deny all of the lights
But don't try to hide them from me
You want to fight but you left behind
But I need to make you see
You better run to me

I'm like a time bomb tickin' away
Too much obsession is better than nothin'

I built the walls then you break them down
I try but I can't come to my senses
You really know how to play me

Cause you shake me up when you touch my skin
Leave your name on me like a fingerprint
Cause I need you, I breath you like oxygen
You're saturated in my skin

You're like tattoo I try to cover
You're like an itch that won't go away
You're the mistake I keep running back to
Don't want to jump but you made me

Why do I feel worthless when no one's told me in a while'

'Cause I would give anything to have some piece of mind
Because there ain't no price that is too high for me

So in love
There's is only so much
Can't be with you
Can't live without you

And you got no one to rely on
But that can change 'cause there ain't no rules to this game
And even if there were I would break them just the same

There's only so much
Can't be with you
Can't live without you

There's only so much

Suzie McNeil,"I know how it feels to be driving down the wrong side
Running red lights inside of me
The signs all scream don't go that way

There is only so far you can go in your head
You turned me around with the things that you said

'Cause you take me just where I need to go
Somewhere you can't go alone
Baby, I couldn't see
I was looking too low, looking too low
You can't see if your head is hanging down
What's right here waiting to be found
Baby I couldn't see you I was looking too low, looking too low

Been living my life with a weight on my shoulder
Growing older but not wiser
Weeds are showin' through the cracks in my lonely heart
There is only so far you can go in your head
Your life hits a wall when your soul isn't fed

If you didn't pushed me, if you hadn't cared
How would I have ever dared'

Maybe I'm crazy too,
But I'll always love you...

I melt into a dream.

It hurts me now and then
But I'd do it all again,
With no regrets.

Maybe I am blue,
Maybe I'm crazy too,

The moon was as bright as a reading light
For a letter from an old friend back home

she asked me
Why does he ride for his money?
Why does he rope for short pay?
he ain't gettin' nowhere
And he's losin' his share
Oh, he must've gone crazy out there

They married and have a good life
Oh, you sure missed the track when you never came back
She made the perfect professional's wife

Never seen a hawk on the wing
Never seen the spring at the Great Divide

And ridden off into the sunset
This hip shooting cowboy steps up and says
""Reach for the sky""

I could tell he was fast, I could tell he was smart
I could tell he was looking for trouble
He was fixing to take his best shot
At my bullet proof heart

I'm under the gun, I'm under attack
The sights are lined up, the hammer is back
I'm under the gun and it's going down to the wire

I'm under the gun, he's aiming to win
He's thinking he might get under my skin
If he hits me with his fire, I'm under the gun

Just when I thought I had gotten away
With all of the hearts I had stolen
He looks in my eyes and says
""Crimes of the heart do not pay""

It was too late to talk, it was too late to run
It was too late to hold up this showdown
It was already all said and done
I was under the gun

I'm under the gun, I'm under attack
The sights are lined up, the hammer is back
I'm under the gun and it's going down to the wire

I'm under the gun, he's aiming to win
He's thinking he might get under my skin
If he hits me with his fire, oh, I'm under the gun

Happiness like it was
Buried treasure
Somewhere behind a secret door
Surely there were riches
Beyond measure
I would take my sanity to task
Walk across broken glass to find it
And no mountain top was left unclimbed
Before I ever took the time to look
Inside me

These dreams of mine
These precious years
Oh how they shine
Like diamonds and tears

The slow grace of time
The joy and the fears
Oh how they shine
Like diamonds and tears

Oh sure there was love
And of course I thought he'd be my salvation
And in a way I guess he was
There's always room for higher education

But I keep comin' back to you

And it's rough and it's tough and it's harder

But I love you so much that in spite of the struggle
I keep comin' back to you

This room that we've shared so long
We've studied the map of cracks in the ceiling
Talking till the break of dawn

But I love you so much that in spite of the struggle
I keep comin' back to you

",I Keep Comin' Back to You
Suzy Bogguss,"In my heart there always crept a jealousy that never slept
It lived on calls that never came, and whispers of another's name
But your love is a light that shines so honestly
And now because of your true colors I can see

No green eyes, no blue nights
No jealous heart and no little white lies
You showed me what love looks like
I had the colors all wrong, now they're right
No green eyes, no blue nights

Your arms laid to rest the fear, and let suspicion disappear
There are no ghosts of lovers past, just our love in the hourglass
And what you give me is so constant and so surely mine
That I can trust it's unconditional this time

No green eyes, no blue nights
No jealous heart and no little white lies
You showed me what love looks like
I had the colors all wrong, now they're right
No green eyes, no blue nights
You showed me what love looks like
No green eyes, no blue nights, no green eyes",No Green Eyes
Suzy Bogguss,"Suns comes creepin'
Chasin' away
Shadows of last night
You're still sleeping,I'm facing 
The day
Things look so different in 
The light

Someday you're gonna love me
I'll see it in your eyes
When I held you in the darkness
I could believe those lies
Now the sun is up it's morning
And you don't love me still
It finally dawned on me,you
Never will

Look at you,how real it all
Seems
I still feel your touch
But I'm through believin'
This dream
I guess I'm finally wakin' up

Hold on you said hold on
But there's no use in crying when
It's done
Another day has just begun

Now the sun is up,it's morning
And you don't love me still
It finally dawned on me,you
Never will",You Never Will
Suzy Bogguss,"I don't know why we act like that
You hurt me, I only hurt you back
I can't believe how carelessly we say those things
That put our love in danger

You wouldn't say that to a stranger we hurt the ones we love
When we say those words in anger, do we ever make it up
We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger

Last night there was over in the air
Today it's gone just like it was never there
And I don't know where those hateful words come from
It goes against our nature

You wouldn't say that to a stranger we hurt the ones we love
When we say those words in anger, do we ever make it up
We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger

Let's pretend that we just met
And we said nothing we regret

We say what we don't mean and then we say we're sorry later
But you wouldn't say that to a stranger",You Wouldn't Say That to a Stranger
Suzy Bogguss,"I didn't mean to get this close
It feels too right
And I'll think straighter 
Tomorrow
If I don't hold you tonight
I realize it's time for me to go
But it seems only fair to let 
You know

Of all the things I've wanted to
Do and never done
You'd be the one
And if you want to know how
Close I'd ever come
You'd be the one

Looking at it honestly
I guess I knew
I opened up this door
But I can't let you walk through
I have too much to lose if I fall
But if it means anything at all

I wear this ring to tell the world 
I love one man
But you and I almost got out
Of hand",You'd Be the One
Suzy Bogguss,"I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
But somehow it doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap, so we could talk all night long
We may never figure out just where our love went wrong

[Chorus]
I don't want to be standin' here
And I don't want to be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again

[Chorus]

Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

Hat crown you're wearin'
Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground
You can have this ticket
For that lonely plane that's flyin' out

[Chorus]",Outbound Plane
Suzy Bogguss,"There's a young man that I know whose age is twenty-one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service, he's lookin' for his fun
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

My parents can not stand him 'cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the roughest road I know
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

But when he comes to call, my pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old Blue Northern, blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon

When he comes to call, my pa ain't got a word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old blue northern, blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo as much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon
Someday soon, goin' with him",Someday Soon
Suzy Bogguss,"Said I wouldn't but I here I am
About to follow my heart off these cliffs again
Leave good sense and caution on the ledge behind me
I just want to feel that rushing wind
Stop all this double guessing
After all only heaven knows
If there's a curse or blessing
Waitin' for me somewhere below

And all I gotta do is fall
Close my eyes and lean
Love will find the wings
I don't have to understand
Where it's going to lead
How I'm going to land
If this love will fly at all
All I've gotta do is fall

I feel your heart beating a thousand miles a minute
The points of no return are flying past
This ain't no game we're playing
Let's just out and say it
Sometimes you've gotta call the kettle black
I ain't overanalyzing
Dehumanizing this emotional thing
The hard parts realizing
I've made it harder than it has to be

All I gotta do is fall
Close my eyes and lean
Love will find the wings
I don't have to understand
Where it's going to lead
How I'm going to land
If this love will fly at all
All I've gotta do is fall

The hard part is realizing
I've made it harder than it has to be
When.. all I gotta do is fall
Close my eyes and lean
Love will find the wings
I don't have to understand
Where it's going to lead
How I'm going to land
If this love will fly at all
All I've is gotta do is fall
All I've got to do
All I've got to do is fall",Fall
