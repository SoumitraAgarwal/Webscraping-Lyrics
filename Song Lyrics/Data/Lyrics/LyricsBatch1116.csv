Richard Lugo,"Ever since the night starts the creeping
then something inside just takes over me
and i can't stop thinkin about it
i know i can live without it
How can I forget the way she approached me
I don't know where so graceful and slowly
Totally controlling me with every groove

Now I just gotta be everywhere that she
it's because I long for that special feeling
That touched me oh so deep
moves all the way through me baby
I don't think that i can ever get enough
enough of her love
so come

Chorus 

come with me to a place I know
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive
Where they dance all night till the morning light
Senorita, Senorita

Never again will I feel so lonely
she's in my heart i'm never alone
she talks to me when i am sad and
good times are as close as by
this sweet melody that i've never heard
so many i know are in love with her
but i don't care she was placed here
for everyone

Now I just gotta be everywhere that she is
it's because I long for that special feeling
That touched me oh so deep
moves all the way through me baby
I don't think that i can ever get enough
enough of her love
so come

Chorus 

come with me to a place I know (come on baby)
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go (ooh!)
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live (always live!)
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive (Ocean Drive)
Where they dance all night till the morning light
Senorita, Senorita

come with me to a place I know (come on baby)
Ooh your gonna love where we're gonna go (come on baby)
We can take a walk down the ocean shore
Senorita, Senorita
Where the music and the people are always live (people are solive)
Everybody wanna ride down Ocean Drive (on Ocean Drive)
Where they dance all night till the morning light

Richard Madigan,"You need a man to get lost in 
With a heart big enough to roam 
No more fences for you to look through 
With your heart caught in a strangle hold 
I've got a love full of wide open spaces 

I've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love

When two hearts make a stand together
On the solid rock of trust
They could be a million miles from each other
And still be side by side in love
I want to love you like that forever

I've got a big love
Wild and free
Room to grow
As big as your dreams
Deep as a river in a raging flood
As endless as the stars above
I've got a big love

You never dreamed you could have all you ever wanted
Darlin' you can have it all with me

Richard Maltby,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

You used to do

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you

Richard Maltby,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear

Richard Maltby,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere

Richard Maltby,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In
Richard Maltby,"There's been a change in me!
I have a lovely disposition
That's very strange in me
And life's as sweet as it can be
I've lots of courage and ambition
From every care my mind is free
So I repeat, with your permission
There's been a change in me!
 
Have you heard I married an angel
I'm sure that the change'll be awf'lly good for me
Have you heard an angel I married
To heaven she's carried this fellow with a kiss
She is sweet and gentle, so it isn't strange
When I'm sentimental, she loves me like an angel
Now you've heard, I married an angel
This beautiful change'll be awf'lly good for me

Richard Maltby,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Richard Maltby,"The night is young and you're so beautiful,
Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.
The moon is high and you're so glamorous,
And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?
The night is young and I'm in love with you.",The Night Is Young and You're So Beautiful
Richard Maltby,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?

Richard Maltby,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

That great symphonic theme,

Richard Maltby,"You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar 
Two lovely eyes at me they were gleaming
Beaming I was star struck 
You're all my lucky charms I'm lucky in your arms
You've opened heaven's portal here on earth for this poor mortal
You are my lucky star
 
You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar 
If Garbo is a glamorous creature 
You're a four star feature 
Though you are never seen 
Up on a movie screen
You are my Shearer, Crawford, Hepburn, Harlow and my Garbo
You are my lucky star
",You Are My Lucky Star
Richard Marx,"Nobody told me
Every moment without you would seem so long
I get so lonely
And the nights have been so cold since you've been gone
Did I go and make believe the way you touched me
Was it real or just a game my mind was playing, tell me

[Chorus]
Was it the flame of love
Or was it just my imagination
Was it the flame of love
Or an act of desperation

It's amazing
How a love could feel so good then fade away
And replacing you with someone else is a game my heart won't play
Cause I know I'll never feel the heat that's in your soul
But I can't remember how I lost complete control
Tell me

[Chorus]

How could I know you'd ever go
Taking my dreams away with you
You lead me along
You did me wrong
I can't go on now, baby",The Flame of Love
Richard Marx,"Ships are moving closer to the shoreline
And we're laughing in the face of loaded guns
I saw it on the news, we ain't got no worry
But it won't be in the paper when D Day comes

Lord, Have Mercy
For we know not what we do
Have Mercy
We've forgotten to be afraid of you

Who can solve the problems of a nation
We cure the symptoms but we're killed by the disease
I feel I've more than made my contribution
But I hope there's room in heaven for my ego and me

Lord, Have Mercy
For we know not what we do
Have Mercy
We've forgotten to be afraid of you
Have Mercy
Lend us your hand
Lord, Have Mercy
Give us just another chance

Too many coaches on the sideline
Too many keepers in the zoo
How will we know we've passed the deadline
Give us the strength to stand or fall
God in heaven, Have Mercy on us all

The ships are even closer to the shoreline
Now we're playing in a madman's house of fun
I read it in the news we ain't got no worry
But it won't be in the paper when D Day comes

Lord, Have mercy",Have Mercy
Richard Marx,"I watch the world go round and round
And my life goes by at the speed of sound
I walk the night
And I wonder just where I belong, oh

My heart is young, but my soul is old
I've never been one to do what I was told
My back to the wall
Is the only place I can feel strong, oh

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows what lies before me
Heaven only knows what all my searching is for
All my life I've waited for a miracle
But I can't ask for anything more

I like to think I'm a faithful man
To resist desire, I do all I can
I hope to die in the arms of the woman I love, oh

Repeat chorus

I've always wondered how to know right from wrong
Looking for a reason to replace what is gone
But somehow the road just seems to lead right back to me

[Chorus]",Heaven Only Knows
Richard Marx,"Heart beat pounding so hard it keeps me wide awake at night
I wait alone in the dark for you to make the moment right
If I could only show you all that might be lost
Then you would never wonder what the secret was
And this is what I'd tell you

The lonely heart you see tonight
Will not give up without a fight
And I'm never gonna let it fade away

Oh, you can look in my eyes and see that you're the only one
I would break down and cry if you became the lonely one
I'd rather play the fool and try to hold a star
Than never know if you were going to break my heart
And I can see it shining

No matter what I say to make you understand
It's all up to you to take the future in your hands
So please don't keep me waiting",Lonely Heart
Richard Marx,"Nothing worth a damn can be sifted through the brain
Sense don't make the man but you insist on being sane
Don't take time to think or you're done before you start
There's no missing link cause it's right there in your heart

Take a closer look, there's an answer not a question
In that May December line
You'll bite a bigger hook
Than the one you want to leave behind

Remember Manhattan
Woody wasn't wrong
Remember Manhattan
Before you say so long

How you gonna tell if it stands the test of time
There's no wishing well that comes true without the dime
It's common curse that the grass is always greener
No matter what you have
But nothing could be worse
Than to try to reproduce the past

Remember Manhattan
Woody wasn't wrong
Remember Manhattan
Before you say so long
Remember Manhattan
What did Woody say
He said, remember Manhattan
Before you walk away

Lose your common sense
'Cause you may not get the chance again.",Remember Manhattan
Richard Marx,"You say you'll get over it
But I know you better
Your feelings have been hurt a bit
And you just can't forget her
You'll want her back by tomorrow
But she won't remember your name
You better

Get lost in the rhythm 
Get lost in the rhythm of life
Get lost in the rhythm
Get lost in the rhythm of life

You say that my soul is lost
And that you're my savior
You'll do anything at any cost
To reform my behavior
Didn't I make it this far
By making up my own mind
You gotta

Get lost in the rhythm 
Get lost in the rhythm of life",Rhythm of Life

Tumble inside my head
The way that we used to be
Things that we said

No one has ever made me believe so strong
You left me to wonder
How did our love go wrong

Where you running to now
Angelia
Got to make you turn around

I lie awake at night
Wait for the sun to shine
I still feel you next to me
Your lips on mine

Without a warning
You made our love a lie
You said you were sorry
But you never told me why

Angelia
Where you running to now

Got to make you turn around

Maybe my love is in vain
Maybe you're the hurting kind
Can't take no more of this pain

I gave you all I had
You left me with nothing
Nothing but a photograph

Richard Marx,"All that I know in my life, I have learned on the street
No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet

Will I wake up from this nightmare?
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many
I feel so all alone

[Chorus]
We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voice is strong, our future's bright
And thanks to what we learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

Left by my father with only this scar on my face
Told by my mother that, ""No, you were just a mistake.""
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
Some have paid to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside

Cause I've done my time in hell

Richard Marx,"One look in your innocent eyes
And I knew you had to be the one
You walked out of all of my dreams
Never thought the day would really come

I've been standing in a long desperate line

I may only be wasting my time
Don't know what else to do

If you turn me away
Just be careful what you say
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
Don't be mean, don't be cruel
Don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line

It's too late to be wishing I was
In somebody else's shoes this time
I'm tied up, like a slave to a chain
Praying that you'll please be kind

If it's true that love's a disease
Baby, I'm a dangerous case
I beg for mercy, got me down on my knees
You've got a smile on your face

If you turn me away
Just be careful what you say
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
Don't be mean, don't be cruel
Don't you treat me like a fool

Won't you show me, little girl

Richard Marx,"I know you have reservations
And you're just along for the ride
But I see a slight hesitation
What are you trying to hide

If you don't want my love
Tell me now cause I'll survive
If you don't want my love

You make a grown man quiver
It might be hard to believe

Richard Marx,"Have you heard the news?
I'm doing what I said I would
So now you say
Boy, I always knew you could

Murdered by reality
I gave you all I could give to you
But now I'm taking back what belongs to me

I read you like a drugstore book
How'd I ever think you were cool
You got no bait left on your hook
You're no friend and buddy, I'm no fool

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' you can do about it
Ain't nothin' you can say
ain't' nothin' you can do about it
No one's gonna stand in my way

I've done my time
I've given up my pound of flesh
So why can't the man seem to understand
That I've already passed the test

You did your best to keep me down
Tried to make my spirit give in
But I'm here to make a big, big sound
It's your turn to lose and it's my turn to win

[Chorus]

I know you can never go back
Once you turn and walk out that door
Got no time for worries like that
I'm not a kid anymore

You did your best to keep me down
Tried to make my spirit give in
But I'm here to make a big, big sound
It's your turn to lose and my turn to win

Richard Marx,"I remember me sittin' on my daddy's knee
Dreamin' 'bout what life had in store for me
When I look back now it really makes me mad
The years I took for granted were the best I had

School was alright
Gave me time to fantasize
But one day I woke up
And I realized

I'm livin' in the real world
Everything's written in black and white
Livin' in the real world
Where you don't get nothin' unless you fight

I want to relax but I don't know how
The pressures on me are much stronger now
I remember the days I didn't have a care
Aside from being afraid somebody'd cut my hair

I want to make it
Before my chances are gone
They say be patient
But it takes too long

Repeat chorus

Real world
Where there ain't no holiday in sight
Livin' in the real world
Where you don't get nothin' unless you fight

Someday soon I'll settle down for good
There was a time I thought I never would
I'm gonna live with a lady on a quiet beach
I'm gonna have three kids, maybe one of each

I've got to make it
Before my chances are gone
They say be patient
But it takes too long

Richard Marx,"Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you

Or how my heart breaks

Richard Marx,"We work our bodies weary to stay alive
There must be more to living than nine to five

Why should we wait for some better time
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride

Don't you know, I won't give up until I'm satisfied
Don't you know, why should I stop until I'm satisfied

Ignore the hesitation, that ties your hands
Use your imagination, and take a chance

I won't let my moment of truth pass me by
I've gotta make my move now or never
And if they turn me loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down

Richard Marx,"When you woke up this morning
On your front lawn
You had a smile on your lips and
Your wallet was gone
You remember some girl
But the rest is all a blur
Well you're not the first one to fall under
Her spell
I know dozens of guys who've been there
As well
They've got scars to show
And they owe 'em all to her.
[Chorus:]
That was Lulu
Did she fool you?
That was Lulu
That ain't legal
That ain't voodoo
That was Lulu
Well Lulu's got charms that money can't buy
And she's made her reputation
Making strong men cry
All the victims may change
But there stories are the same
Lulu's there whey your airplane
Just happens to crash
Still she walks away without even a scratch
Leaving in flames
But she never leaves her name

And I know what I'm talking about
I saw it all from the start
Long before she started running around
Who do you think ran away with my heart
That was Lulu
[Chorus]",That Was Lulu
Richard Marx,"What I had to flaunt
Has come back to haunt
Like a restless wind
And the best of times
That were left behind
They come blowing in

No one's pushing me through that door
But it might as well be a forty-four in the night

It's too late to say goodbye
I'm all out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

How can I resist
One more stranger's kiss
Should the thrill be gone
And if I must refrain
Will I wind up the same
As the jealous dogs?

From this day forward could be too long
But crossing that border would be so wrong, and you're right

It's too late to say goodbye
I've run out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye

I know that you're right
It's too late to say goodbye
I'm all out of lies
It's too late to say goodbye
This feeling won't die
It's too late to say goodbye
I can't watch you cry

Richard Marx,"I was born an only son
Didn't take to the rules, like a normal child
Prisoner of the things I've done
It's the price you pay livin' fast and wild

[Chorus]
I've spent too many nights lookin' over my shoulder
And the ways of the world make a heart grow colder
Got nowhere left to hide
The fight in me has died
So I must wait for the sunrise

Friend to fear and loaded gun
Live life like the owner of a heart of stone
No one touches, touch no one
But the road gets wary when you're all alone

Too much done to undo
No one I can run to
I need one more chance to live my life again

Richard Marx,"I've been searching
Not the first or the last
Trying to figure out the mystery of the half empty glass
Time is turning for the rest of the world
While a temporary leap of faith helps the story unfurl

They say that hearts don't stay broken
Even though the scars remain
And eyes don't stay swollen
Even if it feels that way

[Chorus]
But it's not that serious
I'm a big boy now
And I'm not that delirious
So don't show me how
Cause I've gotten beyond the agony
And my perspective is saving me

Never doubted what the cards would reveal
And if the joker showed his ugly face
Not that big of a deal
It's just a moment in the scheme of it all
But it's difficult to visualize when the axe starts to fall

But then a heart won't stay broken
Even on it's darkest day
The right door could open
Pick you up and drift away

[Chorus]

With all the confusion
How does anybody come through
But life is illusion
And no one can tell you what you've gotta do

You know a heart won't stay broken
Even on it's darkest day
The right door could open
Pick you up and drift away",Big Boy Now
Richard Marx,"I had a dream that you stood  right in front of me
And called to me in black and white
Though I could see you
I couldn't reach you
You faded into the light
And when the sun turns a dream to reality
I'm left with such an empty space
I feel your spirit
Know that I'm near it
I swear I can see your face

[Chorus]
Hear me calling you
Calling you
But you just don't seem to answer anymore

Am I supposed to pretend I don't feel the pain
Like it happened only yesterday
No use in trying
To stop the crying
I can't make it go away

[Chorus]

Hear me calling you
Calling you
But you just don't seem to answer anymore
I'm calling you
Calling you
And I'm afraid that you won't answer anymore

Where is the healing you promised me
Maybe this feeling will burn in me forever

But the vision is still the same
Out of my mind

Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart
Cause I've been lonely too long
You've got to break these chains around my heart
So I can finally get on with my life

Don't ask me why
Why I've lived with this all alone
Locked up inside
And it's cutting me to the bone
Love is a stranger avoiding me
Beware of danger's the only sign I see

Are you listening
Is there something that you'd like to say
Am I getting through
Are you just gonna leave me this way

Girl you've got to break these chains around my heart
Before it tears me in two
You've got to break these chains around my heart

Still we love to place the blame
We're running out of choices
And there's no rules to the game
I'm getting tired of feeling this way
What can a single man do, what can he say
Everyday you walk the edge of a knife
You're left with nothing at the end of your life

They've got their hands in your pocket
They;ll take the clothes off your back
Hands in your pocket
They'll stop you like a heart attack

We put people into power but we fight our wars alone
They take such good care of the rest of the world
But what about the folks at home, oh yeah
Point the finger at the man you chose
He'll say he's sorry but it's just the way it goes
He sits in judgement like a king on a throne
'Till that November when he'll beg for a bone

They've got their hands in your pocket
They'll take the clothes off your back

Richard Marx,"""My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came to know Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
And saw the man inside

We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

I think about my life gone by
And how it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town",Hazard

But I'm the one who keeps the pressure on

All I've got is all I need
But I get no sleep and I'm tired to the bone
All I've got is all I need

Just keeping up with this town
I' m a roadrunner racing, but I don't see the signs
I've got to learn to slow down

My life makes it hard to complain
But there's times I'd take my school days back again

Who had had it all her way
Now just another hanger on
With a faded resume
He's gonna be a leading man
In the Gary Cooper mold
Now working at a pretzel stand
But it's him that's getting sold

Big dreamer gonna take the town
But she's running out of time
Still singing at a sleazy lounge
To a house of drooling swine

With a body like a god
He's thinking that's all there is
But I don't want that job

They don't hear the crying
Streets of pain
Never felt the tears
Streets of pain
They just keep on lying
Get it through your head
'Cause some things never change

Won't it finally be obvious
That there's very little chance
Can't they see it's a Greyhound bus
And not their handsome prince
Isn't anybody satisfied
With the average girl next door
Does she have to be glamourized
So the world will love her more

Streets of pain
Sinking like a rock in a river
Streets of pain
Never felt so cold

Lower than a snake can slither

Stories never told

Standing in somebody elses light
Anything can happen late at night
In the morning she'll be out of sight
Made a million on a lucky streak
Threw it all away as foolishly
One of many comic tragedies
What else can there be

To the desolation station
And you better bring all you own

In your bed
Maybe it all happened to you just a
Little too fast

Won't let anybody touch you

Plain to see there's a woman

And your money won't 
Get you very far
You're a mystery,

You face the end of your youth in a tired
Little masquerade
You talk to people with a tongue like a 
Newly sharpened razor blade
Yours is not a life that lets you take a
Look inside
Morals and convictions meet a fate of
Genocide
But in the end you'll be sleeping in the
Bed you made

This is your world now
No one can chase all your fears away
This is your world now

I saw the future in my mother's eyes
Filled with tears of sorrow

The years roll by, the times do change
The truth around us harder to disguise
As we face tomorrow

So many promises were made me
So little hope remains alive
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive

You'll see what I'm saying
When you're on your own
The war that you're facing
Isn't yours alone

I'm a man in search of reasons
Though I am still as much to blame
It's up to me leave you more than just my name

This is your world now
No one can chase all your fears away
Fight for your world now
I know that somehow you'll find your way
Trust your heart to lead the way

I'm holding on to what I can
Like any other lucky man
Love won't strike me, love won't sell me out

[Chorus]",Heaven's Waiting
Richard Marx,"You never know what we could be in store for
The way it goes we're in for more of  the same
One step beyond the flame
The thread of life, the finely woven pattern
Reveals designs in silent laughter and rhyme
One picture at a time

[Chorus]
There ain't nothing left behind us
Not a doubt inside us
If the angel calls tomorrow, there's nothing we haven't said
There ain't nothing left behind us
Nothing but a blind trust
I would beg, steal or borrow to never lose you again

It's down to us to figure out the secret
It's not enough to wait for pieces to fall
The writing isn't on the wall
Take my hand, we'll face the fire together
To distant lands, but we can weather the storm
Keeping each other warm

[Chorus]

There's never been an easy way
Everybody is bound to make mistakes
You just do what you think is right
Then laugh 'til you cry 'til you scream at the night

[Chorus]",Nothing Left Behind Us
Richard Marx,"There in my darkest hour, somehow you knew what I felt
And just in the nick of time you saved me from myself
Didn't know I could cut through my defenses
And see through the mask
I figured you must want something from me, but you never asked
I just had to call and you were always there
I think you must have been the answer to my prayer

With you I've got nothing to hide
My heart is starting to pound
Now the walls are tumbling down

I wish I could find the words that linger just out of reach
I see myself in your eyes and lose my power of speech
I am someone now that I don't recognize
It took someone like you to shatter my disguise

Now I've got nothing to hide
My heart's remembering to pound
I can feel the walls coming down
I've got nothing to hide
All that I needed was you around
Now the walls are tumbling down

Head in the sky, feeling just like some kind of lovesick child
I finally pulled through, and I owe it to you, don't want to keep it inside

I am someone now that I don't recognize
Oh I'm healing, I'm believing, you made me realize",Nothing to Hide
Richard Marx,"It's a peaceful thing to know that freedom as a rule belongs to me
There's something very wrong when the color of a man is all you see
After all this time how can a single voice explain
Any reason for the pain we all have seen
It's not a dream

[Chorus]
One man stood tall
And faced the devil with his back to the wall
And took one step closer to heaven above

So he took a stand and walked where no one else would dare to even try
It was the only way
If not for bravery, the soul would surely die
And right before my eyes he gave his life unselfishly
So that all the father's children could be free
Like you and me

[Chorus]

Before his work is done
We've got to put an end to this game of choosing sides
I want us to be one
And I won't let it go 'till it's over
I'm here waiting

[Chorus]

I'm waiting, waiting",One Man
Richard Marx,"There was nothing missing, it was just a case of foolishness
Girl, I must've been crazy
Something I would just as soon forget
I can only say I'm sorry and leave it up to you to say the rest

[Chorus]
If you want to go, girl, I won't stand in your way
But I'll stand by you if you decide you want to stay
Baby, don't you see
Doesn't have to be forever or goodbye
All I'm asking for is one more try

I'm the one who hurt you, still I know the pain you're going through
And even if you show forgiveness, there may be too much damage to undo
I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you

[Chorus]

My heart and soul are searching
Trying to find a way
To bring your love back to me

Still I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you

[Chorus]",One More Try
Richard Marx,"Twenty four and he believes for sure he's got it made
Fame is here for good and looks will never fade
He doesn't know
The game is never over 'till the cards have all been played

Eighty three and still he feels his best is yet to come
He believes that youth is wasted on the young
He's alone
The only dream he ever has is being with someone

[Chorus]
Love you when you're standing tall
But nobody knows when you when you're falling
All you have to do is call
But nobody ever hears the silent scream

Christmas came and went again but still nobody came
Staring at her wedding photo in a frame
She's alone
We should hope the loss of memory helps to ease the pain

[Chorus]

Memories, moments you recall
We should be remembered for the greatest of them all
You can't begin to live someone else's life
Or you're own will pass you by

Oh, who's to know
Maybe we can learn a thing or two from everyone

[Chorus]",Silent Scream
Richard Marx,"I've got the fever, poison in my veins
My mind ain't working right
I know the answer, the way to ease this pain
Only got myself to fight
I can see clearly but choose to be blind
A slave to desire
Holding me, scolding me, changing your mind
You're like playing with fire

[Chorus]
I need you
I want to stay on this soul motin' ride
There is no danger when you're here by my side

Given some distance, just a little time
Right and wrong seems clear
But my sense of reason is nothing but unkind
Every time that you're near
Over and over I say to myself
Ooh, she's only playing
Ten thousand reasons to find someone else
Still I hear myself saying

[Chorus]

I'm out here on the edge
And I know what's in store
It should be over and done, just let go and run
But I've tasted too much
Nothing's the same anymore

[Chorus]",Soul Motion
Richard Marx,"I'll have this feeling 'till the day that I die
When I hear my baby calling
A simple motion, a look in her eyes
And I'm helplessly falling
I'd give all of somebody else
For any piece of her heart that's left
She knows me better than I know myself

[Chorus]
Let me tell you 'bout the way she loves me
Ooh, I want the world to know
I'm crazy 'bout the way she loves me
Ooh, I'm proud to let it show, yeah, yeah, yeah

Came close to letting this train pass me by
Just like a fool second guessing
I could've spent my life wondering why
I didn't cherish the blessing
If I'd have known she'd come my way
The lonely nights would have been okay
I have her promise that she's gonna stay

[Chorus]

Nobody else could do me right
A breath of heaven in my darkest night
I'm gonna hold on with all of my might

[Chorus]",The Way She Loves Me
Richard Marx,"Your situation's in need of help
You're gettin' so you don't know yourself
You wear his ring like a cheap disguise
But I can see you got wandering eyes
Don't believe it's just the clothes that make the man
No one else can love you like I know I can

[Chorus]
I got what you want
Takes more than money to turn you on
I got what you need
c'mon baby take a chance on me

Somethin' 'bout your smile seems counterfeit
It ain't in you to be a hypocrite
So he's got a mansion, got lots of cash
You live like a queen but feel like trash
I can save you if you put your heart in mine
Baby, can't you see, we're two of the same kind, Yeah

[Chorus]

Baby, there ain't nothin' keeping chains on you
Don't you let your head make up your mind

I can't get you off my mind
I'm afraid I may go blind
Won't you let me take you for a ride, yeah",What You Want
Richard Marx,"Never knew love before
Never dreamed there could be something more
Felt my heart overflow
With the danger of needing you so

It's a mystery I can't explain
But I shiver when I hear your name

You are the fire
Every desire
Breathless we fall in love
Love is the answer
We are the dancers
Breathless we fall in love
We fall in love

You've crept into my soul
And I'm ready to lose all control
Let our hearts fill with light
Every moment you make is so right

It's a mystery I can't explain
But I shiver when I hear your name

Richard Marx,"I whispered you
Words I thought I'd never say
We played the game
But then we tossed the rules away
Could deny it
Justify it
But we both know we went too far
Oh, I can feel you
And I need you
No matter wherever you are

[Chorus]
I don't want to watch my love come crashing down
But I can't lie to my heart
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round
But baby I just can't lie to my heart

I have loved you
Longer than you've even known
When you hurt I hurt
I'm your flesh and you're my bone
If I could only
Be two people
Darlin' I swear we'd both be with you
Oh, I know I'm selfish
But I'm helpless
I  want you and nothing else will do

[Chorus]

I won't pretend anymore
Been hiding too long
I won't go on like before
I'm not that strong
I can feel it when I'm near you
It's not healthy to need you this way

But this pain is stronger than me and it won't go away

[Chorus]",Can't Lie to My Heart
Richard Marx,"I was born on the banks of eternity
A page of the history it teaches
Not a care, lived my life like a hurricane
Leaving everything along the way in pieces

Some may have cheered, some may have wondered
If I am flesh, if I am stone
Thoughts of you tear through me like thunder
You are the light that has led me back home

Take me to the river, baby
Wash away the lies
I've got no reputation living in your eyes
Take me to eternity
Let me bury this disguise

A southern boy has it harder sometimes
It's like you were climbing a razor
You were there when my dreams had all turned to dust
And the man in the mirror was a stranger

Look at me now, a soulless survivor
No mask can hide the man that I've made
You ease my pain
Your make it silent
Slowly I feel it beginning to fade

I want to feel it
Rushing over me into the tide
I want to taste it
Every moment 'til the end of my life

I have laid still, adrift in you memory
Hoping your faith would erase all the years
Maybe some time, maybe some magic
Maybe your love will make everything clear

Take me to the river, baby
Wash away the lies
I've got no reputation living in your eyes
Take me to eternity
Let me bury this disguise

Take me to the river, baby

There are no expectations hiding in your eyes

And let me bury this disguise",Eternity

And I know my heart won't beat the same again
You will always be the shadow of a doubt

Windy city square
If all that sells is tragedy I haven't got a prayer

Should I try to lose it all, kick it off the track
Just to say I took the fall but ""look who's comin back""

What's the story, where's the dirt
Nobody's happy til somebody gets hurt
I don't want t keep up with all that
The garbage that you swallow gonna someday make you fat

Normal childhood, beautiful wife
Excuse me having a wonderful life
Why should I be hungry for someone else's pain
Heroes should have something but talent for fame
Double barrel in the mouth nails it every time
But that's what legend's all about
Ain't no bigger headline

What's the story, where's the dirt
Nobody's happy til somebody gets hurt
I don't want to keep up with all that
The garbage that you swallow gonna someday make you fat
Maybe I should frequent all the places that I¡¯m avoiding
And maybe you should work on building rather than destroying

If this is making friends, I'd rather be lonely
So where's that leave a guy like me

What's a man supposed to do

I don't get no kick from nine to five
And I'm not a man who thinks it's true

And even if you don't go all the way,
I know that you'll go far

Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, Oh no

Lots of promises in the dark

Make you the winner of a losing fight
But the party is never over
Cause stars are always shining
Doesn't matter if it's day or night

And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you want to scream, but you gotta keep it all inside

Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine

Richard Marx,"Born at the end of a Minnesota freeze
Eldest child of Willy and Louise
His little sister died at the age of four
The family posed, led by Louise
Like right out of some kind of Rockwell scene
But Jake couldn't fake it anymore

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'
Sensed that judgment day was callin'
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door
Everybody loves to point their finger
They might as well have pulled the trigger
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door

Willy later said, ""He really should've known
The boy spent too much time on his own
And what was on his mind, God only knew""
One by one the neighbors went away
A gruesome little game Jake taught himself to play
His daddy always said, ""Find something to do""

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'
Sensed that judgment day was callin'
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door
Everybody loves to point their finger
They might as well have pulled the trigger
Nobody stopped to hear the boy next door

One less mistake to think about
'Cause no one read the writing on the wall
So much for case 1239
Covered up, curled up in a ball

One little page in the history of crime
Lawyers made a fortune for their time
Seems an explanation was never found
And I hope this tale won't be misunderstood
Things ain't the same in every neighborhood
But before you go to sleep tonight, look around

Nobody heard the hammer fallin'
Sensed that judgment day was callin'
Nobody thought to fear the boy next door

I will remember nights in your arms
I will remember days in Avalon
And I will recall every moment
Of my days in the sun

As I embrace the twilight
The memories surround me
I would have been lost
Sure as the rain comes
If you hadn't found me

Each breath I breathe is for you
I never knew how to live 'til you taught me to

[Chorus]
I will run through the door
I'm not afraid anymore
And the light that I see is your eyes
Once again I'll be whole
I will live in your soul
Longer than the rest of our lives

[Chorus]",Days in Avalon
Richard Marx,"No one can decide
 When lightning will strike
 And everything falls into place
 But lately it seems
 When you're in my dreams
 I find that I don't want to wake

 I want to slowly
 Unlock the mystery
 I want to make love
 I want to make history

 [Chorus:]
 With you
 I see a lifetime with you
 And if one thing is true
 It's that God knew someday I'd be standing
 On the edge of forever with you

 I'm ready to fall
 To give you my all
 Cause you're everything I'll ever want
 It's amazing to me
 How far we can see
 Our horizon goes on and on

 I want to slowly
 Unlock the mystery
 I want to make love
 I want to make history

[Chorus:]
 And when I'm shivering
 Your body will be my blanket
 And then I'm drifting, baby
 You'll be my anchor

[Chorus:]",The Edge of Forever
Richard Marx,"Mesmerized since the day I saw you
Maybe somewhere I've misplaced my pride
In trying to prove I'm on your side
We're two of the many walking wounded
And all I want is to try to be the cure
So we'll never feel loneliness anymore

[Chorus:]
I want to be declared your one and only
Hear you say that I'm your destiny
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me

Am I making you feel uneasy
Do you recognize the movie that we're in
Every game you swore you'd never play you win
Do you want to know the truth about you
Do you even hear the voices in your head
Can't you see I'm hanging there by a thread

I want to feel your gentle arms around me
Want to know the sweet taste of your kiss
Want to hear you whisper
""Baby, nothing's better than this""
I want to be declared your one and only
Hear you say that I'm your destiny
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me

[Chorus:]

The more I reach out to you
The harder you are to find
How could I be so drawn to something so unkind

Do I make you feel uneasy
Am I saying any words you want to hear
Love isn't really love without fear

[Chorus:]",More Than a Mystery
Richard Marx,"Nothing I must do
Nowhere I should be
No one in my life
To answer to, but me
No more candlelights
No more purple skies
No one to be near
As my heart slowly dies

If I could hold you one more time
Like in the days when you were mine
I'd look at you
Till I was blind
So you would stay
I'd say a prayer each time you sign
Cradle the moments like a child
I'd stop the world if only i
Could hold you one more time
Mmmmmm
I've memorized your face
I know your touch by heart
Still lost in your embrace
I dream of where you are

If I could hold you one more time
Like in the days when you were mine
I'd look at you
Till I was blind
So you would stay
I'd say a prayer each time you sign
Cradle the moments like a child
I'd stop the world if only i
Could hold you one more time
Mmmmmm",One More Time
Richard Marx,"Everybody's talking, the world is goin' round
Rumors are flying all over the town
How could a stranger know what's still a
mystery to me

I don't know what to call it
I don't know what it is
I only know for certain I've never felt like this
And, baby, it's the one thing I can believe

There's nothing I fear in this life
Long as I've got you by my side

[Chorus]
We're mighty as a hurricane, tougher than stone
Stronger than anything I've ever known
One look at us together anybody could see
There ain't nothin' that can stand up to
The power of you and me

We're only good together, no good on our own
Everything about you feels just like home
Before you I don't remember how I got along

You are the spark to my flame
The only one that burns in your name

[Chorus]
So many souls searching for
What we're holding right in our hands
You're the woman that makes me a better man

[Chorus]",Power of You and Me
Richard Marx,"The tree you planted
Is still holding on
Leaves are turning
Like nothing's wrong
Oh, what freedom
To only need the rain

Been without you since May, ninety-four
Tricks of the mind make it feel like it's more
But I'm not special
It's the same for everyone

[Chorus]
Hold on, baby
I'm coming for you
I can hear your voice through the wine
Teach me how to turn the page
And show me how to shine

Times I wished I was already gone
Ain't no place I can't leave when I want
But then I see their faces
And I'm frozen in my shame

[Chorus]

Sometimes the sun shuts down the little I can see
And I remember what it felt like to be me
But all at once I know that nothing is the same
And all I'm left with is the pain

[Chorus]",Shine
Richard Marx,"I've lived life in a single room
Hiding my scars from the moon
I dream my dreams in the light

Rehearse the lines I already know
Basking in the tv's glow
And pray that tonight is the night

Oh, there's gotta be more than this
A future hanging on a stranger's kiss
Could it be I'm not so alone

I'm someone special
I'm just in disguise
I may not be perfect
In everyone's eyes
It may not be tomorrow
But I still believe
There's someone special
Waiting out there for me

I guess the joke hasn't hit me yet
Cause I'm still waiting on my juliet
She must be held up somewhere

Ooh, she will be the air I breathe
She'll come for good and never want to leave
And I'll love her only, I swear

People say there must be something wrong
For me to be all alone so long
And their words hit me like a stone

I'm someone special
I'm just in disguise
I may not be perfect
In everyone's eyes
It may not be tomorrow
But I still believe
There's someone special
Waiting out there for me

Lying in bed in a cold, cold sweat
Dreaming 'bout women I'll never get
I won't always be sleeping alone

I'm someone special
I'm just in disguise
I may not be perfect
In everyone's eyes
It may not be tomorrow
But I still believe
There's someone special
Waiting out there for me",Someone Special
Richard Marx,"The sun's still warm and most days are good
The world still turns like you said it would
But this pain seems to never let me go
And there is really no movin' on
There's only going along

And I will always be
Better for you loving me
Better for the times we shared
That travel with me everywhere

And I will always try
To hold my head up to the sky
If only just to let you know
That straight from my heart
I still miss you so

If I could I would gladly trade
A thousand tomorrows for one yesterday
There are so many things that I would say
You're a part of every memory
That lives on in me

[Chorus: ]",Straight from My Heart
Richard Marx,"With another day another life slips away
And floats above the crowd
You can only stay ahead of time when time co-operates
Instead of heading south
Cards are dealt
You play what you hold
You can't tell me the story's been told

[Chorus: ]
It's too early to be over
And it's way past when
It could be starting again
It's too early to be over
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know

Run down run around biting my tongue
Hardly my sad tale
But the rolling in and steppin' out
Nothing but fun
I finally had to bail
Nothing worse than trying too hard
This ain't this fool's first walk in the park

It's too early to be over
I don't feel a thing from the bone to the skin
It's too early to be over
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know

Somewhere out there it all evens out
So they would have you believe
But that don't get me
That won't set me free

It's too early to be over
And it's way past when it could be starting over
It's too early to be over
Always the fave but I already gave

[Chorus: ]",Too Early to Be Over
Richard Marx,"How long is it s'posed to take
Which song got the answer straight
I thought I sang 'em all
What face am I gonna make
Which leg to I have to break
To know I took the fall

It's like I'm standing on the edge of madness
Save me from crossing that line
Sure that I'll never come back

[Chorus: ]
With the dawn, life goes on
How long can I keep waiting on your love
Hold my breath, give me strength
How long can I keep holding on
How long can I keep waiting on your love

True love is a funny thing
Too much for a diamond ring
To guarantee applause
Too late when you have to guess
Which joke's taken as tenderness
Penny for your thoughts

Just like I'm hanging off the edge of madness
Stop me from falling so far
How can you let me let go

[Chorus: ]

I keep every moment frozen in time
And if they're all I get, I'll be cold the rest of my life

[Chorus: ]",Waiting on Your Love
Richard Marx,"Whenever I'm weary from the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness when my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever I will be your man.

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune that heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever I will be your man
Now and forever I will be your man",Now and Forever [Live]
Richard Marx,"There's been no sunlight
Since the day you said goodbye
Since the moment that my life
Turned into a masquerade

I can't even pretend to
Paste a smile across my face
All my dreams have been erased
There's nothing left to save me

And you
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling
When everything is closing in
And you
You're the only one can stop this heart from aching
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking
And put me back together
Again

What I'd give just to wake up
And wipe your memory from my eyes
But I can't wish for bluer skies
I've never been quite so hopeless

And you
You're the only one can stop my sky from falling
You're the only one who's name I keep on calling
When everything is closing in

You're the only one can stop this heart from aching
You're the only one who can stop me from shaking
And put me back together

I fear it will all be too much
And if you stay away
I'll be a man who's lost his touch

You're the only one who's name I keep on calling

As I contemplate the losing
The silence is up way too loud

[Chorus]
I can't sleep anymore
The words I never said keep turning over
I can't dream like before
And all I seem to be getting is colder

Just like the t-shirt that you wore
You were divine and full of madness
Not really like anyone
In words too beautiful for words

I constructed a soliloquy
That never seemed to reach my tongue
Yeah the air never even filled my lungs

[Chorus]

All I can think of is
My name on your lips

These things happen everyday
I should be able to smile by now

All of the stars in the sky
With you went perfect sunsets
Sleeping my way through the night
Yeah with you went
Everything good in this world

Desperate for your touch
I haven't been needing much
Why let the music play?
I can't hear it anyway

[Chorus]

'Cause with you went
The scent of flowers
Don't they just die anyway?
And with you went

All the rainbows
Now when it rains it's just gray
Yeah, with you went
Everything good in this world

And I thought of doing something rash
In the hopes of making you feel bad
But it seems that it's always me that ends up cryin'

That I think I'm ready to share
It may bring us closer
It may be a burden to bear

It's precious and it's real
And all that I can feel

Is that I'm falling
As deep as any ocean
In ways that can't be spoken
I am falling
For the millionth and the first time
Ever and eternally for you

You are a beacon
Revealing the places I hide
You've given freedom
To so much that I kept inside

And with one look in my eyes
It can't be a surprise

That I am falling
As deep as any ocean
In ways that can't be spoken
I am falling
For the millionth and the first time
Ever and eternally for you

Now there's no darkness
My truth laid open and bare
It's in my flesh and bones
Yeah it's everywhere

That I am falling
As deep as any ocean

Ever and eternally for you",Falling
Richard Marx,"Elusive happiness
Can be like promises
That rest so gently on our pillow
We stood out on the ledge
And leaned over the edge
And nearly fell right through that window
There were those who had us done by now
Baby, we've only just begun

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on
It may look out of reach
And time may rob us like a thief
But love goes on
Our love goes on

No one may recognize
What lives behind our eyes
Sometimes the good times are the hardest
And when my strength is gone

It's you that I lean on
A light at the end of all my darkness
And in the end if I know nothing else
The answer is only in your arms

The world may crash and burn
Or suddenly just cease to turn
But love goes on

Days go by in a pulseless haze
Who's that person that's wearin' my face
Denyin' what he's hidin'

I can't go on like this
I won't let myself miss the rest of my life

When something's come and gone, what good is holdin' on?
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say

I guess we could carry on livin' asleep
Who is the fool who could choose to just keep pretendin'
That this ain't endin'?
I wish you all that I wish for myself
To have that ache of emptiness behind us
And not still inside us

It's time to take that dare
There's still a world out there waitin' for me

When something's come and gone what good is holdin' on?
Why waste tomorrow chasin' yesterday?
I part my lips to speak but the words are out of reach
I guess that really means there's nothin' left to say

Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'
I would be better off dead
Yeah? I'm in over my head

You made me weak, I made you laugh
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab
The taste of your kiss is with me even now
But this thing we've got goes by different names
Never two days in a row the same
I wanna stop feelin' this, but don't know how

I see my legs and they're moving
But I just can't walk away

The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'
I'm in over my head
Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'
I would be better off dead
Yeah? I'm in over my head

I'll say goodbye, but talk is cheap
I count the memories in my sleep
I've had enough, but I want more

Makin' me weak, makin' you laugh
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab
Baby, your kiss is with me even now

The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'

Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'
I would be better off dead
Yeah? I'm in over my head",Over My Head

And I think I hear those sleigh bells ring
Oh oh

I gotta get the Christmas spirit
I can't get anywhere near it
But I'm here hoping desperately
I'll do it up with all the trimmings
Christmas tree and carols singing
Anything to bring my baby back to me

All I want's a happy ending
Waiting there when I get home
I don't want to wind up spending
Another winter all alone

I hope it's not too much to ask
I'm sure you must be busy
So I'll try to end this story fast

Richard Marx,"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head:
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said,
""For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.""

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, good will to men.""

Till, ringing singing, on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
Of peace on earth, good will to men!",I Heard the Bells On Christmas Day
Richard Marx,"O holy night,
The stars are brightly shining;
It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees,
O hear the angel voices!
O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine, O night,",O Holy Night

Where we said goodbye
I turn and I see you
But don't trust my eyes
You look at me
And I can't breathe

For when this day would come
But standing here now
I can't find even one
All I want to say
Is written on my face

[Chorus]
I close my eyes every time I wake up
'Cause every little thing makes me think of
When you loved me
When you loved me
And I don't really want to talk about the weather
The truth is that I was better
When you loved me 
When you loved me

I'm sure that there's somewhere that you've got to go
But give me one more minute
One more memory to hold
And wherever you're goin' to
Take this with you

I try to wish you away
You're gone today but
You'll be back tomorrow

That I call goodbye
Won't let go
Won't let me go

Waiting for the sun to reach the sky 
Life was beautiful, anything was possible 
Never knew the meaning of goodbye

Things were oh so simple 
I prayed that it would never end

And our love lives in every memory 
The sweetest days never fade away 
And when I need to feel them close to me 
I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

I still remember when you were maybe 9 or 10 
Afraid of shadows on your wall 
I would hold you tight
Tell you everything's alright 
I'm just a few steps down the hall

Things were oh so simple then 
What I'd give to live it all again

But our love lives in every memory 
The sweetest days never fade away 
And when I need to feel them close to me 
I think of Christmas mornings and how it used to be

Yes our love lives in every memory

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Richard Purvis,"O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel",O Little Town

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

On met du temps à comprendre
Ce que le cœur veut entendre
Ce que le cœur voudrait comprendre
On met du temps, du temps à l’entendre

Fini le shift de nuit
Ça rit sur la galerie
Tout un monde qui respire
Le bonheur qui s’étire

Une ride avec toi
Au cœur de l’été
On était les premiers
À découvrir le fleuve

C’était presque rien
Mais on était bien
Des mots comme des reflets
Dans tes pays muets

On met du temps à comprendre
Ce que le cœur  veut entendre
Ce que le cœur voudrait comprendre
On met du temps, du temps à l’entendre

Chu passé sans raison
Devant la maison

Richard Séguin,"J’avance à pied dans mes pensées
Des ronds dans l’eau pour te chanter
Je cherche de l’or dans la rivière
Une vérité parmi les pierres

J’avance à pied dans mes nuits
Quand je n’ai plus rien à offrir
Je veux me taire, me reconstruire
Loin du vulgaire « à tout prix »

Devant mes pas
Le vent s’est levé
Sur l’eau, le feu, l’aube et la nuit
Quand on marche côte à côte
Avec ses rêves ce qu’on en fait

J’avance à pied dans les mots
Pour les porter à l’abri
Loin des froideurs, loin du mépris
Du temps perdu loin de nous-même

J’avance à pied dans ma peur
De m’engourdir de m’endurcir 
On croit n’avoir besoin de rien
On est comme la bête qui a faim

Devant mes yeux
Le vent s’est levé
Sur l’eau, le feu, l’aube et la nuit
Quand on marche côte à côte
Avec ses rêves ce qu’on en fait

Dans mon âme
Le vent s’est levé
Sur l’eau, le feu, l’aube et la nuit
Quand on marche côte à côte
Avec ses rêves ce qu’on en fait

Richard Séguin,"Elle dit j’ai 20 ans
Pas d’amour, pas d’argent
Mais je garde mon enfant
À l’abri des grands vents
Se cacher pour pleurer
Faire comme si rien n’était
J’voudrais me reposer
Me coucher dans l’été

Dans ma peau pour une heure
Mets-toi dans ma peau

J’ai moins de 15 ans
Mais mon cœur  a mille ans
Dans mon regard d’enfant
Toutes les blessures du temps
J’danse pour étourdir

Et quand le jour se lève
J’espère une trêve

Dans ma peau pour une heure
Mets-toi dans ma peau

Arrachée aux forêts

Dans ma peau pour une heure
Mets-toi dans ma peau

Quand  la vérité sort
De la bouche du métro
On l’entoure d’un décor
De pubs ou de drapeaux

Richard Séguin,"Laisse ouverte un peu la fenêtre
Qu’on voit le monde et ses travers
La grande patience des solitaires
Et l’arrogance des millionnaires

Laisse ouverte un peu la fenêtre 
Que sorte enfin la poésie
Qu’elle coure toute seule en pleine nuit
Offrir au monde ses rêveries

Il faut des mots
Des mots très beaux
Pour provoquer 
Le monde entier
Il faut des mots
Des mots très chauds
Pour apaiser les cœurs blessés

Laisse ouverte un peu la fenêtre
Que l’amour se mêle à la terre
Le bonheur n’est pas une tanière
Il doit courir dans les fougères

Laisse ouverte un peu la fenêtre
Que la lune éclaire nos chagrins
Que des étoiles tombent dans nos mains
Et que nos rires s’entendent au loin

Richard Séguin,"Que dit le cœur au fond du silence
Que disent les mots effacés par la pluie
Que dit la voix loin de toute arrogance

Me regarde et me sourit

À quoi bon courir
Tu auras peur,
tu auras froid
Tu voudras fuir les voies
Qui te feront la vie dure

À quoi bon courir
Traverser saisons
Sur ton sac de douleurs
Tu reposeras ta tête et ton coeur.

À quoi bon courir
C’est écrit depuis toujours
Tu brûleras ces cahiers
Qui te sont si précieux
Fatigué mais heureux
De tout recommencer

Avant de repartir ?

Et fredonne cet air

Seront toujours là
Toujours là près de toi
Amies des combats
Qui ne finissent jamais
Amies de l’espoir
Dans la froideur des heures

Que mémoire de lumière
De toutes petites flammes
Vérités qui font les jours

I almost drove right by you
Can I give you a hand
Is there somewhere I can take you

By now, by now, by now

Stolen from your sleepy land
Cut loose from her, my caloused hand
Branded you an exile

The ocean parted when you wailed
And debris of your catastrophe
Set sail inside a silver cup
That she handed to me

No ocean deep, no mountain tall
No liberty, no prison vault
Can keep my baby refugee
From his own inland sea

Where he can play castaway
Where he can play castaway
Where he can play castaway

Now on a dolphin's back I come to you
Bounding from across the blue
Swollen flood inside my vein
To try to explain

How someday far below the moon
You may live beside a green lagoon
And store up pearls for skipping stones
And you'll never be alone

Ocean fall or ocean rise
I see her deep, deep in your eyes
I'm an ocean apart from you
But you'll always be a part of me

'Cause I can play castaway
Two can play castaway
Three can play castaway
We all play castaway",Castaway

Dry leaves stirred up by the breeze
Sleeping dog picks up the scent
In the the wind he senses

The cracking brance, the swinging gate
The distant thunder on the way
All of this can by explained
As but the trappings of the trouble
All the trouble in our hearts

The house so still, the moon so bright
You awake, I catch your eye
You take my hand to touch your thigh
It's time we took hold of the

Curtains blown in by the wind
Without a word you take me in
Sleeping dog picks up the scent
As we chase away the trouble
All the trouble in our hearts

Gone out prowling for the dawn

Alone and howling at the trouble",Howling at the Trouble
Richard Shindell,"I sold my old Camaro
I sold my fishing boat
A friend said he would cosign
On a small commercial loan
So I shopped around until I found
A rig within my means
I put fifteen thousand dollars down
On the Kenworth of my dreams

My sister's husband helped me out
When we took the thing apart
Every bolt and piston
I knew them all by heart
We cleaned her out and painted her
And brought her up to speed
I proudly put my name upon
The Kenworth of my dreams

But sometimes late at night
Out on some interstate
I hear those sad country songs
True love found, true love gone
Lately I just turn the damn thing off

A lot of folks just shook their heads
Convinced that I'd lost mine
They said living in a God-damned truck
Is just a waste of time
That to spend yhour life behind the wheel
Ain't as great as it might seem
I just thanked them all and left one night
In the Kenworth of my dreams

But sometimes late at night
Out on some interstate
I hear those sad country songs
True love found, true love gone
Lately I just turn the damn thing off

Business, it's been pretty good
I've no cause to complain
I haul bourbon up to Buffalo
And frozen foods to Maine
Toxic waste or Quaker State
It's all the same to me
I'll go anywhere for anything
In the Kenworth of my dreams....

Richard Shindell,"New York has been buried in snow since last Saturday
The papers said the storm had passed over you
Thank you for the play you wrote about Heloise
And her injury at the hand of an almighty memory

And I might have guessed
That you'd press a rose in the pages
Where Abelard confesses 
His love and his pain
To her lips 

And Nora, it was no sin
They could turn the other cheek
Or take it on the chin 
But Nora, it was no sin 

So Christmas was as blue for you as it was for me
All those angels trumpeting their ecstasy

Your husband has accepted the parish in Greenland
I met him drowning his vows at the bar

And there we raised
The first and the next
And a third glass to you
Hunched on our bar-stools
Calling our truce
By your name 

And Nora, there is no sin 
We can turn the other cheek
Or take it on the chin 

But Nora, there is no sin 
Nora, there is no sin 
Nora, there is no sin",Nora
Richard Shindell,"I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of a sorry old elm
Give the gypsy moths a realm of their own
For a postman's fee would I work for Thee
From that tree would I swoop down and leave
A billion blue eggs of eternity
And in no time you'd have your own See

Don't just stare
I mean it, really
Hear my prayer
I give it freely
Are you there Fleur-de-Lis?

I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of willow
And fly around not wearing a stitch
For so long has this room been so hollow
We wait at the gate for an echo
In the flesh of your newly cleaned frescoes
Where Jesus holds John to his breast

Wrapped around
And rocking slowly
No one bound
To be so holy
In your gown of fleur-de-lis

I adore thee Mother Mary
But would you change me back to a witch
As a witch would I love you more than any man
So give a wink, give a nod, but give a damn
Be a sport, Mary, and don't tell Dad
He need never know how He's been had
And never you mind about those seven seals
Daddy was a one shot deal

There we'd be

Richard Shindell,"My name is William Taylor
I was born in '24
Too late to know the Great Fallen
In time to know the Great Fall
When my father died of money
My mother lived in spite
We laughed when nothing was funny
And how we wept when nothing was left

So I left there in boomtown
When I reached fifteen years
I travelled mostly northeast
With my head held mostly down

'Cause they said there was more in Baltimore
Where those shipyards never close
You can sell the man your labor
And send the money home

Broadway found me penniless
The mission found me last
They gave me a coat and three days rest
And when I awoke and left
A shroud of steam surrounded me
And I was borne away
I found myself at Sparrows Point
With a slingshot in my hand.

Standing there around me
Two thousand idle hands
Their heads bowed low, their hopes not high
Their hearts weaned of their homes
Their pockets full of photographs
Their eyes full of goodbyes
I took my place among my kind
And I held my place in line

Now I'm twenty one and well-employed
I send home most of my pay
Which leaves plenty left for cigarrettes
To help me pass the days
With beloved friends surrounding me
The cold streets so far away
Three days west of Normandy
A rifle in my hand.",Sparrow's Point

I dreamed of you again
This time you seemed so real
Winking back at me

I feel your ghost again
When I thought you'd gone for real
I'd never say for good

Not I catch my breath and wait
Wide-eyed and half awake

Just the wind
Blows through my dreams again
Thought I had closed the window tight
Against the night

Now I catch my breath and wait
Wide-eyed and wide awake

And there is little now that I can say
But that I will always love you
And I'll always miss
And you are always welcome here

They found a uniform about my size
It's a little big I guess, but that's alright

Mama, they're treating me right well
The men all say I brought this good luck spell
I am the mascot of the Third Brigade
They will not march unless I lead the way
Mama, they're treating me right well

Mama, I do not have a gun
I'm only lucky when I'm banging on my drum
But I skinned a rabbit for the cook last night
He said that I could keep his bowie knife
Mama, I do not have a gun

And we must move while we've still got the wind

Before I take that walk
Before my soul flies from this chamber
And heaven beckons me across

To that thief upon the Cross

I come from Palestine
Please excuse these rags I'm in

When I was in my prime
But I gave it up, and all for love
It was his career or mine

Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

A love like this will come but once
This I do believe
And I'll not see his like again
As I live and breath
And I'm sorry if I might offend
But I will never see
How the tenderness I shared with him
Became a heresy

Jesus loved me
This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

But I remember nights we spent
Whispering our creed
Our rituals, our sacraments
The stars our canopy
There beneath an olive tree
We'd offer up our plea
God's creation innocent
His arms surrounding me

Jesus loves me
This I know
But why on earth
Did he ever have to go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off

Richard Shindell,"Once I tried to row
'Cause you know I hate to fly
so I set out from the coast
But got battered by the tide
As I glided back to shore
I raised an angry oar
And cursed that blue divide

As if it weren't enough
To still be stranded on the wrong side
I landed in the surf
When a breaker hit my blind side
And when my clothes had dried
I hung my head and cried
Beside that blue divide

Because all that time I thought
That you and I were lost
A toss long fallen wide
In that blue divide
That endless blue divide

So I climbed up on a dune
And found Marconi with his radio
He was looking kind of blue
His antenna rusted long ago
Sitting on the cliff
We shared a handkerchief
Above that blue divide

I waved it in the hope
That you owned a telescope
That could pierce that blue divide

I thought I was marooned
Til I caught sight of your balloon
Rising with the moon
Across that blue divide
That endless blue divide

When I looked again it was much too late

A glance held long and a stolen kiss
This is how I remember you best

The fool I was is the fool I am
I've got a wife, I'm a family man
But when I lay in our bed
I sometimes dream I'm holding you instead

The kids are fine
They're six and nine
I think you'd probably like my wife
But the kitchen light seems much too bright
For what I find myself thinking tonight

Richard Shindell,"I was proud to be the soldier
I had been since '83
When I joined to pay for college
Like my brothers before me
I was proud to serve my country
And to be a fine Marine
But pride can not protect me
From the things that I have seen

When they shipped us out of Norfolk
My family came to wave
My Mama stood there
Choking back the tears and looking brave
And though we never spoke of it
We all feared it just the same
Now they tell me I should talk about
The things that I have seen

I was trained to take the good shot
I was trained to clean my gun
They trained me not to talk back
And they trained me not to run
I was trained to be as silent
As the shadow of a hawk
But no one trained me for the silence
Of the things that I have seen

Once I saw an accident
Out on Old Rt. 17
Mama told me not to look at it
As we slowly passed the scene
Thought the image of that wreckage
Was burned into my brain
That did not prepare me
For the things that I have seen

I thought I was a good man
I thought I was elite
I thought I'd fight the good fight
And that I'd never see defeat
Then we won that bloody war
And how we laughed at their retreat
Now I wage a losing battle
Against the things that I have seen

Be glad that modern science
Has given us so much
We can rifle through the channels
Without ever standing up
But I can't find a station
That hasn't had enough
Of this morbid fascination
With the things that I have seen
And me, I can't stop dreaming
About the things that I have seen

Richard Shindell,"She wonders if the flags are waving still
She likes to see their colors on the hill
Almost like a rainbow over all of this
She will fly the flag of nowhere

Hidden with the ribbons in her hair
Anywhere she goes, she knows it's always there
Never far away from nowhere

Nowhere is a place inside her head
Though she is not its only citizen
No one knows how many souls there may remain
Carrying a torch for nowhere

Nowhere doesn't have a government
No one can decide how far it may extend
She will not surrender nowhere

So, she is learning how to play the flute
Just because she always wanted to
She practices her lessons every afternoon
Up and down the scales of nowhere
Stumbling across Au Claire de Lune
Hour after hour in her basement room
Making up a tune for nowhere",A Tune for Nowhere
Richard Shindell,"First warm day in all these months
All the sunlight made me  drunk
Made me feel like I could  run
Made me feel like I was  young 
So I went out all on my  own
I told no one where'd I'd go
Anyway I did not  know I only knew I had to  go
Out beyond the iron gate
Out there where you said you'd wait
Gotten used to living here
Call it habit  call it fear
Though I had glanced your way for years
Til today  I'd never dared 
But it was easy slipping through
Easy as the morning dew
That lingers til the afternoon
And rises back into the blue
Out beyond the iron  gate 
Out there where you said  you'd wait

There you were right by my side
Reaching down to lift me  high
I held on with all my  might
Held on to a world made right
Out beyond the iron gate
Out there where you  said you'd wait

I heard voices all around  Someone lifted off the shroud
I saw my children gather  round 
Now I will tell them what I found
Out beyond the iron gate
Out there where you  said you'd wait",Beyond the Iron Gate
Richard Shindell,"I saw my youth today
He passed me on the street
As he walked by I stood frozen

Behind these cold unyielding stones

Do you remember when
We used to play a hundred games?

And is your mother well?

And if she should ask you why
Why you could say just for no reason

Remember that old troll
Who lived inside the tree?
He was never dangerous
That's just the way it seemed

The day you climbed the tree
And ran to show me how
The troll was never seen again
So where could he be now?

Don't you know this face?
Do you remember when
I used to let you win the races?

Richard Shindell,"It's the middle of the night
Near the Indiana line
I'm pulling in a Christian station
The signal's crystal clear
But I cannot really hear
What he says about the Revelation
I am wretched, I am tired
But the preacher is on fire
And I wish I could believe

Whoever watches over all these truckers
Show a little mercy for a weary sinner
And deliver me ' Lord, deliver me
Deliver me to the next best western

Did he who made the lamb
Put the tremble in the hand
That reaches out to take me quarter
I look him in the eye
But there isn't any time
Just time enough to pass the tender
The highway takes its toll
The green light flashes go
And it's welcome to Ohio

Richard Shindell,"Must've been in late September 
When last I climbed Reunion Hill 
I fell asleep on Indian Boulder 
And dreamed a dream I will not tell 

I came home as the sun went down 
One eye trained upon the ground 
Even now I find their things 
Glasses, coins, and golden rings 

It's ten years since that ragged army 
Limped across these fields of mine 
I gave them bread, I gave them brandy 
Most of all, I gave them time 

My well is deep, the water pure 
The streams are fed by mountain lakes 
I cleaned the brow of many a soldier 
Dousing for my husband's face 

I won't forget our sad farewell 
And how I ran to climb that hill 
Just to watch him walk across the valley 
And disappear into the trees 

Alone there in a sea of blue 
It circles every afternoon 
A single hawk in God's great sky 
Looking down with God's own eyes
 
He soars above Reunion Hill 
I pray he spiral higher still 
As if from such an altitude 
He might just keep my love in view 

Must've been in late September 
When last I climbed Reunion Hill",Reunion Hill
Richard Shindell,"I had a place in the desert      
Just a roof and four walls
Where I could wait for the rapture
Where I could ride out the fall

I was keeping a virgil
I was deep in a trance
I was holding a candle
To the palm of my hand

Then I saw you smiling then I saw you smiling 
Then I saw you smiling
Like a fool I protested
I need time to prepare

You see I never expected
Something so simple and clear
So I tried to persude you
That I was not what you thought

That I would only disappoint you
That I can't be what I'm not

You stood there smiling                  
You stood there smiling
You stood there smiling     

I looked around for a reference
But there was none I could see
Is there a thread to the sequence
That brought this vision to me

There are larks in the morning
Tracing lines to the lake
Three dimensions of mercy
Three dimensions of grace

You just stand there smiling
You just stand there smiling
You just stand there smiling",Smiling

You will offer up to June

Maybe will be certain
You can take it as a vow

At the blooming in your yard
And evry opening flower will be a mirror
Of the quickening in your heart

I come from Palestine
Please excuse these rags I'm in
But I've fallen on hard times
But long ago I had my work
When I was in my prime
But I gave it up, and all for love
It was his career or mine

This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

A love like this will come but once
This I do believe
And I'll not see his like again
As I live and breathe
And I'm sorry if I migh offend
But I will never see
How the tenderness I shared with him
Became a heresy

This I know
But why on earth
Did I ever let him go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off
With this heart of mine

But I remember nights we spent
Whispering our creed
Our rituals, our sacraments
The stars our canopy
There beneath an olive tree
We'd offer up our plea
God's creation innocent
His arms surrounding me

Jesus loves me
This I know
But why on earth
Did he ever have to go
He was always faithful
He was always kind
But he walked off

Sandy, the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight

Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July

Down in town the circuit's full of switchblade lovers, so fast, so shiny, so sharp

As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark

And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore

Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever

Oh, love me tonight, for I may never see you again

Hey, Sandy girl... my baby


Now the greasers, they tramp the streets or get busted for sleepin' on the beach all night

Them boys in their high heels, ah Sandy, their skins are so white

And me, I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades, bangin' them pleasure machines

Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk, where they all promised to unsnap their jeans

And you know that Tilt-a-Whirl down on the south beach drag? I got on it last night and my shirt got caught

And it kept me spinnin', they didn't think I'd ever get off


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life on the water

Runnin', laughin' underneath the boardwalk with the boss's daughter

I remember, Sandy girl... my baby


Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me

I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore

She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio

Kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of the cheap little seaside bars, and I saw her parked with her lover boy out on the Kokomo

Did you hear, the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do?

For me this carnival life's through-- you ought to quit this scene too


Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us

Those pier lights, our carnival life forever

Oh, love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever

Oh, I mean it, Sandy girl

Richard Shindell,"The merge from the turnpike was murder, but it's never a cinch
It was Friday at five, and no one was giving an inch
They squeezed and the edged and they glared
Half them clearly impaired by rage or exhaustion
The rest were just touchy as hell

Somewhere near Paterson everything slowed to a crawl
The all-news station was thanking someone for the call
It's a van from St. Agnes's choir
There's a nun out there changing a tire
By the time they got by her, tempers were out of control

So they all hit the gas in a dash for position
Bobing and weaving and flashing their highbeams
Fliping the bird and screaming obscenities
A well-insured hoard hell-bent on Saturday

And so they continued west-bound and into the sun
Law and decorum constraining nary a one
By then it was devil-may-care
Not one even vaguely aware
That they had come all the way to the Delaware Water Gap

But how had it happened? They had all missed their exits
How had it happened? Was it some kind of vortex?
And in they all went, bumper to bumper
Faster and faster, no sign of a trooper
In they all went, like sheep to the slaughter
Bankers and carpenters, doctors and lawyers
And in they all went, families in minivans
Ashcroft republicans, weekend militiamen
They followed the river, and rounded the bend
Between minsi and tammany and into their destiny
Lying in ambush right their before them
The angry old sun right on the horizon

Sister Maria tightened the bolts of the spare
She said a quick prayer and put the old van into gear
Thank God that the traffic was light
If she hurried she might not be late
For that evening's performance at the state penetentiary

She entered the common room and their was her choir
Altos and baritones, basses and tenors
Car thieves and crack dealers, mobsters and murderers
Husbands and sons, fathers and brothers
And so it began in glorious harmony
Softly and Tenderly - calling for you and me
With the interstate whining way off in the distance
And the sun going down through the bars of the prison
They poured out their souls, they poured out their memories
They poured out their hopes for what's left of eternity
To sister Maria - her soul like a prism
For the light of forgiveness on all of their faces",Transit

Island life does have its charms

The constant sun, the steady breeze

Nothing ever happens here

Few are those who do not fall beneath the spell


It?s language is an orphan branch

But one that I can understand

Its cadence is familiar

It shares the old declension from the continent


I came here with a package deal

Everything all prearranged

Three nights at the Grand Hotel

Where all the rooms have ocean views


By latitude and longitude

Mariners will not arrive

Its coordinates are plotted

By its relative position to the rising sea


The lucky few who call it home

Are prosperous and confident

And they manifest a certainty

That, come what may, things will not be otherwise


(Chorus)


But time is on the ocean?s side

The beaches shift, the cliffs erode

Though the engineers do what they can

Everyday another house just slides away

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Ever since I need you like flowers need the dew
Now my loving heart bows to fate in surrender
And forever more I love you

While your lips to mine with rapture are pressing
And so now by my side you will stay
And hour already is my greatest blessing

Richard Tauber,"One day when we were young
That wonderful morning in May
You told me you loved me
When we were young one day

Sweet songs of spring were sung
And music was never so gay
You told me you loved me
When we were young one day

You told me you loved me
And held me close to your heart
We laughed then, we cried then
Then came the ti-ime to part

When songs of spring are sung
Remember that morning in May
Remember you loved me
When we were young one day

We laughed then, we cried then
Then came the ti-ime to par-art

Remember you loved me

Richard Tauber,"When day is done 
And shadows fall 
I dream of you! 
 
When day is done 
I think of all 
The joys we knew! 
 
That yearning, returning, 
To hold you in my arms, 
Won't go love, I know love, 
Without you, night has lost it's charms! 
 
When day is done 
And grass is wet 
With twilight's dew, 
My lonely heart is sinking 
With the sun! 
 
Although I miss your tender kiss 
The whole day through, 
I miss you most of all 
When day is done! 
 
Although I miss your tender kiss 
The whole day through, 
I miss you most of all 
When day is done!",Whan Day Is Done
Richard Tauber,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine
Richard Tauber,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Never an honest word

Richard Tauber,"I have heard all you've been saying
Yet I will love in my own way

Lonely as a desert breeze
I may wonder where I please
Yet I keep on longing
Just to rest a while

Where a sweetheart's tender eyes
Take the place of sand and skies
All the World forgotten
In one Woman's smile

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally
The one my worshiping soul possesses

At her call, I'd give my all
All my life and all my love enduring
This would be a magic World to me
If she were mine alone

I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally

It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

Richard Thompson,"She was there one minute
And then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself
With a twisted neck

Oh, she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life
She used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance
The chosen would dance in attendance

She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?

Oh, she used to have style
She used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad when
The truth came 'round and she refused it

They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note

I rolled and I roared 'til I couldn't see your face

Do you go on the prowl while other folks slumber?
Did you steal those things right off of the line?

Richard Thompson,"I packed my rags, went down the hill
Left my dependents a-lying still
Just as the dawn was rising up
I was making good speed
I left a letter lying on the bed

A girl could feel special on any such like.""
Says James, to Red Molly, ""My hat's off to you.
It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952.

And I've seen you on the corners and cafes, it seems.
Red hair and black leather, my favorite color scheme.""
And he pulled her on behind,
And down to Boxhill,

They'd Ride.
Says James, to Red Molly, ""Here's a ring for your right hand.
But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man;
For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen.

I've robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine.
And now I'm twenty-one years, I might make twenty-two.
And I don't mind dyin' but for the love of you.
But if fate should break my stride, then I'll give you my Vincent, To Ride.""

""Come down Red Molly,"" called Sargent McQuade.
""For they've taken young James Aidee for Armed Robbery.
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside.
Oh, come down, Red Molly, to his dying bedside.""

When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left.
He was runnin' out of road. He was runnin' out of breath.
But he smiled, to see her cry.
And said, ""I'll give you my Vincent.
To Ride.""

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a '52 Vincent and a Redheaded girl.
Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.
Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52.""

Well he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys.
He said, ""I've got no further use...for these.
I see Angels on Ariels in leather and chrome,
Swoopin' down from Heaven to carry me home.""

And he gave her one last kiss and died.
And he gave her his Vincent.

Richard Thompson,"I was nineteen when I came to town
They called in the Summer of Love
They were burningbabies, burning flags
The Hawks against the Doves

I took a job in the STeamie
Down on Cauldrum Street
I fell in love with a laundry girl
Was working next to me

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Brown hair zig-zag round her face
And a look of half-surprise
Like a fox caught in the headlights
There was an animal in her eyes

She said, young man, O can't you see
I'm not the factory kind
If you don't take me out of here
I'll surely lose my miind

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We busked around the market towns
And picked fruit down in Kent
And we could tinker lamps and pots
And knives wherever we went

And I said that we might settle down
Get a few acres dug
Fire burning in the hearth
And babies on the rug

She said O man, you foolish man
It surely sounds like hell
You might be lord of half the world
You'll not own me as well

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We was camping down the Gower one time
The work was pretty good
She thought we shouldn't wait for frost
And I thought maybe we should

We were drinking more in those days
And tempers reached a pitch
Like a fool I let her run
With the rambling itch

Last I hear she's sleeping out
Back on Derby beat
White Horse in her hip pocket
And a wolfhound at her feet

And they say she even marriend once
A man named Romany Brown
But even a Gypsy caravan
Was too much settliing down

And they say her flower is faded now
Hard weather and hard booze
But maybe that's just hte price you pay
For the chains you refuse

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
And I missher more than ever words could say
If I could just taste
All of her wildness now
If I could hold her in my arms today
Then I wouldn't want her any other way",Beeswing
Richard Thompson,"Let me rock you in my arms
I'll hold you safe and small
A refugee from the Seraphim
In your rich girl rags and all

Did your dreams die young
Were they too hard won
Did you reach too high and fall
And there is no rest

For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all
Your eyes seem from a different face
They've seen that much that soon

Your cheek too cold, too pale to shine
Like an old and waning moon
And there is no peace
No true release

No secret place to crawl
And there is no rest
For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all

If tears unshed could heal your heat
If words unsaid could sway
Then watch you melt into the night
With Adieu, and rue the day

Did your dreams die young
Were they too hard won
Did you reach too high and fall
And there is no rest

For the ones God blessed
And he blessed you best of all",King of Bohemia

Shoot out the lights. Shoot out the lights

Keep the blind down on the window
Ah, keep the pain on the inside
Just watching the dark. Just watching the dark
Ah he might laugh but you won't see him
As he thunders through the night
Shoot out the lights. Shoot out the lights

In the darkness the shadows move
In the darkness the game is real

It wasn't for me

When she touched me a lump rose up in my throat
But she must act that way with any old soak
And waiter, you don't seem to share in the joke
So I'll be taking my business elsewhere

Boldly she kissed me
I'll never get over

Acting that way
And I'm healing okay

It's cold in the rain

And it's dark and it's sad
And I'll miss her tonight

Richard Thompson,"Well, I bought me a horse with a broken leg
They said that she never could win
""Only fit for a bullet"", they said
She’ll be coming out of a tin

So I took her home, I fed her on hay
I tied her up with a sling
Well, she just kept howling all of the night
And that’s the reason I sing

Well, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

I took her to the race-track one fine day
They couldn’t believe their eyes
They said, if that nag even stays on her feet
We’re gonna give you first prize

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name
Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name
Both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

She ran so fast that it took my breath
You never did see such a win
But when she crossed that finishing line
I was just too tired to grin

Ah, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name
Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning
I never will sleep again

Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning
That’s how she got her name

Richard Thompson,"By Devonside she was a-marching
It was a gang of no great size
And surrender was the banner that she carried
And hungry was the shiver in her eyes

She met a boy, his health was failing
She dropped the banner and took her prize
And the only food she had was bread and morphine
Ah, but he fed on the shiver in her eyes

By Devonside his love was drifting
He looked for comfort otherwise
And there never was a rope or chain about him
Ah, she held him with the shiver in her eyes

Ah, she said, my John, I'll be your pillow
I'll be your lover, mother, whore and wife
And he knew that he loved and never seen her
When the light fell from the shiver in her eyes",Devonside
Richard Thompson,"Well I wove the rope and I picked the spot
Well I struck out my neck and I tightened the knot
O stranger, stranger, I'm near out of time
You stretch out your hand, I stretched out mine

O maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just the hand of kindness
Maybe just a hand, stranger 
Will you reach me in time in time

Well I scuppered the ship and I bent the rail
Well, I cut the brakes and I ripped the sail
And they called me a Jonah, it's a sin I survived
Well, you stretched out your hand, I stretched out mine

Maybe just the hand of kindness
Well, maybe just the hand of kindness
O maybe just a hand, stranger

Richard Thompson,"Oh, you took my word and you took my key
You took my pride and you took my dignity
How can I still pretend
To be what a man should be

Well, whatever I say is in a book
Whatever I do there’s someone there to look
You just can’t shake a man
The way that I’ve been shook

Now is this the way it’s supposed to be
Is this the way it’s supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

Oh, is this the way it’s supposed to be
Is this the way it’s supposed to be

Oh, see that lifer doing his time
If I could have his place and he’d have mine
We’d be no better off
On either side of the line

Well, you took my job and you put me to sleep
You feed me money, you treat me like a creep
Wish I could get away
But I must be in it too deep

Tell me is this the way it’s supposed to be

Oh, is this the way it’s supposed to be
Is this the way it’s supposed to be

Well, you tell me you’re going to get in touch
You send me a letter that reads like double Dutch
You say, you’re bound to lose
You’re a little such and such

You got my number, you got my rank
You drained my head, you drained my petrol tank
And when I die of shame
I won’t even know who to thank

Now, now, is this the way it’s supposed to be

Richard Thompson,"""Get in the car"", she said and drive me into next week
I should have turned her down, blame my curious streak
I never dreamt that we’d be driving into trouble
Until we hit a rock that bent my nose double

I’d say we both were on run, run, run
She looked too fresh for twenty-one, one, one
She slipped her little hand in mine, mine, mine
Said, ""I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine, whine
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine""

Ah, the wheels were moaning, we were heading ninety-five
The rain was beating down, my engine was alive
The roads were empty as the day turned into night
With every street lamp her face shone white

I asked her name and she just smiled, smiled, smiled
We must have clocked a thousand miles, miles, miles
She said, ""We’ll be there in a while, while, while""
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine, whine
I’ll take you where the wind don’t whine

I was feeling weary when the car died on me
I pulled her over and the strength just drained from me
The price of running’s getting dearer and dearer
And nothing ever seems to get nearer and nearer

I suppose I didn’t make the grade, grade, grade
When I looked around she’d slipped away, ‘way, ‘way
Out in the night you’ll see her shine, shine, shine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine, whine
Waiting where the wind don’t whine

",Where the Wind Don't Whine
Richard Thompson,"Don't think my love is something that you can play with
I'm not the one to spend the time of day with
You learn to hide love, you lock it up or find it gone

But you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
Oh you're listening to the wrong heartbeat
You're listening to the wrong heartbeat
My love is strong

If you should see a tear, you won't see many
If you should hear me sigh, it's not for any
If you should greet me as I am walking along
You only want to see just the shell of me
You don't know the other part

Don't throw your secrets where men will steal them
You got to hide them, you got to seal them
No matter what you try, you'll never take my love from me

Richard Thompson,"Well, I left my home down on the rural route
I told my paw, ""I'm going steppin' out
And get the honky tonk blues"", yeah, the honky tonk blues
Well Lord, I got 'em, I got the honky tonk blues

Well, I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes
Woke up this mornin' wishin' I could lose them
Jumpin' honky tonk blues, yeah, the honky tonk blues

Well, I stopped into every place in town

I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
And scat right back to my pappy's farm
And leave these honky tonk blues, yeah, the honky tonk blues

Richard Thompson,"We used to say that come the day
We'd all be making songs
Or finding better words
These ideas never lasted long

The way is up along the road
The air is growing thin
Too many friends who tried
Blown off this mountain with the wind

[Chorus]
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge
When my time is up I'm gonna see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're gonna meet on the ledge

Yet now I see I'm all alone
But that's the only way to be
You'll have your chance again
Then you can do the work for me

Richard Thompson,"I stepped on the dance floor feeling very cool
I thought I saw an angel sitting on a stool
I just couldn’t tell, you’ll think I’m a fool
If she was a woman or a man

She was the kind of woman that a man could crave
From her high-heeled shoes to her permanent wave
Except maybe she was needing a shave
Was she a woman or a man?

I asked her to dance and I took her by the hand
She held me so tight, it was hard for me to stand
Built like a lumberjack, I couldn’t understand
If she was a woman or a man

Well, I walked her home at a quarter past four
My heart was thumping as we ducked in the door
And then when she kissed me I thought I was sure
If she was a woman or a man

She stole my wallet and she knocked me off my feet
She tied on her roller skates and made her retreat
All I found was a blond wig lying in the street
Was she a woman or a man?

Well, I don’t care if she seemed unkind
She stole my heart and she robbed me blind
I love her so much that I still wouldn’t mind
If she was a woman or a man

",Woman or a Man?
Richard Thompson,"When I was a boy
I was nobody's joy
I was guilty in love

So shine on love
Shine, shine, shine on love

Don't slip away

Now we go together so shine on love

And I'm standing on that rock

And the girls were all pretty
And a uniform was a lucky charm,

Once in a blue moon you might find a job
Sleep in the rain, you sleep in the snow
When the beds are all taken 
You've got nowhere to go

Well I can see me now, 
I'm back there on the dance floor
Oh with a blonde on me arm, red-head to spare
Spit on my shoes and shine in me hair

We'll handle this on our own
Yankee go home

Dow Jones going into a stall
Spray paint saying it on every wall
The climb was fine, now it's time to decline and fall

Overpaid, oversexed and over here
Get smart, gringo, disappear
The Hun's at the gates of Rome
Yankee go home

Another day on earth is flown

Will the pubs never close? Will the glass never drain?
No more DTs and no shakes and no horrors
The very next morning, you feel right as rain

'Cause God loves a drunk, lowest of men
Like the dogs in the street and the pigs in the pen
But a drunk's only trying to get free of his body
And soar like an eagle high up there in heaven
His shouts and his curses they are just hymns and praises
To kick-start his mind now and then
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Does God really care for your life in the suburbs?
Your dull little life full of dull little things
And bring up the babies to be just like daddy
And maybe I'll be there when he gives out the wings

But God loves a drunk, although he's a fool
Oh he wets in his pants and he falls off his stool
And he can't hear the insults, and whispers go by him
As he leans in the doorway and he sings sally racket
He can't feel the cold rain beat down on his body
And soak through his clothes to the skin
O God loves a drunk, come raise up your glasses, amen

Will there be any pen-pushers up there in heaven?
Does crawling and wage-slaving win you God's love?
I pity you worms with your semis and pensions
If you think that'll get you to the kingdom above

Oh God loves a drunk, although he's a clown
Oh you can't help but laugh as he gags and falls down
But he don't give a curse for what people think of him
He screams at his demons alone in the darkness
He's staying alive for just one more pint bottle
Won't you throw him a few pennies, friend?
Ah God loves a drunk, for ever and ever, amen",God Loves a Drunk

Than a junkie in her arm
Strapped her on the bed, 
Seventy volts through her head

We're all giving ourselves free invitation

Ah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party

There was Monks and Eddie, and Weasel and Freddy
There was the gang of four, we beat down the door
Oh we crashed the party

The fence was electric, the dogs were mean
It was just like Stalag 17
When we rung on the bell they come for the business
So we got while the getting was good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night

Oh, we crashed the party, yeah, we crashed the party
It would have been a sin if we didn't get in
So we crashed the party

We did the alligator and the mashed potato
Oh, we cracked some heads and broke some hearts
Oh we crashed the party

We got in the cellar, or just about
We got right in but we couldn't get out
Weasel got stuck in the bathroom window
And pushing didn't do any good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party
You gotta put up a fight on a Saturday night
So we crashed the party

Well we got on the roof of the house next door
Jumped down twenty nine feet to the floor
Landed in the arms of an amazon queen
Dancing with her Johnny Be Good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party

 A sailor's life, it is a merry life.
 He robs young girls of their hearts' delight,
 Leaving them behind to weep and mourn,
 They never know when they will return.
 
 Well, there's four and twenty all in a row
 My true love he makes the finest show.
 He's proper tall, genteel and all,
 And if I don't have him, I'll have none at all.
 
 Oh father, build for me a bonny boat,
 That on the wide ocean I may float
 And every Queen's ship that we pass by,
 There I'll enquire for my sailor boy
 
 They had not sailed long on the deep
 When a Queen's ship they chanced to meet.
 ""You sailors all, pray tell me true,
 Does my sweet William sail among your crew?""
 
 ""Oh no, fair maiden, he is not here
 For he's been drownded we greatly fear
 On yon green island as we passed it by,
 There we lost sight of your sailor boy.""
 
 Well, she wrung her hands and she tore her hair.
 She was like a young girl in great despair.
 And her little boat against a rock did run.

Richard Thompson,"This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
I need you at the dimming of the day

You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confident

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night we steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day

The time has come to travel 
But the road is filled with fear

And I'm bent and grey with years
And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me 
Against my dying day
I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow,
You'll win the lover's prize

She wrecked the furniture, she wrecked my heart
She danced on my head like Arthur Murray

Just when I thought I could learn to forget her

Oh, oh, oh love love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better

Set it all down in a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh love, love
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

Well my head was beating like a song by the Clash
It was writing checks that my body couldn't cash
Got to my kneest, I was reeling and dizzy
I went for the phone but the line was busy

Just when I thought that things would get better
Right through the door come a tear-stained letter
Oh, oh, oh help me please
Cry, cry if it makes you feel better

Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

Cry, cry if it makes you feel better
Set it all down in a tear-stained letter

Well I like coffee and I like tea
But I just don't like this fiddle-di-dee
It makes me nervous, it gives me the hives
Waiting for a kiss from a bunch of fives

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Richard Thompson,"Me name is Sam Jones and it's bones me occupation
Chuck your old hocks out for my consideration
Thirty years a bone man, up and down the nation
Sam Jones deliver them bones

I've been among the shamrock and I've been among the thistle
I like it all picked over, clean as a whistle
No sign of meat on, no sign of gristle
Sam Jones deliver them bones

I've seen battlefields whites with human ivory
Noble Dukes and Princes stripped of flesh and finery
When the crows have done their job, they say, that's the time for me
Sam Jones deliver them bones

And I even dream of bones when I'm lying very ill
Rooms full of skeletons a-dancin' the quadrille
Rows and rows of skulls singin' Blueberry Hill
Sam Jones deliver them bones

And if you're unburied, the likes of me will find you
You're no good to worms but you might become the finest glue
We'll grind you up and spread you out as fertilizer, too
Sam Jones deliver them bones

And I've got a lorry, it's me own bone shaker
Where's there old knuckle joints, I'll be the undertaker
I'll come calling 'round just like the butcher and the baker
Sam Jones deliver them bones

My name is Sam Jones and it's bones me occupation
Chuck your old hocks out for my consideration
Thirty years a bone man, up and down the nation
Sam Jones deliver them bones

Oh, Sam Jones deliver them bones
Sam Jones deliver them bones

Richard Thompson,"Old friend, it's been so long, and it's been so real
And if I helped you once it was no big deal
Too bad, I can't be there when they call your name
They're going to write you down in the hall of fame

You really got to what you wanted, I'm thrilled as pie
It really couldn't happen to a nicer guy

Put it there pal, put it there
Now and then just throw me a crumb
Put it there pal, put it there
Thanks for the help when I needed it, chum

You saw me drowning, you said I was a fake and laughed
Then you jumped right in and used me for a raft

You shot me down with friendly fire
You were all dressed up to play gun for hire
The rope you threw me was made of barbed wire
But put it there pal, put it there, pal, put it there

I know you mean well, call me a sentimental fool
I know sometimes you've got to be kind to be cruel
When you pat me on the back, that was quite some slap
That kind of compliment, it could kill a chap

So I'll drink your health, oh, this emotion's given me a thirst
But maybe, I'll have my food taster, drink it first

Put it there pal, put it there
You deserve everything you got coming
Put it there pal, put it there
Call me up if you want to come slumming

Some say, you're a rattlesnake in the grass
But I say the sun shines out of your arse

So it's no hard feelings, live and let live
With a gift like yours, you're born to give
You're so full of love, it leaks out like a sieve

So put it there, pal, put it there, pal
Put it there, put it there
Put it there, put it there, pal
Put it there, pal, put it there, pal

Comes the catacomb of tongues

Circle in and circle around
He said, she said, she said, he said
Thrill to put the other one down

This time, gone too far
This time, can't heal the scar
I want to break out of this spin
The gravity's pulling me in

What flies straighter than an arrow?
What cuts deeper than a lance?
Your wit may shine on the withering line
Cruelest dance is the razor dance

Some people never learn
If time could crawl back in its shell
And mischievous tongues could untell
But that's not the meaning of hell

She takes a knife to my seatbelt

Say goodbye to dark and damp
DSS will pay your stamp
Last shift, close her down

Leave your manhood, leave your pride
Back there on the mucky side
Take the cage for one more ride
Last shift, close her down

Put the business in the black
And they've stabbed us in the back
With old school ties and little white lies
They left our town for scrap

Golden handshake, sling our hooks
Now we're nursemaids, now we're cooks
Now our kids steal pension books
Last shift, close her down

Now the scrapper boys infest
And the wrecking balls caress
Like vermin round a burial ground
They catch the smell of death

Old Grimey's lost its soul
Fifty million tons of coal
And we're beggars on the dole

But your eyes follow me around
Why can't I get you off my mind?

",We Got To Get Out of This Place
Richard Thompson,"Let's love what's left
Last dance, first breath

New friends hard won
Old hearts shine on

The frost is cruel
And fades the sign
On that little place
That I call mine

Let's love what's left
Like new born, first breath

Old stars, new shine
Old cup, new wine

Sun rise, moon glow
Someday we'll know

Inch by inch
Word by word
The lock is sprung
That caged the bird

Let's love what's left
Last dance, first breath

",First Breath
Richard Thompson,"Among the headstones you played as boys
Crypts and tombs like a roomful of toys
Just up the river from the smoke and the noise
Gethsemane
And there's war-whoops and secret signs in the trees
Estuary smells coming up on the breeze
O perfect endless days like these
O Gethsemane

Sailboat on the Cadie, pushbike on the quay
In your eyes there's fire, in your hand destiny
â??O be something, be something fine!'

Just down the river, into the noise and the smoke
Being daring with the staring, uncaring folk
Who laugh with you, laugh at you, you'll never get the joke
Gethsemane
And they broke your spirit there in the marines
Flushed your head down in the latrines
Frozen in your sacrement, derailed in your teens
Never saw the enemy

And those bosses betrayed, soon let you go
The fire in your eyes, how could they know
â??O be something, be something fine!'

Now you've got your own boys, hell bent for leather
Dead before they're 18, or bitter old men forever
They never saw the halo moon rise over the river
Of Gethsemane
Now there's a pain in your head puts lead in your shoes
Better get it seen to, it's going to be bad news
How did the perfect world get so confused
O Gethsemane

Who sucked out the freedom, days without end
Under the weight of it all you must bend
â??O be something, be something fine!'",Gethsemane
Richard Thompson,"Don’t mind me, friend of a friend
Bent the key to my lost weekend
Don’t mind me, along for the ride
Diz, the gas man says, it’s all right

Tag along
I get a taste of things
Flap my little wings
I’ll tag along

You could be my kind of crowd
A little bit edgy, a little bit loud
I test the water, I feel the heat
Before I jump in with both feet

I’ll tag along
I keep out of your hair
You’ll hardly know I’m there
I’ll tag along

Love those swirly whirly lights
Love that girl with the rips down her tights
Might have to hurl when the Molotov bites
I’ll tag along

I didn’t do it, it wasn’t me
I was at the back, invisible, see?
I’m a 100 per cent and that’s a fact
You can ask Diz, I’ll be right back

I’ll tag along
And get a taste of things
And flap my little wings

Richard Thompson,"O sweet Rosie Lee
Like a sister to me
But you thought I was playing you smart

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

You saw us there dancing
And you thought us romancing
Suspicion has ripped us apart

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

With your interpretation
On my reputation
You blinded yourself to the truth

Then to add some more weight
To your ramblings of late
Well, dear won’t you bring us some proof?

How you cursed and you cried
As you locked me outside
You said I was bad from the start

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

Oh, I knew when we met
You’d never forget
Each pothole and bump in the road

And if I left your side
What a blow to your pride
Is you’re mad at me, I suppose

The doubt in me’s growing
And it hurts me just knowing
Another night’s sleep will depart

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

Jealous words
Won’t lie still
In my heart

",Jealous Words
Richard Thompson,"Now I remember the promise I gave you
The night I shipped out as a peace volunteer
As we sat holding hands in the Lamb and Flag tavern
I swore, I’d be back for you same time next year

But I killed a man in a Brazzaville street fight
I tried to hold back, but he taunted me so
5 years till they freed me from that Brazzaville prison
Out of boredom or pity, I never will know

Now I bear the stain
The scar on my name
I never can go back again

There’s a love, you can’t survive
And it burns you up inside

I sailed my boat into New Orleans harbor
Tied up at the jetty, as bold as you please
With a half-ton of Charlie built in to the bulkhead
Right under the noses of all them police

Now here I sit in my house on the mountain
King of the clouds and all I survey
There’s women who are willing, and the law can’t touch me
Yours is the one face that won’t go away

",A Love You Can't Survive
Richard Thompson,"One door opens, another shuts behind
One sun sets and another sun she rises
Love comes to you in old familiar ways
Love comes to you in shadows and disguises

She may quit you, she may forsake you
Drift away like a phantom in a fever
Who walks in to your heart of solitude
Who walks into the lair of the deceiver

They say it was my turn
They say I had it coming
They say that’s what you earn
For living through a lie

If I could have my way
I’d leave it all tomorrow
There’s sorrow if I stay
I’ve other fish to fry

When love breaks like a precious string of pearls
A thousand memories, they roll away and scatter
Make believe that there’s ice runs through my veins
Shrug my shoulders as if it doesn’t matter

",One Door Opens
Richard Thompson,"God never listened to Charlie Parker
Charlie Parker lived in vain
Blasphemer, womanizer
Let a needle numb his brain
Wash away his monkey music
Damn his demons, damn his pain

What do we need Physics for'
Heresy's his inspiration
Corrupt and rotten to the core
Curse his devious mathematics
Curse his deadly atom war

Adding to the background noise

Richard Thompson,"Is this the togetherness, she meant so rosy
I thought we'd share a continent so cosy
I thought love's passions really
Would be more touchy feely

She said it was destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there?

She said it was in the stars
Something that just had to be
But Venus aligned with Mars
Always really takes it out of me

Oh, I'm not proud of my deceit, you know that
To come so near and then retreat, you know that
One beat before I fell
Somewhere I heard a bell ring, ring

She said it was destiny
She said it was written somewhere
But if it was destiny
Why am I over here and she's over there?

There's clouds across my crystal ball, too misty
Was I too quick to give it all when she kissed me?
She's thrown a net on me, razor wire geometry

She said it was destiny

She wrecked the furniture, she wrecked my heart
She danced on my head like Arthur Murray

Right through the door come a tear-stained letter

It was writing cheques that my body couldn't cash
Got to my feet, I was reeling and dizzy
I went for the 'phone but the line was busy

But I just don't like this fiddle-di-dee

Waiting for a kiss from a bunch of fives

Richard Thompson,"Strolling down on Mutton Street
The moon is peeping through
Old wives say, young man, you'd better
Watch your P's and Q's

Life is good on Mutton Street
If you know the why and where
Romping on the bomb sites
There's magic everywhere

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

We came upon those Burley boys
They were shaking like a leaf
We had our stones and dusters
We were armed right to the teeth

We fired a friendly volley
And we only maimed a few
And quick as greasy lightning
They disappeared from view

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

Now, bonfire night it was a sight
The bonfire, how it blazed
Nearly set the street alight
So they called the fire brigade

The fire brigade got busy
But we cut the hoses clean
And suddenly the Mutton Boys
Were nowhere to be seen

we're the boys of Mutton Street
Mutton Street, Mutton Street
We're the boys of Mutton Street
We give no ground

we're the boys of Mutton Street

Shell shocked fusilier
Tip him a little drink, he?ll get you

Got soda pop and news
Scott and Son?s got toys for boys
But they push their Christian views

Oh, will she keep me for idle games?

I know her touch, what her touch would mean

And did you come so far

Richard Thompson,"He was a species on the verge of extinction
She was an Air New Zealand hostess
They were mystically joined like Rawicz and Landauer
Like Pinky and Perky, like Porgy and Bess

Oh, he loved the pursuit and the romance
But the details were more of a chore
When the bride's veil lifted, his mind soon drifted
At least that's what happened before

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

Oh, she loved the clinking of glasses
When the toast was to nobles and princes
In the conjugal nest she was seen at her best
With her keen eye for curtains and chintzes

And she had all of the furniture ordered
By the time they were naming the date
And her mother came speeding from distant Dunedin
To help with the flowers and cake

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

At the Chapel of Partial Remembrance
The ushers went into a seizure
Mr. Bacchus, they said, ""Should we stand on our heads
Would sackcloth and ashes displease you?""

And they honeymooned down in Ibiza
Where the sun and the nightlife were hot
As she lay on the sand, he said, ""Isn't it grand?
I bring all of my wives to this spot""

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

A life of volcanic activity
Left him nothing to spout but hot air
A long interruption since his last eruption
Was disguised by sheer devil may care

But some charm and some skill, and manoeuvre
Had him rising to meet the occasion
And for once they found bliss but news of their tryst
Got to Fleet Street and caused a sensation

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

The Press was baying for blood now
They gave them a week at the most
We were all glad to see it reach weeks two and three
But the fourth week, the whole thing was toast

And she dragged her tail back to New Zealand
With threats of High Court and revenge
Meanwhile his eye did stray to the ample bustier
Of a novelty dancer from Penge

Let it blow, let it snow
Let the mercury bubble and dive
Life's little traumas and courtroom dramas
Remind me I'm glad I'm alive

That I'm sorry to not be in touch
It?s been quite a parade, but my thoughts never strayed
Too far, or too long, or too much

Miss Patsy, forgive all the choices I made
I've been fighting shadows on the wrong crusade
Looking for ghosts in a penny arcade
Miss Patsy, no more will I roam
Miss Patsy, won't you carry me home?

They held me to ransom back there in the foothills
And nobody stumped up a bean
Not Swifty, nor Eddie, came up with the ready
It can make you think people plain mean

I've been hanging out with some virtuous people
They emptied my bank account twice
They gave me self-confidence, even some clothes
And a truckload of love and advice

When they gave out the cyanide pills with a wink
And said, ""Wait for the word, any day now, we think""
I knew it was time to pull back from the brink
Miss Patsy, no more will I roam
Miss Patsy, won't you carry me home?

Miss Patsy, I looked at myself in the mirror
Decided I needed some work
Got me a nose job, a shave and a haircut
To drive all them ladies berserk

But the arm 'round my waist was a man in dark blue
He said, ""ain't you him? we've been looking for you""
Now I'm sharing a cell with a holy kung fu

That I swear there's no beauty before you
And those that deny or think that I lie

That's why, she?ll take a gin or three
To drive doubts from her head

While she's working hard enough
With housework, kids, and all that stuff
You're out there with some bit of fluff

Nice not to have to try too much

A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

A life of small horizons
Dull as the governmental sky over North West Eleven

A serious hobby in the garden shed
Model trains or soldiers in lead
Join the suburban boffins of Britain
Experts on trivial things

And holidays in the Yorkshire Dales
Or cycling tours of the North of Wales
Unenvious of those flea bitten
On continental flings

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

Excitement comes by subtle means
The satisfaction of routines
Small revenges at the office
Smug little victories

You work on your pallor, complexion like paste
Like the gray defeat on an inmates face
A life spent adding losses and profits
Resigning by degrees

A solitary life
A life of small horizons
Dull as the governmental sky over North West Eleven

And come to the end, sad and alone
A steady reliable tumor you've grown
From selfish years, while all your peers
Have stressfully jogged to health

In life you always were quite numb
And foggier now, you soon succumb
In drab St. Barts on the new by-pass
Death overcomes by stealth

A life of small horizons
Dull as the pewter skies over North West Eleven

Richard Thompson,"All he ever wanted to do was harm
All he ever wanted to be was cruel
At 12 years old, fate marked his brow
And he said, ""I have a mission now""

But we laughed at his clothes
And the blackheads 'round his nose
When we were boys at school

Teachers spoke of Hannibal and Hector
Nimrod and Nietzsche were more his fuel
Swastikas and pentagrams
Flourished from his tender hands

But we watched in the rain
As the bully beat him up again
When we were boys at school

And he said, ""My camouflage will hide me
I'll be gray as the world is gray
Turn a thousand government corridors
Behind which of a thousand doors
Will I delegate and rule, oh, little boys at school""

All he ever wanted to do was harm
All he ever wanted to be was cruel
And sometimes when the night is still
I can feel the gatherin' of his will

I can feel him flex the strings of power
And grope to his appointed hour
But we laughed at the dirt
And the frayed cuffs on his shirt

And struck down the raven through the heart o

And the cold earth did wonder and startle
O where is the raven that I struck down dead
And here did lie on the ground o
I see that my true love with a wound so red
Where her lover's heart it did pound o

And talks to the night and the day o
But his eyes they are sane and his speech it is plain
And he longs to be far away o

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Richard Thompson,"One thing always leads to another
In life and love they say.
You got too close and now
That boy's gonna make you rue the day.
You grab his ankles when he flies,
Catch him when he falls.
Here's the thing to say to him
Before you climb the walls:

Said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
One day you're up, next day you're down,
Why do you monkey my heart around?
Said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.

I see your nerves are jangled, honey,
You're a walking emotional wreck.
He's dealing you some jokers
Off the bottom of the deck.
He goes from joy to suicide
About 15 times a day.
Here's the thing to scream out loud
From 100 miles away.

Said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
One day you're up, next day you're down,
Why do you monkey my heart around?
I said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.

Where's the joy in a boy who dribbles
When he drinks his tea.
I've seen better manners from
A baby chimpanzee.
On fairground rides you grip the sides,
And scream until you're blue.
You'll be screaming the rest of your life
If he gets hold with you.

Said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
One day you're up next day you're down,
Why do you monkey my heart around?
I said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.

Shame, shame, shame,
Shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
One day you're up next day you're down,
Why do you monkey my heart around?
I said shame, shame on you, you Bad Monkey!
I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.
I said I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.
No, no, no,
I'm not comin' on the roller coaster with you.

Vultures pecking the eyes out of his head
Another day that could have been me there instead

I might get home if I can live through today
Before I came out here I never used to pray

It's someone else's mess that I didn't choose
At least we're winning on the Fox evening news
Nobody loves me here

Dawn patrol went out and didn't come back
Hug the wire and pray like I told you, mac
Or they'll be shoveling bits of you into a sack

Dad's gonna kill me.

And who's that stranger walking in my dreams
And whose that stranger cast a shadow 'cross my heart
And who's that stranger, I dare speak his name
Must be old death a-walking
Must be old death a-walking

Standing waiting for the sandbox to blow
Sitting targets in the wild west show

She eclipsed the sun and the moon
All that summer my feet never walked on the earth

When her thoughts were some other place
All that summer my feet never walked on the earth

She sang angels to rest

How do you fall when you already fell for the best

She had that look in her eyes
Like she'd seen a ghost in the sky

How do you love when your heart isn't well

Richard Thompson,"Once there was a son
Among the gorse, among the grey
And wondrous dreams he spun
Among the gorse, among the grey
And he chased the clouds and
He kissed the wind
Barefoot and bloody at the knee
It is, he said,
As if the world were made for me

And the elders gathered round
Among the gorse, among the grey
And they staked him to the ground
Among the gorse, among the grey
And they sucked the joy
From his beating heart
Washed his eyes with rue
Now come, they said,
Come to the world we made for you","Among the Gorse, Among the Grey"

All the lorry drivers thought he was a laugh
They didn't know the truth, they didn't know the half

Sidney Wells he had a lovely line in chat
Before a girl could think he'd have her at his flat
Dansette playing soft, a gin'll do no harm
No one could resist Sidney Wells' charm

Cheryl was a waitress at the works canteen
Older than she looked, she'd pass for 17
Too pretty to be working such a lousy job

At Hennessy and Sons he dropped his heavy load
Cheryl checked her makeup, looked up at the clock
She had a date with Sidney at the loading dock

He led her to the woods, the sky was getting dark
She thought it was romantic, thought it was a lark
Buried in her mind there rang a small alarm
But no one could resist Sidney Wells' charm

Then he took off her clothes and threw them in a pile
He watched her stand there cold and shivering for a while
Then he picked up her stocking lying on the floor
And wrapped it round her neck until she breathed no more

He tried to burn the body, he didn't do it well
Up on a pile of tires, it was an awful smell
They found her poor remains and summoned the bereft
And took her to the church to bury what was left

Now Sidney Wells he was a heartless kind of rake
The blood within his veins was colder than a snake
He didn't run, he carried on just like before
Until the CID came knocking at the door

The judge said, Mr Wells, the evidence is strong
Said Wells, ""I'll not deny, what took you all so long?
All you see is victims, all I see is brides
I'm guilty to the gills, and 7 more besides.""

One way or another, I'm happy your aim was so true
If the demons in you hadn't jarred
I would never have struggled so hard
The only thing now eating me is, what's eating you?

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
Oh my enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy

My enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy
Oh my enemy, enemy
How I need my enemy

Now we're just two old men on the brink
Each waiting for the other to blink
If I should lose you, I'd be left with nothing but fate
As I see your life fall apart
I should smile but I don't have the heart
At the end of the day, it's still too much effort to hate

How I need my enemy
Oh my enemy, enemy

Through the blind

And I'm aching
For the night
I left behind

Morning after
Bass drum beating
In my head
Sunday papers
Talking scandal
And a cold
Side of the bed

For I left
A weeping willow

Lying on my pillow
If I wasn't
Such a hard nose
Such a perfect
Waste of time

And it's all
In black and white
I do better
When I'm dreaming
Better than
I did last night

Though the rain
Is pelting down
There's a train goes
Back to London
Hate to leave

Pale and rare and footloose
Will the joys that tempt me
Soon turn and kick and stab

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground

I must take some measure
To pursue my treasure
Guided by confusion
My compass through the storm

But if I call her sister
Manfully resist her
Believe my own illusion
Or will passions warm

In the dream I am running
Down a street of molasses
In the dream my feet gain no ground

If I call her lover
Will I soon discover
That her eye is taken
By some fawning friend

Then my glass would shatter
And my mind would scatter
Being so mistaken
The world must end

Fell for the widow from across the street

Poking his nose where it don't belong

I’m going to eat till the pot runs dry

Dirty water fit for kings and princes

You show you care in other ways

If I don’t stop strumming my guitar and get out of my room
If I don’t get a life she’s going to look elsewhere

Time ain't nothing but time, 
I now have no fear of my fears
And no more tears to cry,

I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

Shining from, the cloudless sky, it lights her way.

With darkness gone, like a distant road
We travelled all nigh until the morning rose.

Now we're turning, towards the sun, unfolding everyday
From out behind, the clouded mind,
With more than words to say.

We're half-naked souls and a harmony
Is a song of tears, all washed into the sea,
As we stand along the shoreline.

We were cut off from our lives, by a wall of pain,
It can't be seen, it's so routine, it has no face or name.

But now the day has broken, can see in better ways,
A path leading to the light, a hope that never fades.
All power to the brave.

See how, they kindle fire, illuminate her face.

Richard Wright,"A part of herself, she thought love was dying, 
The game of opposites, a hateful lie. 
She can't hang on at all, she's giving up the fight. 
She's locked in a wall of ice, 
Through half the day and half the night 
On a path that's been prescribed. 

Nothing comes, but she can't leave her life 
Or hear the falling rain, or the heart race in her. 
And dark as it grows at night, with fear of light's change 
She's drowning away 
In what she can do and what she contains 
And her heart it so low. 

Now, because I could not cope with the pain, 
How things are not the same, she's got no remedies. 
A heartbreaking fall and I fear a change of course 
I feel like we were born insane, 
I hear the love, I fear the love 

For the heart is low, see how it grows apart. 
And deep from the other side, we live so plain 
We have no night, we have no day, we have no falling rain.

It's another world, it's a better world that we bring

And freezing cold. 

But sooner than woke up 
To find it all unchanged 
I'll sleep through the day til the daylight ends. 
'Cause it's all so familiar 
As it comes around again

With morning I rise,

You're sad, naked and pale 

And you're reaching for the rail 

You took a look inside, how could you peel away 
Or break the shell, the hurt you've hidden so well 
For all your days. 

And you're going down 
As you slip beneath the waves, 
Won't make a sound 
Won't even leave a trace before you. 

I hear an appalling sigh from the streets below 
And it's creeping fear congealed in stone 
That paves the crazy road. 
And all are succumbing and they look so hopelessly 
At the heartbreak, it's easy to deal with, 
Just take these and you'll really never feel it.",Reaching for the Rail

I've got a never ending love for you
From now on, that's all I want to do
From the first time we met, I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love to you

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Richie Cole,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings

Richie Cole,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head

She thinks she's in Spain
She isn't in love
She's merely insane

It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas

Keep away from her

Modest and pure
Polite and refined
Well-bred and mature

Should be organized to honor me

Richie Cole,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams

A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

Hey ho, alas, and also lackaday.
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.

I go to ball games  the bleachers are fine. 
I follow Winchell and read every line:

I like a prize fight that isn't a fake. 
I love the rowing on Central park lake. 
I go to opera and stay wide awake:

I like the green grass under my shoes, what can I lose? 
I'm flat! That's that! I'm all alone when I lower my lamp

I don't like flying  I'm glad I'm alive. 
I crave affection but not when I drive:

Richie Havens,"In the dawning, wakening hour
He'll lift his head and brush his eyes with gentle strokes
That will only blindly mislead him
Into the first day of creation which he only sees in limitation

Now he sits upon his empty bed
His heart is warm, his heart is full and he can see
But it is impossible for him to retain me
For his arms are without form, he cannot know the word
As his mind cries out absurd

Now he's standing inside the doorway
He is afraid but he believes all that he sees on the floor
Where everything is merging
And pictures he sees are tragic as he begins to believe in magic

Now he lies down in a hole
Down in the ground where it is cold and now he knows
Now he realizes his biggest mistake
That he never had to grow old, and he never had to grow cold and die

Let your hands tie a knot across the table.

And close your fingertips and fly where I can't hold you
Let the sun-rain fall and let the dewy clouds enfold you

If all the things you feel ain't what they seem.

And close your eyes, child, and listen to what I'll tell you
Follow in the darkest night the sounds that may impel you
And the song that I am singing may disturb or serve to quellyou

And fill our lungs with seas of life.
Come taste and smell the waters of our time.

And close your lips, child, so softly I might kiss you,
Let your flower perfume out and let the winds caress you.
As I walk through the garden, I am hoping I don't miss you

And we'll see them soon through days and nights
But now silver leaves are mirrors, bring delights.
And the colours of your eyes are fiery bright,
While darkness blinds the skies with all its light.
Come see where your eyes cannot see.

And close your eyes, child, and look at what I'll show you;
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes blow you,
And maybe when we meet then suddenly I will know you.
If all the things you see ain

Oh Lord, gonna die blues

Now I had a woman
Lord, she lived down by the mine
She ain't never seen the sun
Oh Lord, never stopped trying

Then one day my woman up and died
Lord, she up and died now
Oh Lord, she up and died now
She wanted to fly
And the only way to fly is die, die, die

There's a high flyin' bird, flying way up in the sky
And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by
Well, she's flying so freely in the sky

Lord, look at me here
I'm rooted like a tree here
Got those sit-down, can't cry
Oh, Lord, gonna die blues

Morning, morning 
Feel so lonesome in the morning 
Morning, morning 
Morning brings me grief 

Sunshine, sunshine, 
Sunshine left upon my face 
And the secret of the shining 
Puts me in my running place 

Evening, evening 
Feel so lonesome in the evening 
Evening, evening 
Evening brings me grief 

Moonshine, moonshine 
Moonshine dots the hills with grace 
And the glory of the shining 
Seems to break my simple pace 

Nighttime, nighttime 
Feel so lonesome in the nighttime 
Nighttime, nighttime 
Does not bring me to relief 

Starshine, starshine 
Chills the moon upon my cheek 
Starshine, starshine 
Darling kiss me as I leave

Richie Havens,"I got the blues from my baby 
Down by the San Francisco bay,
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad, 
She was the best girl I ever have had,
She said goodbye, 
I can take a cry, 
I want to lay right down and die

I ain't got a nickel 
And I ain't got a lousy dime
If she don't come back, 
I think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay, 
It's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay

Sitting down looking from my back door,
Wondering which way to go,
The woman I'm so crazy about, 
She don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train, 
'Cause I'm feeling blue,
And ride all the way to the end of the line, 
Thinking only of you

Meanwhile, in another city,
Just about to go insane,
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, 
The way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay, 
It's going to be another brand new day,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay,
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco bay",San Francisco Bay Blues

Richie Havens,"The countryside was cold and still
There were three crosses upon the hill
Each one wore a burning hood
To hide its rotten heart of wood

And I cried
Father I hear the iron sound
Hoofbeats on the frozen ground

Down from the hills the riders came
Lord, it was a crying shame
To see the blood upon their whips
And hear the snarling of their lips

And I cried 
Mother I feel a stabbing pain
Blood flows down like a summer rain

Each one wore a mask of white
To hide his cruel face from sight
and each one sucked a hungery breath
Out of the empty lungs of death

And I cried
Sister raise my bloody head
It's so lonesome to be dead

He is a devil and not a man
For underneath that white disguise
I have looked into his eyes

On your way down
There's nobody left to crown

Oh Lord don't we wish they were
We would not be so dependent
On courts of laws that make us all feel like defendants sometimes
If we want freedom we've got to amend it

Be it ever so humble
There's no place like home
Homeâ?¦home on the range
Where the fear and the antidotes play
Where seldom is heard 
An encouraging word
And our leaders do nothing all day

What if they gave an election
And nobody came to vote
The system it needs a bit of correction
Just might seem like changing direction right now
As it stands we don't even make the selections
And to get into Heaven we even need a connection

It was told a million times though it need not be told twice. 

A soldier came down from Diem Ben Phu, with silence in his eyes. 
He told of many an evening when fire was the sky. 
He told of many a morning when the bravest of men would cry, 
Knowing, through Satan's earthbound magic, many more would have to die, 
Many more would have to die.

Where we might end up on the corner

You can hurt him until he dies
You can kill him until he never asks you why
You're on his land, you're on his land

And that can only lead to blame
Where we might end up for our country

You can trample on your sister
You can hurt her only if she cries
You can hurt her only if she cares
With all her heart, with all her heart

But we all know she'd be a mother
And that could only lead to shame
Where she might end up for her children
Taking handouts in the rain

Teach your children stories
You can fill them full of lies
You can make them all despise

Down by the hollow
Its waters deep

Thousands come
And millions follow
All to see
What they could see

Now some see light

Some see might
And some see flow

Deep down in silence
As they pass the booth

Who cannot hear me
I call to those
Who hear as well
And those I touch
When they come near me

You see faces you've never seen before

You realize

We dangle on a string
And make believe that everything is real

Lost in a trance
They make us all dance alone
And that's the way it is

Stand against the wind
Crying in the rain
Let the games begin

Pain is always, pain is always pain
We will let time tell us
That that's the way it is

Do you believe
That with just one little smile
This whole world

Has changed a thousand times
Yet in a breeze
This whole world can be gone

But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change till you change

Your goin' out tonight been up two days
Your dead inside but your still awake
You walk around and everybody's tellin' you beautiful
And your doin' it all thinkin'

Everything is gonna change
But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change
Till you change so far away from your home
No voice of reason completely alone
You know your shadow won't keep you warm

Everything is gonna change
But life ain't gonna wait you can fight it but you know it
Never will change ain't nothin' gonna change till you change",Change
Richie Kotzen,"When I met you we were the best of friends
Spent every night together in my bed
No lie at one time I thought that you were good for me
You drove a benz and a jag too but when the money quit so
Did you
So fast to take the cash

Gold digger suck it down go get that money
Go on shake it baby Shake it baby
Gold digger sell it out you spent all mine and I thank

You

You got my little baby girl tellin' her things that are
Wrong
But its right for you so its cool
To tell her that I'm not her real daddy
I'm lookin' back I had the hundreds stacked
Career move always in the black and you gave me nothing
Back

Gold digger suck it down go get that money
Go on shake it baby Shake it baby
Gold digger sell it out you spent all mine and I thank",Gold Digger
Richie Kotzen,"Turn out the light, our story is ending
We wore this thing so far down I can't tell what I'm talking about
Take what you want, this old love is empty
And I don't have anything here that I can't live without

You say your spirits gone, I can't say that your wrong
Oh, I know we tried, we came into it strong
Maybe we stayed in too long, woman, let's say goodbye

Tell me a lie so I can believe
There's more than this moment to moment passing us by
Look in my eyes and I'll know it's over
And I will go on from right here with the rest of my life

You say your spirits gone, I can't say that your wrong
Oh, I know we tried, we came into it strong
Maybe we stayed in too long, woman, let's say goodbye
I can take a loss I will move on, say goodbye, yeah, ooh
Let's say goodbye

Oh, you said that I will never leave you
I said, ""I think you're crazy""
You said, ""I would never leave you""
I said, ""I think you're crazy""
You said that I would never leave you
And I said, ""I think you're crazy""

Rapid transit, be moving too fast 
You better get up off your ass 
It`s possible that this here is your last chance 
The non stopper, the lil rhyme dropper 
To step the I.N.S crew is improper
 
We loom spots, terrorists hiding behind shadows 
And the darkness Insolence crew desperado 
I`m the last Prince of Babylon 
Hell fire washed out with water
 
[Chorus: ]
You better get up, you better stand up, `cause 
If you can`t then you wind up in a world of shit 
You better get up, you better stand up, `cause 
If you can`t then you wind up in a world of shit
You better get up, you better stand up, `cause 
If you can`t then you wind up in a world of shit 

Yo ma it`s time for you to stand up kid... 
Well I don`t care what you all heard 
`Cause I will be on a terrorist mission 
To rule the whole world 
Siphon sight through sound 
Smoking by the pound 
I sniffed more gina than a blood hound
 
Don`t like the way I look then don't stare 
You don't like my attitude, I don't care 
If you step on my shoes, you`re gonna surely lose 
Into your soul I will tear 


Fists in the air, a rugged world that's not fair 
Want to ask the tough question 
Let`s play truth or dare 
Got a style that's unique, victory no defeat 
World wide conquest, my mission 
Your pain will be sweet 
Your crew can`t test so praise the Don Dada [Repeat 4X]

Hardcore mastery verbally spitfire 
One hit quitter tapestry with barbwire 
Palms get burned when you lay your hands down 
Terrorism hits `em once my squad lands down 
I never lie, I never lie but when i stand accused 
I deny, I deny can`t take the heat repeat 
And it gets a little hotter

Richie Kotzen,"I can read your mind 
Don't you know it's easy for me after all this time 
And I know when you lie 
If were talking on the phone or one on one
The truth you never hide

I don't need you to teel me there's something wrong
Because your eyes give you away
I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you go, so before you leave
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember
That I still love you

All the things I thought I'd never see
Have now come to be
You said our love was strong
I said that we belong
But somehow I lost you suddenly

I can't seem to forget about you being gone
'cause your eyes are unmistakeable
I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you gone, so before you leave
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember
That I still love you

I can't seem to get my head around you
Being gone

So before you gone, so before you leave
Listen to me , listen
Remember, remember, remember
That your heart's not unbreakable
Remember, remember, remember

You got me lost and I've stopped believing
In you
I was used and abused by you and I can't

Believe it
Five years the best of my life to
Show me
Your so cold how did I ever let you get me

Your sol cold how did I ever let you get to me
Blind to the web you wrapped me in
Deaf to the lies your spinning
I'm just a fool that believed in you

But now I'm faithless
A broken heart and a scarred mind
That what you left me",So Cold
Richie Kotzen,"You said to me I'm not what your looking for
Your movin' on somebody else can give you more
So I let you go thinking will never meet again
But here you are and baby I wanna know

Did you wanna be rich did you wanna feel special
Did you wonder in all this time how I
Was livin' without you
Did you wanna be cruel did you think that I never would go on
Now all the things you thought you had have gone
Let that be a lesson to you

Its funny how life can change
You never know until you walk away
I see you now and your lost and afraid
Because you know had love
And you wanted more

I give your more than I ever got back
You left me here to forget about that
Have gone
Let that be a lesson to you

Your special your so special your so special to me
All things that you wanted now you know were wrong
You gave up love for something more let that be a lesson to you",Special

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

It's all right (to touch myself)
I said it's alright (to touch myself)
I don't think it?s wrong to touch yourself
Ain't nothin wrong with making it feel good

Baby it's been awhile since my lovin 
And I wanted to know if you missed me 
Since last November you were my contender
And then you played another girl in December

Why do you treat me like you do
Go away and play me a fool
I just want to get close to you
But now all I'm going to do is

A little ecstacy never heart nobody

When I was hugging it, niggas couldn't do nothing with it
Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time
Homey, we make a great combination don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it y'all, y'all niggas playing basic ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the drop with the AC on
That's why the, streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool!

Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime (ha ha!)
Cause I got, shit to lose, a nigga out here payin his dues
My baby walking gotta get him some shoes

Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gasket clicked
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like on box-spring
Pissy Mack and shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads
Slanging loose quarters, this Philly cat back gatted (had it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts
Still busting with that black-matic

You ain't a buck or four 
You sold your tv for a buck

Lined on a youngsters quip 
Got to think your sick 
To representing your click 
But you're a old school 
Thinking too much hype 
Yo, buy some timmy on right, it got, *eeehhh* rally strike!

No money and ball, down to pussy, dick, and alcohol 

Picture me rollin' (what) corny hoes get they holes dug 

I might show 'em thug passion but I'll never show 'em love 

Can't hit me in combat, relentless when I ride 

Strategize on my enemies, plottin' till they die 

Ask me why I'm high, and my reply ""Till the day I die"" 

Don't want to picture this cold world through sober eyes

Connect with the spirits of fallen homies and bustas, then we ride 

surprise niggas when they seen us, they duck down

Uh, I hope the town still love me 
For some reason and my deceasing and my zoot's ain't fluffy 
I need a pillow 

Chorus: DeWayne Wiggins 

Lay a drop on the pillow (Yeah baby) 
And just relax, relax, relax (Cos that was made for you) 
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby) 
I'll fly free sack (fly free sack), fly free sack 
(Cos that was dove for you) 

Verse 2: Rame Royal 

By chance it might seem strange, many nights I dream 
of trees on the range with branches of light green 
Women slumbering get tossed like salad with cucumber 
but can't stop me from gettin lost on the lands of broccoli 
High! I shut em, close my eyes, cough, too much spirit goes 
The cloud nine where I'm a lyrical wiz 
Magical like Willow wit automatic flowin pillows 
Get rolled in a bliz and consumed, that's how Rame Royal is 
In my room at the villo, sun shines through blue blinds 
on the window, lettin me know it's time 
to go back to reality 
Oakland, Cali 
And a sack of indo left on the bed 
next to my rizzy's head 
Fulfillin wishes, I'm fillin phillies, Vegas and swishes 
wit twenty reefers, sticky weed - minty and delicious 
All I need and can axe for, a twamp to crunch 
Probably won't want another blunt til lunch 

Chorus 

Verse 3: Richie Rich 

Fell through Sophia's but didn't see her 
Now I'm convinced that it's on when I fall through this red fence 
I shoulda flipped the whole thang when I had the chance 
but that done broke my back like a bald bozack 
On a late night, I lurk for sure and got a lot of dough 
for the first cat with the platinum sacks 
And, naw, it ain't a jack, you can hold my scraps 
but pull a move and catch a lump to the back behind the scak 
Richie Rich might walk a country mile, smilin all the way long 
Wit dreams of pullin bongs, writin bomb songs 
Buzzin with my cousin at the villo 
stressin off a pillow 

Chorus: DeWayne Wiggins 

Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby) 
And just relax, (just) relax, relax 
(I know, I know, I know the sack was one for you!) 
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby) 
I'll fly free sack, (fly free sack), fly free sack 
(I know this sack was wrong for you) 

Yeah ba-by! 
Oooh yeah 
Here we are gettin night endeavour 
Don't worry 'cause it's gonna get better 
I roll a fat one for you, yeah 
Break it down 'cause it ain't no startin 
Put a drop on the every bodin 
And I'll blow a pillow with you

Way hate me, or should I say hate on me
Why do brothers bump they gums and debate on me
Why when I ride by and don't stop
You feel I disrespected your block

If you had a top-notch lezbo, straight from Peanuts
Sexin', tell me would you hit it without protection, uh uh
Let's make it harder, what if she had a friend
Both down for nut huggin, off the Hen, would you spend

Chips, what if I come off the hoe with six-six
Will I get back in the mix, drop some grip, or just quit
What if O.J. verdict was different thing
Would we swing, start lootin' and shootin' with Rodney King

If it was a fifth, would you share it with ya folks
So we could ride out and get smoked
I wonder if I dropped a hundred dollars would you give it back (no)
I wonder if we cool like that (hell no)

[Chorus]

You got three cute flees, one fine, one got a job, one with patience
What would you dick for a long term relation
Money is the thing, fine ones can start hatin
I'm broke so I need one with patience

If I was hella dirty, look like Mr. Furley, 
With lint up in my curly hair
Would you groupie-ass girlies stare
What if I didn't have a car to skee-skirt in
Would you still be flirtin' or would it be curtains

If you got your teeth knocked out, would you re-freak the old ones
Or rush to the dentist for some gold ones
If you had forty dollars, and a hooker wanted thirty
Could we catch you out in Vegas doin' dirty

If you got one gritty and five niggas
Would you speak on the choo-choo shit to make the situation bigger
She'll do it, but now she on some new shit
You gotta go down town, enjoy the fluid

[Chorus]

How many blunts must I take to the face to be straight, forty
If I don't got five on the eighth would you fake or, smoke it
Get loaded or hold it like a buster to get cluster
Should I be rollin' with big hustlers

Would I take one and a heisteses
Want to bubble, but you can't keep up with the prices

And then I ask you, what if I sold a million plus
Should I renegotiate with that nigga Russ

[Chorus]",Questions

He be movin' things for like thirteen point six
Try to tell his nigga how he hatin' the game
Let's get them driver numbers, eighteen a thing

Found him in the hills with a dick in his mouth

Smelly muthafucka, sto' filled with nats
Never woulda thought he had the gats
Made his ass a offer at a thousand a bird

Whatchu know about that? Ahhhh...
All bad bitches, lock windows
lock doors
Fake pimps lock hoes
Niggas with diet game too late stole clothes
Real bitches fuck with deez and not those
When I'm at the club and they pop the doze
Nigga keep ya eyes open, watch the hoes
Could it be the walk foo? 
The shoes, or the clothes?
Or maybe they be bound to the game i throw
Its the raspy, genuine, into mine
When I'm on the field keep him on the sideline
That soft shit you spit, it ain't tight
I never known the hoes to bite on game light
'cause it ain't right
To slide through in S Fish
Lauren's a dish and deals with the best bitch
Trick I shoots this
Like Marcus Ray-Boy
I bring it to life 'cause I'm a true playboy nigga...

See Rich pimp hoes in tennis shoes and gym clothes
But I'll boot a bitch
Who got ass like she's black
Love to fuck me, Bruce Lee sucky-sucky
Now I run hoes of all nationalities
And when I'm in the zone
Her breasts might be silicone
Might catch me on the stroll with a bad bitch
I'm checkin' loot
Nigga listen to the game I shoot
When I'm out alone
I seem to knock straight hoes
Be on the lo-lo
But niggas screamin dat's they hoe
You come and get this bitch
'cause double-are got more
And what I do
My stable stays stuffed like glew
I put my vocal on it
And call me raspy nigga
9 hoes, fine hoes
Don't even ask me nigga
I ace 'em up
My shoes, my bitches, lace 'em up

here's a map, for the want to-be's
The game pick up niggas
Stick away quick
Why push 19s, when I could slip on dubs
And check this
Once or twice a day switch fits
Be a heat packer
Safe from the street jackers
I rock ice
The type of cat to hit a block twice
Call up once, sac run up, baby no fronts
Smoke blunts
Only let her hit the light once
Compare
So damn different than a playa
The first one
He be the worst one
Bitches to the left
Me and my cat Hew Hef
Play me
Ya lose the L and pay me in ?? toes
that's the type of shit I tell hoes
Prefer puppies
That drown in the game like guppies
Now they swimmin
Straight lakes, born to chase women
Play it slow
My lifestyle's smoother than Trojan nigga

Richie Sambora,"The lightning flashed as angels
Rode fiery chargers through the clouds
That answer scared me into tears
And all the grownups laughed out loud

Now the years roll on, tired voices have all gone
Now they ride their thunder through the heavens

There's a world in every drop of rain
Embracing oceans sweep us home again
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, you shall not find another lie

They say for every living thing
There's a guide up in the sky
That helps you pass from world to world
So you never really die

Then with scythe and cloak
Death comes waltzing to your side
As the visions pass you ask
If there was meaning to your life
As you strain to hear the answer, spirits sing, and devils fiddle
As he bends to whisper in your hear, he leaves you one more riddle

Oh, the answer lies beyond the pain
All the questions in our minds, we surely ask in vain
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, and you shall find another life

And now my life is like a storm
Growing stronger every day
Like the unrelenting wind
That comes to blow our lives away
So I live each day like I know it's my last
If there is no future there must be no past

Now I know the answers never meant a thing
And with each instant that I breathe
I feel the joy that life can bring
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, you shall not find another lie
Come along with me, come along with me
Seek the truth, you shall not find another lie",The Answer

Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
So look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
Don't waste your time away
Thinkin' 'bout yesterday's blues

Born outta passion
To a world gone cold
Ya wear it on your shoulders
It's a heavy, heavy load I know
Love and its emotions
Come knocking at your door
Young hearts will be broken
And time's the only cure

Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
So look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
Don't waste your time away

Temptation makes us fall from grace
But the angels were sinners
And the sinners saints
Forgive yourself cause we're all the same
Everybody rides on the karma train

Better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
Look in your mirror
It'll tell you the truth
Don't waste your time away
Don't waste your life away, no, no

A bright light burning 
For every broken heart in this world tonight

Richie Sambora,"The old man down on the corner 
Is drowning in his pain 
I can see the sorrow in his eyes 
His tears, they leave a stain 
The streets have left him broken 
He's in the final phase 
It's been a long hard road 
From his glory days 
There's a tattoo of his sweetheart 
Fading on his arm 
He talks of painful tragedy 
How he lost his lucky charm 
His memory is clouded 
From the thunder in his vein 
He's vanishing, vanishing gone 
In the Harlem rain 

Harlem rain coming down 
Another shattered soul 
In the lost and found 
One more night 
On the street of pain 
Getting washed away by the Harlem rain 

On desperation avenue 
The devil takes his tall 
Where the pushers and the poverty 
Slowly claim your soul 
When you reached the realization 
That you just can't break the chain, no 
You're vanishing, vanishing gone 
In the Harlem rain 

Harlem rain coming down 
Another shattered soul 
In the lost and found 
One more night 
On the street of pain 
Getting washed away by the Harlem rain

In your search for tender mercy 
No one seemed to care 
The faith that used to be your crutch 
Is now your cross to bear 

You lost yourself so long ago 
You don't know who to blame

Forever winding
Where it leads us I don't know
In it together
For better or worse
Searchin' for our pot of gold

Time leaves a trail of broken hearts
So many arrows just keep missing
Their mark - but baby that ain't us

Nothin' else matters if you're in it for love
Together we can only go higher
We can reach any rainbow that we're
Dreamin' of
Nothin' else matters at all 
When you're in it for love

We'll share in the laughter
We'll share in the tears
In the promises we keep
Life can be crazy

Love can be cruel
But it's always been a two way street
You try to give it all you have to give
So many people don't know how to forgive
But baby that ain't us

Richie Sambora,"Made in America, nineteen fifty nine, 
Born down by the factories, cross the Jersey City line. 
Raised on radio, just a jukebox kid, 
I was alright.
Just a small town homeboy, with big dreams, 
Following his conscience, in a world full of extremes. 
Fresh outta high school, only seventeen, 
I was alright.
Blinded by my vision, there was just no turning back, 
Like a runaway train, life was steaming down the track.
You'd say I'd never made it out, but I kept on hanging on, 
Every night I prayed to Jesus, and held my head up strong.
I was alright, I landed on my feet, 
Made in America, I was brought up on the street. 
My old man's independence, seemed good enough for me, 
I was made in America, made in America.
Never cared much about politics,'til I was twenty one, 
But I woke up when Lennon, found the wrong end of a gun. 
He left his inspiration, before he said goodbye, 
And we were alright.
We all lose our innocence, it's impossible to hold, 
I didn't know it then, I had a pocket full of gold. 
When I kissed those younger days goodbye, it almost broke my heart, 
I was going through my growing pains, I was driving in the dark.
But I was alright, I landed on my feet, 
Made in America, I was brought up on the street. 
I'm facing up to freedom, and chasing down my dream, 
I was made in America, yeah I was made in America.
Yeah we all lose our innocence, it's impossible to hold, 
I just didn't know it then, I had a pocket full of gold.
When they said I'd never make it, I just kept hanging on, 
And every night I prayed to Jesus, and I held my head up strong.
And I was alright, I landed on my feet, 
Made in America, I was brought up on the street. 
Facing up to who I am, chasing down my dream, 
I was made in America, yeah I was made in America.

Richie Sambora,"She was standing at the station 
Small town suitcase in her hand 
There were dreams she found inside her 
That no one cared to understand 
She never talks about her childhood 
So much past to leave behind 
She's so scared to go 
But still she says goodbye 
When you walk on that road 
You walk alone 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
When your only hope 
Is to find a home 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
The great unknown 

Born and raised in poverty 
Daddy died when he was young 
All the fears that raged inside him 
His spirit needs to overcome 
Each day he tears down the reflection 
Of who he used to be 
And with a little luck 
He'll rise eventually 

When you walk that road 
When you walk alone 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
When your only hope 
Is to find a home 
Just an undiscovered soul 
In the great unknown 
The great unknown 

In the search of our salvation 
Relentlessly we climb 
Just looking for a reason 
In creation's grand design 
If patience is a virtue 
Then let us humbly begin 
We'll be here waiting 
'Til our ship comes sailing in

When you walk alone

Is to find a home

When the road took a crooked turn.

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?

Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

Richie Stephens,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I get the blues most every night

Richie Stephens,"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

I sure know, and she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know",Maniac
Richie Stephens,"I pretend that I'm glad you went away
But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside and nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside and nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get, you could ask my heart
Just like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still
The night are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had
And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me

Richie Zellon,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water

I'm caught in a cross-fire
from the miles that we spend apart,
The road to our happiness
is the trust in our hearts.
It's hard not to cry sometimes,
when the thoughts run through my mind
It cuts like a knife,
without you in my life.

Refrain
After all the pain we've been through
After all the lies, I'm still in love with you
After all.

I sit all alone here
With a vision of you in my mind
The feelings locked in my heart,
Your key will open up in time.
I think of the love that we shared
When I gaze into your eyes.
Back on track again,
Our destinies collide.

Refrain

If we can't work it out,
Our lives would be through
We're gonna make it right
Just between me and you

",After All
Richrath,"

My heart is left unguarded for you
My mind is lost inside without you
I've seen a million faces
Chased a million dreams
But now that I'm here forever,
What does that mean?

My heart's on fire.

I lie awake all night just thinkin'
How to make this damn thing work through
The good times turned to bad
And all the tears that we shed
But now that I'm here forever,
What does that mean?

Refrain
My heart's on fire
Can it really be you?
You've set my heart on fire
It finally happened to me & you.
My heart's on fire

I never met a woman
Who made me feel like Holly would
She wrapped her arms around me
And made me feel like nobody could
She'd do the things that nobody else would
She'd do the things that nobody else could

I left her arms
in the deep heat of the summer
That decision that I made then
Forever makes me wonder
I'll always love being misunderstood
But still she loves, like nobody else could

CHORUS
Holly would, she'd do the things
that make my heart sing
Holly would, I found heaven with Holly.

My eyes are open,
the woman I love is gone
She left these arms that loved her
and the years have proved me wrong
She'd do the things that nobody else would
She'd do the things that nobody else could

Whoa, whoa, whoa that's the way you do it,
Making money with your charms
Out on the street
You're no good doin' wrong

Refrain
Where were you? Where are you going?
All that you could ever be
You've spent a long time running from me
Clipped your wings 'cause you're flyin' high
Committed murder by suicide
Committed murder by suicide

Whoa, whoa, whoa that's the way you want it
All that fortune with all that fame
Out on the boulevard
Your life's not a game.

Where were you? Where are you going?
All that you could wanna be
You spent a long time running from me
Clipped your wings, 'cause you fly too high
Committed murder by suicide.

Repeat first verse.
Refrain 
",Murder by Suicide
Richrath,"Back when our hearts were young
We danced to a native drum
We'd wait and wait til the midnight coming
I'd hear the window rattle,
and I knew it was time for battle
The boys are here and
we're back in the saddle.

Oh, we made history those nights
We were the outlaws,
that made all wrongs right
But how I missed the mysteries of the night
Oh, where are my outlaws tonight?

We were once the chosen few
But now I know our time is through
All through the years we lost
Our dreams out the window

But now my heart's alive and new
And I've found a new gang, too
We're the cowboys that rise
through the shadows.

Repeat chorus (3)

Oh, we made history those nights
We are the outlaws, and made all wrongs right
But how I miss the mysteries of the night
Oh, where are my outlaws tonight?

Richrath,"The words you said today
I hope it'll go away
Oh Lord, they just can't be true
Even though I'm still in love with you,
Today.
Still in love with you, today.

I never wanted our love to be
A faded, old memory
So baby, where did I do you wrong,
To tear my heart out of this song?
Today...
Still in love with you, today.

Refrain
Looking back at our memories
Shattered dreams is all they'll be
There's nothing left for you to say
So don't go away, today

Richrath,"You know the truth
It's written on your face
Nothing left to do
You're one step closer
to puttin' me away
I gave you all I have
What a high price to pay.

Chorus:
I'm driving into my own tears
Can't stop what my heart fears
The end is near for you and me
It's a tragedy.

You broke the rules now
then threw 'em all away
I've everything to lose now
We're one step closer
Blood on the tracks
I'm going under
There's no turning back.

Chorus

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
There's nothing more left of us
You've dug a hole and buried me
It's a tragedy.

There was a time when
our hearts beat together
Even though we had nothing, we had it all
I thought this love would last forever
But the higher we climb, the harder we fall.

Richrath," got your call just the other day
You say you're leaving,
You can't live your life this way.
All those rumors,
they just can't be true, no
Even though, I wanna believe in you.

Refrain
In all of my life, I've never loved this way
From the moment we touched,
it must have been heaven-made
I want you back, and I'm here to stay
In your heart is where I pray.

You say you've found another,
but your mind's on me, yeah
Can't escape our paths of destiny
You can run, but you cannot hide, no
You can never change your feelings,
inside.

E na rádio que ela escuta tô fazendo promoção
Tá valendo qualquer coisa pra chamar sua atenção

O meu nome o nome dela uma flecha e um coração
Sei que tudo isso é brega, brega todo mundo é

I think about losing

Every time I think of you

Every night out on the floor
I keep thinking maybe tomorrow

Yet it comes and goes like a wave of a stranger

We're caught in a web of lies
Is nothin' worth a damn without the danger

We're lost in a world of illusive dreams
Where every story has a desperate ring

We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And though sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best

We could see the light unfold right before our eyes
Blinded by the tears, we get lost in the shadows
Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain

We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And though sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love
And without pause or regret, searching only for the best

Oh! But the heart is a wondrous thing
Surviving the thunder, outlasting the rain

We got a right to happiness, in the name of love
And may be sometimes we may forget
To give it all we possess
We gotta try for what we get, in the name of love

And without pause or regret
Searching only for the best
Try name of love,
Try in the name of love

I saw them time after time

I saw you there
I know it sounds insane

I needed your smile to bring it all back to me
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here

I just know when you're near

This must be heaven
Have I found it what I've been looking for
This must be heaven
Have I finally stumbled through the door

How could I have doubted
I guess I must have lost my place
You turned on the light
And I saw my life
Reflected in your face

Once in my life I found a joy like this

For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again, again

I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough
To be a man that someone can depend on
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love

As the days go by I see that it's so easy
To do what I want, say what I want
Do what I want, say what I want

To do what I want, say what I want, do what I want
And only once in my life I may find a joy like this

Someone called me just the other day
I thought it was you, but my hopes were washed away
I picked up the telephone, it sent a shiver down my spine
I wanted to hear your voice, and talk about old times

(Chorus)
Remember the days when we walked
The times that we talked for hours and hours
Remember the way it used to be, just you and me
Remember the days

Think it over what I say
I know it could be just like it used to be
Do you believe it baby, do you share my point of view
You know that I mean it baby, and all you have to do is

(Repeat chorus)

What can I do without you, how can I live without you
The day's gonna come, when I'm on the run
So I'm begging you baby please
Remember the days

(Repeat chorus)

What can I do without you, how can I live without you
So come on girl I'm begging you please
Come on and talk to me

The times that we walked
The days that we used to walk out in the park
Remember how it used to be
Do you remember, do you remember how good it used to be

Come on girl, I said come on girl

To the left, to the right, we're gonna rock all night

Do you believe it what the papers say?
They're driving me insane they push me over my limit
Do you believe it they catch me every time?
It ought to be a crime. Wo, the things they say

There ought to be a reason for turning black to white
Sometimes get the feeling that it's done to spite
They don't need a reason to turn your world around

(Chorus)
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm just about done with it all

Do you believe it, when politicians talk
And make, make the people walk into the fire
Do, you concede, is there no reprieve
From their power game, I know there's someone to blame

We ought to be forgiven for taking in their words
They don't even write them now is that absurd
They don't need a reason to tear your world apart

(Repeat chorus)

And I'm just about done with it all

With it all

And I'm waiting, you know I'm waiting
For the angels to sing for the freedom it brings
For the bad man to fall
When the children call, I want the angels to sing
And I'm just about done with it all

And I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I want the children to sing
And I'm waiting for the bad man to fall
I'm done with it all

Convince me she's fine.
But when she leaves I'm not so sure.
It's always the same.
She's playing her game.
And when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me? 
I know she's not as strong as she seems.

Why don't I see her cry for help? 
Why don't I feel her cry for help? 
Why don't I hear her cry for help? 

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all.
The rain on my face,
It covers the trace
Of all the tears I'd had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions? 
Why must we never break down and cry? 

All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.

No need to feel ashamed. release the pain. cry for help.

Rick Astley,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Never Gonna Give You Up [Single/Album Version]

They set the wheels in motion Adam and Eve
The beginning of romance
He was a lonely man I do believe
So he thought he'd take a chance

I know just how he was feeling
He'd been advised not to fall
But when his senses were reeling
That man he wanted it all

Honey this is some kinda love
You are my sweet temptation
Honey this is some kinda some kinda love

Like a moth to a flame all you gotta do is call my name
I'll come running to you
I was a lonely man until you came
Life was black life was blue

Without a word being spoken
I saw you then I knew
Now my defences are broken
There's not a thing I can do

Rick Astley,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The scent of smoldering leaves the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you

How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you so near to me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Rick Astley,"Starry, starry night 
Paint your palette blue and gray 
Look out on a summers day 
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul...

Shadows on the hills 
Sketch the trees and the daffodils 
Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
In colors on the snowy linen land. 

Now I understand 
What you tried to say, to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen; they did not know how 
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
Starry, starry night 

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
Swirling clouds in violet haze 
Reflect in Vincents eyes of china blue 

Colors changing hue 
Morning fields of amber grain 
Weathered faces lined in pain 
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand.
 
Now I understand 
What you tried to say, to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free
 
They would not listen; they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now. 
For they could not love you 
But still, your love was true 
And when no hope was left inside 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life as lovers often do
 
But I could've told you, Vincent 
This world was never meant 
For one as beautiful as you.",Vincent

Rick Astley,"Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
There'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs , with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That everywhere I go I'm never lonely
With you my love, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand-it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there",Where Do I Begin?

I know she's not as strong as she seems.

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

The streets of this town
Trying to find sense of it all.
The rain on my face,
It covers the trace
Of all the tears Id had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.

And so this is Christmas and what have we done
Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun

Rick Culver,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Rick Culver,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Rick Culver,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Rick Culver,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues

I could leave the old days behind

I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains

Rick Culver,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Rick Dakotah,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just a Friend
Rick Danko,"Stopped by a diner, and the blond behind the counter
 Asked if she could help in any way
 I could tell by her smile, her number I could dial
 If I was in the need of company
 I asked her for some Java
 Instead she brought a cup of chickory

A taste of Java is like a volcanic rush
 Nobody's gonna stop me from drinking too much
 Costs many more than you care to pay
 But money is nothin, compared to a fired-up day
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Java Blues... coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee
 Java Blues... well the coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee

You know that I'll stay high
 Drinkin coffee till I die

Won't you boil me water, fill up my cup
 You know it takes a lot to keep me up
 Down in Bolivia, the people are insane
 They want as much for Java as they do for cocaine
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Rick Danko,"So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

When you saw me I was broken
I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, again

You shine across the morning
as I turn to face the east
You told me how to give away
things never meant to keep
Your love is rolling like a wave
that breaks right over me
One hand can hold the ocean
but will never stop the sea

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come
A wave can cut a stone to sand
and the wind can break your bones
I'm wondering how you're doing now
when you are alone

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, once again, once again

He was just a prisoner
Prisoner of your pain
Whose sentence was to serve you
Let you love again
If you go away
He'll still be singing in his chains
Behind the walls of knowing
There was no such thing as blame

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be
The dying's almost easier
Than trying to believe again

Your eyes they are so empty now
So pale in the sun
Your heart it is so weary
From not wanting anyone
With every breath you take
It's for the love that didn't come
Still longing for the day
You thought your life had just begun",Lie With Me

Rick Devin,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left

The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land

Now, don't you cry for me

Rick Devin,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Rick Hollander,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Rick Hollander,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Won't you lead me there?",Skylark
Rick Hollander,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Rick James,"Wow
It's really good to see you again, baby
And I must admit you're looking very, very, very nice these days
I guess life must be treating you well
Oh, me?
Well, I've just been doin' the same ol' thing I've always been doin', you know
I've got a new lady now
And it's a little different then it was when I was with you
You know, I think back to when we met
The way I used to be and the cold way I used to act
But more than that, I think of how you changed me with your love and sensitivity
Remember when I used to

Love them and leave them
That's what I used to do
Use and abuse them
Then I laid eyes on you, it was pain before pleasure
That was my claim to fame
With every measure, baby
Tasted teardrop stains, yeah
I was cold as ice long ago, baby, baby
I wasn't very, very, very nice, you know
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips and you tuned on my fire, baby
And you burned me up within your flame
Took me a little higher
Made me live again, you turned on my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire, baby
Feel it comin' through
And I thank you, baby

Oh, how I thank you, baby
You taught me so much and you showed mw so much and love and insensitivity
That since you've been gone I don't think I've ever felt this way before
You know it's funny how a man can change so quickly from a cold-blooded person
Thinkin' he's God gift to women
Remember how I used to do that?
I must have been crazy then
Remember when you used to

Love them and leave them
Oh, that's what I used to do
Use them and abuse them, whoa
Then I laid eyes on you
It was pain before pleasure
Oh, that was my claim to fame
With every measure
Tasted your teardrop stains, yeah
You were cold as ice long ago baby, baby
I-I wasn't, I-I wasn't very nice, I know, whoo!

Feelin' good to you (feelin' good to you)
You turned on my fire (fire), baby (oh, baby)
And you burned me up within your flame (you burned me, you burned me)
Fire and desire (fire and desire)
And we're both to blame, both to blame

You know
I guess I think we both said a little too much today (no, ooh)
After all, Tee, you're kind of with somebody else
I'm kind of livin' with somebody
But please do me a favor just before you go (what is it, baby?)
Just put your arms around me and hold me like you used (I want to hold you tight)

Rick James,"Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh, Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashin
While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run
Galveston, oh, Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying
In the sun, at Galveston, at Galveston","Give It to Me Baby [1981/Live in Long Beach, Ca]"
