Lorene Drive,"You put
So much effort in to it
Does it feel good to hurt someone
Trying to make you proud

You put
So much effort in to it
Does it make you feel good
A kiss won't this make this better

This is my last good bye
A kiss won't make this better
A kiss won't make this right
I know you got my letter

Just unlock the door
Are you sitting down
I think you might want to
It seems you have everything

Under control, this is my life
One thing to hold on to",A Kiss Won't Make This Better
Lorene Drive,"She's a killer know what I'm talking about
But I might have been mistaken, overreacting
Come lets face it, your so dramatic you might
as well embrace it

She looks so good it hurts what am I supposed to do
Oh girl for sure I would 
you know I might as well
Let it go

A broken heart don't seem so bad
But she looks so good it hurts
Take a breath not another word 
But she looks so good it hurts

That girls a killer I think it's safe to say
This girls got me dying to survive her
I can't deny her come lets face your so dramatic
You might as well",Let It Go
Lorene Drive,"I'll try and cover all the bases
Something to really kill my reputation
All buttoned up
Ready to go

Forget tonight
Forget everything you know
A little light weight lip service
To get me through the night
To the sound of your teeth

I can't believe you saw truth naked
Another way to really kill my reputation
A little light weight lip service
To get me through the night

So tired of going to sleep
To the sound of your teeth grinding
I've been wrong before
And I've been right
I've never felt so right about nothing
Besides, how you and me
Will always work out",Lip Service
Lorene Drive,"She said let go, goodbye
So pathetic yet it seems so right
I said alright, okay
Anything to make me go away

If you get back before I do 
If you could only hear me through
It used to be so easy

Oh no you've gone and done it 
All over time and time again
She said alright okay
Anything to make me away

I said oh no don't cry
Another day like this 
And I'll lose my mind
Cause it seems to me your leaving

You must have your reasons
Again another season, one more day
And my heart stops beating",So Easy
Lorene Drive,"Some say I'm just a singer
I say another sinner
Don't blame these bloody fingers
Because I know I've gotten further
Than anyone that I know now

Much better than I ever knew before
It's such a wonderful chemistry
It's just a wonderful thing
You better not pour me that drink
Because you're my favorite enemy

Build me up baby don't break me down
So go ahead and pour that drink
Cause you're the only one for me
Some say I don't meet the standard
To avoid a great disaster

Don't blame these worn out fingers
Cause I know oh yes I know
You dance around the obvious
Around the bush you beat too much
Don't lie to me just be straight up

Start over
If you consider me a friend",Some Kind of Love
Lorenn Peer,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Lorenn Peer,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Lorenzo,"When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What'd you see on a night so clear
In the sky so very dear

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong
Born a man child of the sun
Saw your work had just begun

Found I had to stand alone
Bless it now I've got my own
So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to these words and heed
Be you giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom are ?Yes I can?

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be",Shining Star
Lorenzo Antonio,"All my life I've been in love with you,
now you are here, I can't believe it's true.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me.

In my dreams I've kissed your lips of wine,
now all at once I find you're really mine.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me.

The way that I feel
is so heavenly, too good to be real.
When you're next to me I'm so afraid
that I'm fast asleep so don't wake me up,
let me dream if I'm dreaming.

Oh my love, each time I hold your hand,
everything is just the way I planned.
I must be dreaming
when you say that you're in love with me
",Creo Estar Soñando
Lorenzo Antonio,"Si es un pobre iluso
Díselo cree que ya me olvidaste
Dile que has venido
Y dile también que por las noches
Vuelves a vestirte, con mi cariño

Dile que nunca, mi amor
Podrás de ti despintarlo
Que solo esperas
Que yo te repita que te amo

No lo quieres, no lo engañes
Vamos dile que te olvide

Dile que vivo en tu memoria
Cuéntale ya la verdad
Dile que vivo en tu historia
No hay quien me logre borrar

Dile que sólo en mis brazos
Sueñas volverte mujer
Dile que sólo mis labios van
Brillando sobre tu piel

No pierdas tiempo, ya no
Dile que suelte tus alas
Que sabe inútil jamás
Tendrá tu amor en sus garras

No, no lo quieres, no lo engañes
Vamos dile que te olvide

Dile que vivo en tu memoria
Cuéntale ya la verdad
Dile que vivo en tu historia
No hay quien me logre borrar

Dile que sólo en mis brazos
Sueñas volverte mujer
Dile que solo mis labios van
Brillando sobre tu piel
En tu piel

Dile que vivo en tu memoria
Cuéntale ya la verdad
Dile que vivo en tu historia
No hay quien me logre borrar

Dile que solo en mis brazos
Sueñas volverte mujer
Dile que sólo mis labios van
Brillando sobre tu piel
En tu piel

Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Me dejaste abrazado de un poste
Esperándote y nunca llegaste
Me dijiste que ahí te esperará
Bien recuerdo que me lo juraste
Ya muy noche me fuí de la esquina
Y a tomar me metí a una cantina

Me senté y le pedí al cantinero
Una copa y después la botella
Junto a mí se arrimó un compañero
Que muy triste me dijo su pena
El también se quedó en una esquina
A la cita tampoco fue ella

Conversamos le dije tú nombre
Dirección y la casa en que vives
Un cigarro me pidió aquel hombre
¡Cantinero!, otra copa nos sirve
Ya no sigas me dijo llorando
Es la misma que estuve esperando

Conversamos le dije tú nombre

Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Ya vine de donde andaba 
Se me concedio volver 
A mi se me afiguraba 
Que no te volvería a ver 
Pareces amapolita 
Cortarda al amanecer 

Si por que vengo de lejos 
Me niegas la luz del día 
Se me hace que a tu esperanza 
Le paso lo que a la mía 
Por andar en la vagancia 
Perdí a un amor que tenia 

Estrellita reluciente 
De la nube colorada 
Si tienes amor pendiente 
Puedes darle retirada 
Ya llego el que andaba ausente 
Y ese no consiente nada 

Si por que vengo de lejos 
Me niegas la luz del día 
Se me hace que a tu esperanza 
Le paso lo que a la mía 
Por andar en la vagancia 
Perdí a un amor que tenia 

Estrellita reluciente

Si tienes amor pendiente 
Puedes darle retirada 
Ya llego el que andaba ausente 
Y ese no consiente nada",El Ausente
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Nadie sabe cuanto tiempo
Traía cargando amarguras
Como recuerdo a mí viejo
Y sus tantas aventuras

Se le volvieron los años
En su rostro una madeja
Y transformó su sonrisa
Tan sólo por una mueca

Sí encuentras en tú camino
A un hombre que va llorando
Dile que a diario en mis rezos
Su nombre voy pronunciando

Por señas tiene ojos tristes
Herido su corazón
Es viejo y de pelo blanco
Su mirada puro amor

Ese señor de las cañas
Que en las buenas y en las malas
Siempre supo responder
Fué pobre allá por su infancia
Tuvo un poco de ignorancia
Pero la logró vencer

Sí encuentras en tú camino
A un hombre que va llorando
Dile que a diario en mis rezos
Su nombre voy pronunciando

Andador de mil veredas
De pueblos y calles viejas
Donde quedaron sus años
Donde acabaron sus penas",Ese Se単or de Las Canas
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"En una mesa señores
Perdí lo que mas quería
Era una medalla de oro
Que me dio mi madre un día
La cambie por un tequila
Malagrada suerte mía.

Un domingo en la mañana
Un amigo me avisaba
Que la mujer que yo amaba
Con otro hombre se casaba
Me diriji a una cantina
A ver si hay la olvidaba.

Serian las 11 o las 12
O las dos de la mañana
Borracho y ya sin dinero
La sinfo no la tocaba
Me desprendí la medalla
Era lo que me quedaba.
Dicen que yo llegue al baile
Cuando mi Aurora rayaba
Al ver en brazos de otro hombre
A la mujer que yo amaba
Le descargue la pistola
Cuando de mi se burlaba
Por eso tras de las rejas
Al cielo perdón imploro
Matarla no me arrepiento
Aunque fue mi gran tesoro
Lo que lloro y lo que siento
Es la medallita de oro.",La Medallita de Oro
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Siempre que paso por su casa
Al pie de su ventana
Me pongo yo a chiflar

Oigo a su mami que le dice
Llegó el del chiflidito
Que lata nos dará

Hija ese no te conviene
Nada más te entretiene
Nomás sabe chiflar

Hija sí sales a la puerta
La dejas bien abierta
No se vaya a mandar

Sales nomás un momentito
Sí te pide un besito
Lo pones a chiflar

Cuando su mamá se descuida
Nos vamos calle arriba
No dejo de chiflar

Cuando en obscuro rinconcito
Los dos ya muy solitos
La empiezo yo a besar

Oigo a su mami que le grita
¡Ya métete lupita
Ya no lo oigo chiflar

Ella se mete apresurada
Y yo de retirada
Pués vuelvo yo a chiflar",El Silbidito
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Dicen que venían del sur
En un carro colorado
Traían cien kilos de coca
Iban con rumbo a Chicago

Así lo dijo el soplón
Que los había denunciado
Ya habían pasado la aduana
La que está en El Paso, Texas

Pero en mero San Antonio
Lo estaban esperando
Eran los rinches de Texas
Que comandan el condado

Una sirena lloraba
Un emigrante gritaba
Que detuvieran el carro

Para que lo registraran
Y que no se resistieran
Porque si no los mataban
Surge un M-16

Cuando iba rugiendo el aire
El faro de una patrulla
Se vio volar por el aire
Así empezó aquel combate

Donde fue aquella masacre
Decía Lino Quintana
Esto tenía que pasar
Mis compañeros han muerto

Ya no podrán declarar
Y yo lo siento sheriff
Porque yo no se cantar
De los siete que murieron
Solo las cruces quedaron

Cuatro eran del carro rojo
Los otros tres del gobierno
Por ellos no se preocupen
Irán con Lino al infierno

Dicen que eran del Cantil
Otros que eran del Altar
Hasta por ahí dicen muchos
Que procedían del Parral
La verdad nunca se supo
Nadie los fue a declarar

",La Banda del Carro Rojo
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Animas que no amanezca 
Que sea puro a media noche 
Y hasta donde el cuerpo aguante 
Hay que darle cuanto quieras 
Sin dudas y sin temores 

Que al cabo mundo hay te quedas 

Animas que no amanezca 
Hoy que estoy como quería 
Que al fin yo aquí estoy de paso 
Y la aurora día con día 
Y quiero estar en los brazos 
Del amor del alma mía 

Animas que no amanezca 
Y se haga de madrugada 

Pa que el amor crezca y crezca como 
La hiedra en el agua 
Animas que no amanezca
Para vivir a lo grande 
Esta pasion tan inmensa 
Que no me cabe en la sangre 

Animas que no amanezca
Y se haga de madrugada 
Pa` que el amor crezca y crezca

Que no me cabe en la sangre",Animas Que No Amanezca
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Oiga mi amigo porque esta tan triste
Pues como no si me sobra razón
Porque a la joven que amaba en un tiempo
Me ha abandonado por otro nuevo amor

Como a las once se embarca lupita
Se va a embarcar en un buce de vapor
Y yo quisiera formarle un chubasco
Y detenerle su navegación

Como a las once se embarca lupita

Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Salierón de San Isidro
Procedentes de Tijuana 
Traían las llantas del carro 
Repletas de hierba mala 
Eran Emilio Varela
Y Camelia, la Texana 

Pasaron por San Clemente 
Los paró la emigración 
Les pidió sus documentos 
Les dijó: ""¿De donde son?"" 
Ella era de San Antonio
Un hembra de corazón 

Un hembra si quiere un hombre 
Por el puede dar la vida 
Pero hay que tener cuidado 
Si esa hembra se siente herida
La traición y el contrabando 
Son cosas incompartidas

A Los Angeles llegarón 
A Hollywood se pasaron 
En un callejón oscuro 
Las cuatro llantas cambiarón 
Ahí entregarón la hierba
Y ahí también les pagarón 

Emilio dice a Camelia 
""Hoy te das por despedida
Con la parte que te toca
Tu puedes rezar tu vida 
Yo me voy para San Francisco 
Con la dueña de mi vida""

Camelia a Emilio mataba 
En un callejón oscuro 
Sin que se supiera nada 

Del dinero y de Camelia 
Nunca más se supo nada",Contrabando y Traicion
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"De esta sierra a la otra sierra
Se divisa San José
Vida mía de mis amores
Que me vine y los deje

Cuando salí de mi casa
De nadie me despedí
Nomas de unos tinamantes
Y un gato que estaba ahí

Solo yo iba caminando
Sin saber a dónde ir
Otra tierra iba buscando
Sin saber que iba a sufrir

No lloro por que ando lejos
De mi novia que deje
Me acuerdo de los consejos
De mis padres que olvide

Pasaron meses enteros
Yo empezaba a recordar
Que mis padres me dijeron
Que no los fuera a olvidar

Su bendiciones me dejaron
Y en mi mente guardo yo
Al quedar solo ellos murieron
Y mi novia se caso

De esta sierra a la otra sierra
Se divisa San José
Vida mía de mis amores
Que me vine y los deje

Pasaron meses enteros
Yo empezaba a recordar
Que mis padres me dijeron
Que no los fuera a olvidar

Su bendiciones me dejaron
Y en mi mente guardo yo
Al quedar solos murieron
Y mi novia se caso

Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Salieron de madrugada 
Se oía el canto de los 
Iban a ser dos jornadas 
A lomo de sus caballos 
La fiesta se celebraba en 
El rancho del pitayo 

Su padre les dio un consejo 
Cuando a partir se prestaban 
Cuiden muy bien su pellejo 
Por que la vida se acaba 
En las palabras del viejo 
Los tres hermanos pensaban 

Pedro le dice a fabian:
Dale un trago a jose luis 
Que beba de ese mezcal 
Pa' que se sienta feliz 
Que aorita no mas llegar 
Nos vamos a divertir 

Cuando arribaron al baile 
A bailar se dirigieron 
La muerte andaba en el aire 
Ellos no la presintieron 
Como les dijo su padre 
Cuando del rancho salieron 

Eran muchos los rivales 
Viejos rencores surgieron 
Rondando tras los jacales 
Abrieron todos el fuego 
Asi matan los cobardes 
Cuando los acosa el miedo 

Un viejito solitario 
Sin esperanza ninguna 
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos 
Como toda su fortuna 
Va al panteón de ves en cuando 
A visitar las tres tumbas",Las Tres Tumbas
Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Bajando la ladera
Por el camino viene bailando
Arrastra la sandalia
La polvareda va levantando
Moviendo la cintura
Y las caderas como ninguna

Tiene la piel morena
Sonrisa clara
Color de luna

Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Arrastra la sandalia
Llévame en tu locura
Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna

La noche es una niña
Que va pasando, que va creciendo
La música no para
Sigue bailando, se va encendiendo

El sudor de su cuerpo
Le pone brillo a su piel canela
La blusa colorada,
La madrugada y esa morena

Tiene cosas de blanca
Tiene cosas de negra
Tiene cosas de india
Bonita mezcla que da esta tierra

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Moviendo las caderas
Moviendo la cintura

Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna
Arrastra la sandalia
Llévame en tu locura
Baila morena, baila
Que tú lo bailas como ninguna

Lorenzo de Monteclaro,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez
Lorenzo del Paraguay,"Como te extraño mi amor por que sera
Me falta todo en la vida si no estas
Como te extraño mi amor que debo hacer
Te extraño tanto que voy a enloquecer

Ahy amor divino...
Pronto tienes que volver a mi

A veces pienso que tú nunca vendras
Pero te quiero why te tengo k esperar
Es el destino me lleva hasta el final
Donde algun dia mi amor te encontrara

Ahy amor divino...
Pronto tienes que volver a mi

Why entregarte todo mi corazón

Lorenzo Fragola,"Aspettando a lungo che sorgesse il sole
Tra il sapore dei miei baci e del caffè
Noi distesi sopra un letto di parole
Dopo un po' guardandomi dicesti che

È un'estate da vivere
Un'estate di noi
I ray-ban, la vodka e l'odore del mare
# fuori c'è il sole
Lo vuoi condividere?

Sulla sabbia a rincorrere un pallone
Come se la spiaggia fosse un privè
E le notti passate a fare cazzate
Un film dell'orrore e quattro risate
Non sai che fortuna passarle con te
Oh dimmi che
Un'estate da vivere
Un'estate di noi

I ray-ban, la vodka e l'odore del mare
# fuori c'è il sole
Lo vuoi condividere?
Lo vuoi condividere?
Questo inverno dove andremo non importa

Ma la mia barca segue il vento e non la rotta
Ma se vuoi tu invece puoi seguire me

Saremo liberi, ora tu stringimi,

Lorenzo Fragola,"Passerà, stanotte passerà
E forse torneremo, ad amarci
Impazzirai, lo so che impazzirai
Perché non ci basta il tempo
Perché nulla basta mai
Anche se in fondo il nostro è amore
Usiamo stupide parole
Perché è stupido chi pensa che non serva anche il dolore
E siamo vicini ma lontani, e troppi tentativi vani

E forse arriverà, domani
Siamo uguali in fondo
E forse cercherai, le mie mani
Solo per un giorno
Non scappare dai miei sguardi
Non possono inseguirti, non voltarti dai
E forse capirai, quanto vali
Potrei darti il mondo
Ma griderai, sul silenzio della pioggia
E' rancore e mal di testa, su una base un po' distorta
Ti dirò, siamo uguali come vedi
Perché senza piedistalli, non riusciamo a stare in piedi
Ed è già tardi e vuoi far piano
Il cuore è il tuo bagaglio a mano perché hai tutti i pregi che odio
E quei difetti che io amo
E schegge di una voce rotta, mi hanno ferito un'altra volta

Ma forse arriverà, domani
Siamo uguali in fondo
E forse cercherai, le mie mani
Solo per un giorno
Non scappare dai miei sguardi
Non possono inseguirti, non voltarti dai
E forse capirai, quanto vali
Potrei darti il mondo
Ma io non ci sarò e vedrai
Sarà semplice
Scivolare per
Poi atterrare fra le braccia di chi vuoi

Ma forse arriverà, domani

Solo per un giorno
Non scappare dai miei sguardi
Non possono inseguirti, non voltarti dai

And we're slowing down for the sun
To look into his eyes
To tell him we don't mind
Walking streets of cities
I met god

In this emptiness
We lose the road
And I hope you're saving yourself

Nella meccanica che incolla due corpi

Ho ancora addosso il nostro ultimo abbraccio
Che ha congelato tempo, fiato e coraggio
Che mi ha lasciato con le costole rotte
Senza riuscire ad arrestare il cuore 

È il primo giorno senza di te
La pioggia è fitta che non si vede niente
Ma io mi sento bene 
E voglio dirti grazie perché
La tua ferita è stata la migliore
E mi ha fatto bene

E con le mani ci siamo allontanati
Ma tutte le distanze sono uguali se
Ci siamo amati e poi ci siamo armati
E non sai perché ma ti mancherò
L'amore non è cieco ma chiude gli occhi
E vede solamente quando lo tocchi
E tutto resta uguale solo nei sogni
Ma il mondo cambia pure quando dormi

Lorenzo Fragola,"Butterò questo mio enorme cuore tra le stelle un giorno
Giuro che lo farò
E oltre l'azzurro della tenda

Quando la donna cannone 
D'oro e d'argento diventerà
Senza passare dalla stazione 
L'ultimo treno prenderà
E in faccia ai maligni e ai superbi 
Il mio nome scintillerà
Dalle porte della notte 
Il giorno si bloccherà 
Un applauso del pubblico pagante lo sottolineerà 
E dalla bocca del cannone una canzone suonerà

E con le mani amore
Per le mani ti prenderò 
E senza dire parole 
Nel mio cuore ti porterò 
E non avrò paura 
Se non sarò come bella come dici tu 
Ma voleremo in cielo in carne ed ossa
Non torneremo più, na na na na na 
E senza fame e senza sete 
E senza ali e senza rete 
Voleremo via

Così la donna cannone
Quell'enorme mistero, volò
E tutta sola verso un cielo nero, nero 
S'incamminò
Tutti chiusero gli occhi nell'attimo esatto in cui sparì
Altri giurarono e spergiurarono che non erano mai stati lì

Non facile mentire
Ma non sono mai stato capace
A far l’amore senza amore
A far l’amore senza amore

Che non avrei più vissuto

Ci sono cose da dimenticare
Da rivivere

In un lunapark
Per scappare dal peso della gravità
Zero gravity

Mi distrae la tua mancanza
È come se giocasse a nascondino
Senza averne mai abbastanza

Che la vita ci inganna
Che non so più chi sei

Sospesi tra gli sbagli commessi
Ci sentiamo un po' persi in questa camera
E abbiamo sempre gli stessi
Tatuaggi sbiaditi 
Cerchiamo di sentirci sicuri
Come due astronauti
In un lunapark
Per scappare dal peso della gravità

Zero gravity

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby

Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart

Loretta Goggi,"Mi solletica certo l'idea
Di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma perché quest’idea che mi stuzzica,
Pizzica, mi eccita tanto di te

Sorriso smagliante, perfetta criniera
Mi chiedo che tattica scegli stasera
Con una che ha l'aria un po' fredda, un po' dura
Non crederci non e' paura

Tu che sai piacere un po' a tutti e a nessuno
Chissà se davvero ti senti qualcuno
Per essere buono sei troppo gentile
Mi sento infantile però

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una notte con te
A svegliare le strade, a frustare De Sade, a parlare di te
E' al mattino dividere il pane croccante, biscotti e caffè
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio ma forse non faccio per te

Vedi essendo un poco miope ti vedo così blù
Che mi piaci suppergiù, per cui
Mi solletica certo l'idea di sapere il tuo letto che cosa racconta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea
Di lasciarci una lunga e indelebile impronta

Ma certo tesoro, scherzavo un pochino
Se ho detto stanotte che voglio un bambino
Se avessi I miei muscoli ed il tuo cervello
Non credo verrebbe un modello

Ma no, è troppo facile prenderti in giro
In fondo è soltanto al tuo cuore che miro
Per dirla sul serio, per dirtela tutta
Mi sento un po' matta però

Mi solletica il cuore l'idea di passare una vita con te
A tentare altre strade a bruciare De Sade, a cambiare con te
E al mattino dividere un bacio leggero che sa di caffè
Seduttore di ghiaccio ti abbraccio però non lo faccio perché

C'è che al buio anche miope io non ti vedo più
E mi piaci a tu per tu per cui

Mi solletica certo l'idea di un amore che resta un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica I sensi l'idea di una notte di quelle che un uomo racconta

C'è che al buio anche miope con te ci vedo blu
E mi piaci sempre più per cui
Mi solletica sempre l'idea di lasciarti se non è un amore che conta
Ma mi solletica il cuore l'idea di tornare da te quando il sole tramonta

Ma chissà se l'idea che mi stuzzica,
Pizzica ed eccita un poco anche te",Mi solletica l'idea
Loretta Holloway,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Loretta Holloway,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say - come dance with me
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said - pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say - come on, dance with me
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen",At Seventeen

You're a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh I've been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady, don't just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies

Oh I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things
That a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie. A fantasy we create about
People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, and it's that man you fought with
This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to cryin' for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life and never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free

Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, wouldn't that be great?

In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of what a man he was
In the name of love, in the name of love

Love went away when the sexy lace wouldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste

You'd better not believe everything you hear
So watch him close than love him all you can

I go home home where the mockingbirds are singin' a pretty melody
Home home where nothing short of heaven's waiting there for me

Picture the morning sun a white rail fence and watch the meadow glisten
There's a newborn baby calf down in the barn
Have you morning cup of coffee in the country air oh listen
It's a hundred million miles away from harm
I go home
Where nothing short of heaven's waiting there for me",Home
Loretta Lynn,"I've been living a new way of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gathering and the storm will wreck our home
For last night she hugged you tightly and you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching from the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping oh Lord I wish that I had been
But it's best to get to know you and the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together and our hearts fit like a glove
But I was wrong for I've been watching from the window up above

From my eyes the teardrops started as I listened on and on
Heard you whisper to her softly that our marriage was all wrong
But I hope she makes you happy and you'll never lose her love
I lost mine while I was watching from the window up above
How I wished I could be dreaming wake up to the love that's true
But I can't for I was watching from the window up above",Window Up Above
Loretta Lynn,"I can't seem to learn not to love you you get to me every time
You're someone I just can't say no to you're so good at changin' my mind
Here I go down that wrong road again goin' back where I've already been
Even knowing where it will end here I go down that wrong road again

Though I see the web that you're weavin' you and your soft easy line
Before I stop to think I'm believin' and I'm fallin' for you one more time

Yes, another man loved me last night
I'd almost forgotten what love was really like
But I'm only human only a woman
I let another man love me last night

While he's sleepin', well, I'm cryin' here awake
Not being loved was more than I could take

Like a Rhinestone Cowboy getting cards and letter from people he don't even know
And offers coming over the phone

He really don't mind the rain and a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're riding the train that's taking the long way

Loretta Lynn,"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter,
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler.
We were poor but we had love, 
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines.
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.
Mommy rocked the babies at night,
And read the Bible by the coal oil light,
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, 
To complain, there was no need,
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair.
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog,
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,
I remember well, the well where I drew water.
The work we done was hard,
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler. 

Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again.
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore,
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter",Coal Miner's Daughter [DVD]

When you find no love at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

The bottle is almost empty
The clock just now struck ten

To our favorite place again

We know it's wrong for us to meet
But the fire's gone out at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Love is where you find it
When you find no love at home
And there's nothin' cold as ashes
After the fire is gone

Your lips are warm and tender
Your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember
That the one at home forgot

Hmmm, you'd do that for me 
You know I'd change it for you

My heart was at a standstill 
Your touch shook it up 
You made me see what I've missed 

Now I can't get enough 
I fit so right in your world 
You set my heart on go 
On the coldest day of winter 

Lord, our love would melt the snow 
Our love is hotter than the fire that swept Chicago 
Deeper than the Gulf of Mexico 
Sweeter than the sugarcane way down in Louisiana 

Here with you is where I want to be 
I'm lovin' what your lovin' does to me 
Your love struck me 
Like a bolt out of the blue 

The first thing that I knew 
I was givin' it all to you 
You make it happen 
Whenever I'm with you 

The longest day of summer 
Couldn't warm me like you do

Taller than the hills of Tennessee 

More movin' than the earthquakes that shake up California 
Here with you is where I want to be 
I'm loving what your lovin' does to me",Lovin' What Your Lovin' Does To Me [Single Version]
Loretta Lynn,"If we lost all we had
Would I walk your rocky road
Take a different path?

Would I sell my pride for you
If you asked me to walk the streets?
You know just what I'd do

Would your child have a home
If it should be born
Of love other than our own?

Would I still stand by you
Knowin' you've loved someone else?
You know just what I'd do

If my love for you meant giving up my life
Would I lay it down for you?
And if you were blind would I give you my sight?
You know just what I'd do if you ask me to

Would I live with the scar
That you carry in your heart
From another woman's war?

Would I mend your wounds for you
If I knew you needed me?
You know just what I'd do",You Know Just What I'd Do [Single Version]
Loretta Lynn,"I wasn't much more than a baby I thought he was a bear
The way my daddy carried me around
They said I learned to walk while holdin' on to just one finger
On the hand of a man that stands at six-foot-three

Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression
Just something people talked about a lot
My daddy wasn't one that tried to make no big impressions
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he got

They don't make men like my daddy anymore
Guess they've thrown away the pattern through the years
In a great big land of freedom at a time we really need 'em
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore

From the Johnson County coal camps to the hills of West Virginia
My daddy hauled the timber for the mines
Education didn't count so much as what you had born in you
Like the will to live and a dream of better times

Daddy never took a handout we ate pinto beans a bacon
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the door
And it only proves one thing to me when folks start belly achin'

They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore
They don't make men...
They don't make 'em like my daddy anymore",They Don't Make 'Em Like My Daddy
Loretta Lynn,"Dear John oh how I hate to write dear John I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John
I was overseas in battle when the mail called up to me
And they handed me a letter why I was happy as could be
For the fighting was all over and the battle had been won

Then I opened up the letter and that started Dear John
Dear John oh how I hate to write
Will you please send back my picture my husband wants it now
And when I tell you who I'm marrying well you won't care dear anyhow
Now the ceremony has started and I'll wed your brother Don
Will you wish us happiness forever dear John
And tonight I wed another dear John",A Dear John Letter
Loretta Lynn,"Just between the two of us we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care
Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love no anything there's nothing left at all
Just between the two of us",Just Between the Two of Us
Loretta Lynn,"Standing alone in a storm of life
Without any way to turn
Tears are falling down like rain
From the lessons that I have learned

And I wish that I could fly away
On the wings of a great golden bird
To a place where there are no unhappy days
And there are no unhappy words

Yes, I wish that I could fly away
To a land beyond this pain
And lay my dreams on a mountain top
And wash my mind in the rain

Burned by the fire of an untrue love
My heart is as cold as a stone
And I know for sure that the road of life
Is no place to travel alone

And I wish that I could fly away
To a land beyond this pain
And lay my dreams on a mountain top
And wash my mind in the rain

Loretta Lynn,"He rode in with the sunset and turned the TV on
We didn't talk through supper and I went to bed alone
I was softly awakened by a touch of ecstasy
Was I only dreamin' or did he make sweet love to me

Who was that stranger that rode through here last night?
He slipped into our room when I turned out the light
Who was that stranger with my ring on his hand?
Whoever he was I hope he'll ride this way again

This morning over coffee, that look was in his eyes
His touch was so familiar when he kissed me goodbye
I watched him through the window and as he rode away
He left me with a memory that I dream about all day, yeah

Loretta Lynn,"How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could only hear my mother pray again if I could only hear her tender voice as then
How happy I would be with who means so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again

So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day

And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me",In the Garden

Maybe he's crying for me and as the skies turn
Gloomy night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be

This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river

Take my hand let me stand where no one stands alone

For the one that I'm tied to was the first to prove untrue

That I was just a girl who didn't seem to care
But if they only knew how she slips around on you
They wouldn't call our love a back street affair

Sweet, sweet scenes of once upon a time
I can't picture myself with anyone else

And it hurts me because that you were right
I tell myself that I'll begin to try and forgive you but then
I go and cry myself to sleep at night
But somethin' that my mama said keeps goin' around inside my head
And if I only knew that it was cool
The time and tears will wash away this hurt I'm still in night and day
And I know that I'll get over you
Mama said one thing for certain it'll feel good when it quits hurtin'
And you know that mamas always right
And if this hurt will go away then I'll feel good again someday
And I won't ever want you in my side

And now you're spread all around just how you tore my playhouse down
And that's because you broke my heart in two
You think that love was fun and game and you don't even feel the shame
But someday it may all come home to you
And now you think you're flyin' high and you don't care how much I try
What goes up will come back down someday
And if my mama's words are true but then I won't be lovin' you
And I'll be glad I heard my mama say

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done

Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday

So I tuned in a DJ,
Who played every sad song he owned.

Loretta Lynn,"It went so well for you
With a place right where you wanted and the ones to fill it to
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you every day until you need to hit as well
It's just a shadow of the man you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
It all seemed fine for you
Till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche you need a place to run
It's just a shadow of the woman you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
And you have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there's never been a hand
Did we ever have it good
While we lived in Eldorado did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth
It's just a shadow of the people we should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there never is a hand outside that cares
Still the promise comes of living fit for all
If we only get our back against the wall
I look at backs that pushed the wall for years
Scarred by many knives and too much fear

Loretta Lynn,"There's a new expression on my face I ain't seen in quite a while
Must be a smile
There's a new direction in my life and I can't wait to see
Where it takes me
I'm no longer lost in the past,
Even my troubles just roll off my back

[Chorus]
No the blues ain't workin' on me, those old memories
Can't put the hurt in my heart
Baby, love is lettin' me know I'm finally free
And 'cause of you I'll always be
No, the blues ain't workin' on me

Anytime the sun would start to shine,
Some dark cloud would come around and start raining down
Since I found the shelter of your arms
I don't feel the rain no more so let it pour
Might be times when we lose our way
But I know tomorrow I'm still gonna say

They wanna to make me over, just a little more uptown.
Say I need to change my image, now tell me what's that mean.
Don't they know I've got country in my genes?

Well, I can't help the way I talk, I wouldn't change it if I could.
Sophisticated ain't my style, but country fits me good.
I ain't ashamed to wear what's been handed down to me.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

I've got country in my genes, country in my blood.
It goes back generations. It's something I'm proud of.
It's something I was born with, what you get is what you see.
I'm just an old hillybilly with a country song to sing.
Lord, I've got country in my genes.

Oh that Earl Scruggs.

If country's hit the big time, me, I'm still the same.
I ain't above my raisin' and I ain't about to change.
I wouldn't trade my Wranglers for the finest gaberdine.

Gettin' closer with every step he takes
Lord, I'm so afraid that if I look out the window
I'll be tempted to repeat an old mistake.

Don't open that door
To an old memory,
When he said goodbye
I locked it up tight
And threw out the key.
I've stood here before
Lord I can't stand no more
Won't go there again
Heart don't let him in
Don't open that door.

The stronger me has found the will to fight it
But now he's gone and the weaker side's in tears
Lord, it took so long to put the hurt behind me
If I don't look back the past can't find me here.

Loretta Lynn,"

Well I was born in old Kentucky

In them hills where folks are lucky

From a coal miner's daughter right to a coal miner's wife


Well the mountain folks love the mountains

White lightning flowed like the fountains

On a Sunday morning you can hear all the good folks singin


[Chorus:]

It's God's country in these hills he walks

And in the middle of the night you can hear him talk

It's the closest place to heaven that I know

If you wanna get to heaven get your road map out

It's called the bible if you have one doubt

I guess my friends, you must be on the wrong route


Well I miss the old camp meeting time and dinner on the ground

What I miss most is everything like all the country sounds

Like the lonesome sound of the whippoorwill sang me to sleep every night

And the whistle of the old freight train before daylight


[Chorus]


And my old Kentucky home's far away


",God's Country
Loretta Lynn,"There's two suitcases hid back in the closet
Packed for much more than a few days stay
And in her purse there's several thousand dollars
Years of saving for one rainy day
It scares her half to death to think of leaving
She's never been out on her own before
Too many nights she's cried while he was sleepin'
Oh but she's not sure he loves her any more

[Chorus:]
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her
Tell her how he feels down deep inside
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her
There's no way she would ever leave his side

To him she's always been a special angel
And so much more than he thought he deserved
Oh how was she to know all he's been feeling
When he could never put it into words
He was so afraid one day she'd walk out on him
He knows he's just a plain and simple man(Yes he is)
He could easily tear down that wall between them
Everything he needs to keep her's in his hands

[Chorus:]

Maybe he'll wake up in time
To hold me",Hold Her
Loretta Lynn,"He showed me there was more to me
When I thought I had nothing else to give
God knows he wasn't perfect
Ah, but then, again, nobody is

He always told me the truth
No matter how hard it was to hear
When he said, ""I believe in you""
It was music to my ears

Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune
The kind that inspires and helps me get through
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, ""You can""
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan

Now he's gone to a distant shore
And I can't hear the music anymore

Sometimes late at night
I forget that he's not lyin' next to me
He may be out of sight
But out of mine is something he won't ever be

Things that he said to me
Are still ringing out loud and clear
When he said, ""I love you, baby""
That was music to my ears

Oh, each word's like a note, like a beautiful tune
The kind that inspires and helps me get through
Ah, if I said I can't, he's say, ""You can""
He was my toughest critic, ah, my biggest fan

Now he's gone to a distant shore
And I can't hear the music anymore

In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler.
We were poor but we had love, 
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines.
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.
Mommy rocked the babies at night,
And read the Bible by the coal oil light,
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed, 
To complain, there was no need,
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair.
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog,
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,
I remember well, the well where I drew water.
The work we done was hard,
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

Loretta Lynn,"I was 11 months old
I was just starting to walk
And Daddy always kept a big stick behind the door just in case 
Somebody was to come in that was drunk on moonshine, 
You know, and Daddy had to do something about it
Anyway, this woman, we called her old Aunt Boyd,
She come in and she was telling 
Mommy about her, uh, husband, she thinks is going out with this woman in
Paintsville
So she reared back with that big stick showing 
Mommy how she was going to hit this woman in the head with it
And when she went back with it, she hit me in the head 
And Mommy said I cried for 5 days
And she said I, that fifth night, 
I had a great big knot that show up right in the middle of my forehead
And, you know, the only thing I remember, 
I don't remember no pain, but I just remember Mommy 
And Daddy carrying me in this old quilt that Mommy had made out of overhalls
The knots kept getting bigger and bigger so she took me to the doctor
And that stuff called mesitor, something like that
Mommy said it made both ears flat to my face and I ain't got very big ears
And told Mommy that I would, that I was going to die
And that happened like four times so I didn't walk till I was almost 5
It was, it was kind of a mess

Oh I forgot about the shoes,
Well shoot, I hadn't
I'd never had a pair of shoes
And Mommy had went
Took me to the hospital, you know, to see what that was
If they couldn't do something
But they wouldn't keep me because Mommy and Daddy didn't have no money
They just tell 'em to take me home and let me die, you know, 
Because there wasn't nothing they could do about
That kind of disease, I guess
And, um, Mommy told Daddy, 
Says ""Ted, you take her down the street, you carry her down the street..."" and said,
""...let me try this store here,"" and Mommy went in and told them the story that I was dying, 
That she had to carry me twelve miles to town 
And twelve miles back and that I had no shoes
That place, I think it was Murphy's 5 and 10 and they're still there in Paintsville, Kentucky
And I think that they told Mommy that they wasn't in business to give shoes away
Mommy told Daddy, says, ""Carry Loretta on down a little farther,"" 
Said, ""and let me stop in another store...""
And Mommy went right back to the same store
When the guy's back was turned she stole these little red shoes
And I remember on the big'old bridge that went across the river
It went way up high and was... 
I've always been scared of that bridge that took me across the big Sandy River
Mommy pulled them out from under that yellow jacket that she was wearing
And she was putting them red shoes on me 
And I thought them was the prettiest things I ever saw in my life
And Daddy started crying
And I wondered why
And he said, ""Clerie, we're not going to make it home,""
And Mommy put the shoes on me
And Daddy took off running and run all the way ahead t'Butcher Holler with me
And Mommy never had a chance to carry me any farther
And that's almost twelve miles that Daddy run with me
But Daddy knew that the cops was going to get us
He left Mommy standing and he took off in a dead run
I remember him running but I didn't know what for

And I remember asking Mommy, 
""Mommy, why is Daddy running?""
I remember her hollering, 
""To put your little red shoes away, honey, when you get home.""

Can you believe that?
So I wrote a song called ""Put My Little Red Shoes Away,"" 
You know, they're my little red shoes and I don't want
'Em to get... to be dirty",Little Red Shoes

In a booth in the corner with the lights down low
I was movin' in fast, she was takin' it slow, uh huh, uh huh
Well, I looked at him and caught him lookin' at me
I knew right then we were playin' free in Oregon

Next day, we knew last night got drunk
But we loved enough for the both of us, uh huh, uh huh
In the morning when the night had sobered up
It was much too late for the both of us in Oregon

Well, sloe gin fizz works mighty fast
When you drink it by the pitcher and not by the glass, uh huh, uh huh
Hey bartender, before you close
Pour us one more drink and a pitcher to go

And a pitcher to go

In them hills where folks are lucky

Loretta Lynn,"1, 2, 3

Oh if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell
It would tell about the good times
And the bad times as well
It would tell about the love that lived
And died inside these walls
And the sound of the little footsteps
Runnin' up and down the halls

Oh, if this old house could talk
It would break my heart in two
I couldn't stand to be reminded
Of all the things we used to do
There's no love in this old house no more
So I got it up for sale
Why if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell

Oh, if this old house could talk
I know what it would say
I'm as lonesome as you are
And I fell more empty every day
I even miss the baby
Who built me up to feel this way
Why if this old house could talk
Lord, I know what it would say

Yeah, if this old house could talk
What a story it would tell
We'll build this home together
And with love we drove each nail
Take me in your arms and hold me
'Cause we've been apart too long
Why if this old house could talk
All it would say is welcome home

Loretta Lynn,"One of my fondest memories
Was sittin' on my daddy's knee
Listenin' to the stories that he told 
He'd pull out that old photograph
Like a treasured memory from the past 
And say child
This here's the Van Lear Rose

Oh how it would bring a smile 
When he talked about her big blue eyes
And how her beauty ran down to her soul
She'd walk across the coal miner's yard 
Them miner's would yell loud and hard 
And they'd dream of who would hold
The Van Lear Rose

She was the belle of Johnson County
Ohio river to Big Sandy
A beauty to behold like a diamond in the coal
All the miner's they would gather 'round 
Talk about the man that came to town
Right under their nose 
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

Now the Van Lear Rose could've had her pick
And all the fellers figured rich
Until this poor boy caught her eye
His buddies would all laugh and say
Your dreamin' boy she'll never look your way
You'll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose

She was the belle of Johnson County
Ohio river to Big Sandy
A beauty to behold like a diamond in the coal
All the miner's they would gather 'round 
Talk about the man that came to town
Right under their nose 
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

Then one night in mid July
Underneath that ol' blue Kentucky sky
Well, that poor boy won that beauty's heart
Then my daddy would look at my mommy and smile
As he brushed the hair back from my eyes and he'd say
Your mama

Loretta Lynn,"I'm in a women's prison
With bars all around
I caught my darlin' cheating
That's when I shot him down

I caught him in a honky-tonk
With a girl I used to know
The door to my cell is open wide
And a voice cries out oh no

The judge says I'm guilty
My sentence is to die
I know I've been forgiven
But the price of love is high

The crowd outside is screamin'
Let the murderer die
But above all their voices
I can hear my mama cry

I'm sittin' here on death row
And Lord I've lost my mind
For love I've killed my darlin'
And for love I'll lose my life

I can hear the warden coming
From the clinging of his keys
But when they come to get me
He'll have to drag me off my knees

The door to my cell swings open
It's time for me to go
The priest is reading my last rights
He says, ""Dying's part of livin' you know""

There's a crowd outside screamin'
Let that murderer fry
But above all their voices
You can hear my mama cry

Now they've strapped me in the chair
And covered up my eyes
And the last voice I hear on earth
Is my mama's cry

Are you listening in the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight

While we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married We'll say no man
But you can do the job  When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire

Lorez Alexandria,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

But I can see you,
Your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

I never will forget those nights.
I wonder if it was a dream.

Remember how I made you scream.

And always it's leaving the back door open
For the endlessly running away that I do

It's like that joke
How can you miss me if you won't go away
Well darling I may still surprise you one day
For each sincere goodmorning I've managed to say

Don't be alone

Do you miss me like I'm missing you?

Lori Carson,"It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you
So we walked along,
though I knew there was something wrong
And the feeling hot me oh so strong about you
Then you gazed up at me and the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light in your eyes

Though we had our fling
I just never would suspect a thing
'Til that little bell began to ring in my head
In my head
But I tried to run,
though I knew it wouldn't help me none
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
But my feelings for you
were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light in your eyes

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
In my eyes
And I ran out before but I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes",I Saw the Light

This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Who only wants to run around

With really not too much to say
So you can push me anywhere you like
But you can't push me away

My life is written down on papers in my room
And yours is bottled up somewhere
So I'll send you letters from half across the moon
And it will cross your mind but you won't dare

Pieces of me can't help you
Pieces of me can't let you fall down
Where you want to be

I can hold you like water in my hands
Yet you say that you can't leave
But I am dripping wet with things to understand
And you are trying to believe

Pieces of me can't help you
Pieces of me can't let you fall down
Where you want to be

And I know I promised you that the Lord would be my friend
But the Lord and I don't get along so very good
He doesn't speak a word out to me
Like you promised that he would
And I'm telling you
I wish I was a better person

When the clouds roll in and the sky promises rain
You just accept the way she is and you don't even complain
Though you wish that it was sunny and the sky would stay blue
You don't accept a thing about me
And wish that I was just like you
But I'm telling you
I wish I was a better person

I don't want to work at it
It should come naturally
It shouldn't be so difficult
Should be more like honey to the bee

Well the bee has his sting and the sky has her rain
And I have all of my things that I shouldn't do over again
But if I just say the words and I look you in the eye
That I am promising you, I promise
I wish I was a better person

I don't want to work at it
It should come naturally
It shouldn't be so difficult
Should be more like honey to the bee

Lori McKenna,"They're building up big houses
Back behind the school
Where we used to drink our beer on Friday nights
And pretend that we were lovers in your car

We can't afford to live there
So we drive on past their marble and glass
Hoping that this blue collar town of ours
Won't ever lose its balls

I was just a little girl
When your hand brushed by my hand
And I will be an old woman
Happy to have spent my whole life with one man

Behind that school we found romance
We laid in the dirt and took off our shirts
While the lucky ones would fly away
On planes to other cities, other towns

Now they're building up houses
Big enough to lose your love
Big enough to never even see
One another in the dark

One man, one town is all I need
A simple plan to guide me
Through the simple life I lead
I have seen the ocean and I have seen the sky
I do not need a big house or the ability to fly

We'll remember the summers
The crumbling town streets, running from police
And acting like we'd leave this place
The minute we ever had the chance",One Man
Lori McKenna,"The number to the house is on the door 
But every time you open it, it's as if you are not sure 
If you even live here anymore, anymore
Well I know what you're about to say
I know that look there on your face 
But I'm tired of reading your mind this way 
So why don't you say it 

You're tearing me up inside, you're tearing me up inside
It feels like something in me died, feels like something in me died
All of the bright colors that live inside of me are now 
Just tiny pieces of what used to be 
And it just feels like confetti

Well I remember on our wedding day 
Thinking how those flowers would all just fade away 
And it seemed like such a waste of beauty

And
Now your tearing me up inside
You're tearing me up inside
Feels like something in me died, feels like something in me died 
All of the bright colors that lived inside of me 
Are now just tiny pieces of what used to be 
And it just feels like confetti, confetti

Isn't it a crying shame that nothing ever stays the same?
I can't fit into that wedding dress or be 23 again 
But you're looking at me now like you don't know who I am

What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You
Lori Moran,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Lori Moran,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

It rains pennies from heaven

Make sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
Cause if you want the things you love, you must have showers

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Oh Jimmy Mack, you better hurry back.

Keeps reaching out to be his friend

One Christmas we both asked for bikes
One in red, one blue and white

My first ride from our house to yours
From our house to yours
Twenty-one mailboxes, twenty-one doors
For ten years or more
It was back and forth from our house to yours
One summer we both had a crush
On a boy who lived down the road from us
He liked me but he liked you more
I watched him go from our house to yours
I remember the day you turned thirteen
Thought you had grown too old for me
But I taught you make-up, you taught me boys
We burned up the phone lines from our house to yours
From our house to yours
Seven numbers, twenty-one doors
For ten years or more
I knew way from our house to yours
I'll never forget that awful day
When the moving van took you away
I cried till my eyes were red and sore
Five hundred miles from our house to yours
It had been a while since you crossed my mind
Then a card in the mailbox at Christmas time
With an evergreen wreath on a red front door
Saying lots of love from our house to yours

Oh,by the way,I was downtown this afternoon
And I saw the most amazing sight

I saw a man and a woman holdin' hands
And they looked so much in love it took my breath away

They were talkin' and they were laughin'
Just like we used to do every day
And then he kissed her tenderly

Who was right and who was wrong and who's to know 
My anger turned to sorrow as my tears began to pour

The world took on a different point of view 
I loosened up my grip around that steering wheel 
And I wondered if you were sorry too

Felt the cool wind blowing through my hair 
I saw the crimson light embrace the setting sun

To call you up and tell you I was coming home

Lorrie Morgan,"Well he walked into the room with his love de jour
She was a pony-tailed porcelain doll
She was draped on his arm like a fine mink fur
She was at his beck and call
I couldn't hear a word he said
But I've heard it all before
And like a rusty hinge on an eerie night
When you slowly close the door

He sent chills up and down,up and down my spine
He does it to me every time
It's just a case of heart over mind
And still,somehow,he gets to me
Well I ain't deaf,and I ain't dumb or blind
It's just an elementary,simple case of heart over mind

Well,he walked into my life full of savior faire
Oh,the things he could say with a smile
And I fell in love on the spot,right there
Good Lord,that man had style
Now I know better then to take him back
But I'll take a second look
''cause I still get weak when he walks my way
''cause he sure did a body good

I wanted to talk to you this morning,
And on into the afternoon
But you were out somewhere,
So I couldn't get to you
I needed to make a connection,
I needed to say your name
So I spoke it to myself,
But it wasn't the same
And it seems like I want you around me
A little more than you want to be,
So I guess
I'm the one with the greater need
It's not fair, it's not right,
The way I need you here tonight
I'm so mad, you just don't know,
'cause it always seems to me
I'm the one with the greater need
It's so hard to want somebody,
More than they want you
It's something everybody,

But sometimes it's hard to admit it,

Just a little happiness, you were lucky that you found 
I might be that one I love you, that you meant but wouldn't say 
I just might be the best damn thing that you ever threw away

Do you wish that it was different, do you realize just what you had

Why can't he turn it down?
He keeps that TV up so loud that I can't think
Every time I turn a page
He starts to talk about his day
Can't he see
I'm trying to read
It's cold enough in here to freeze
He keeps it 68 degrees
What's that man been thinking of
In all the years we've been together
You'd think he'd know me better than he does
I sit there wondering to myself
Why he wears the same old clothes
With any sense, he'd know they're out of style
And damn that man why can't he tell
I'm dying in this house
I ain't been out on the town in quite a while
And can't he tell what mood I'm in
The way I've got my back to him
I don't feel like making love
In all the years we've been together,
You'd think he'd know me better than he does
I sit there thinking to myself
Why he's been coming home so late
He knows that supper's waiting on the stove
I sit there lying to myself
About the suitcase in the hall
And the night I heard him call her on the phone
Said he'd been thinking to himself
The way I've treated him like hell
That I've forgotten how to love
And right before he drove away
Through his tears I heard him say
I don't talk to him enough

Who attended Harper Valley Junior High

Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""Mom, I got a note here
From the Harper Valley PTA""

Well, the note says, ""Mrs. Johnson
You're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin'
And a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild""

""And we don't believe you ought to be
A bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary

Well, it happened that the PTA
Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room

And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA""

""Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away""

""And Mr. Baker, can you tell us
Why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told
To keep her window shades all pulled completely down?""

""Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you'll smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin""

""And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I not fit
Well, this is just a little Payton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites""

Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar

Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Que no desaparezca entre mis manos
Que yo pueda sentir, que yo pueda tocar

Nos tiramos, nos merecemos
Nos maltratamos
Sin lavarnos las manos, cariño
A veces no basta con que queramos

Digo tu nombre de nuevo
Y a veces creo, que estoy perdiendo la calma, la calma
Y cada noche despierto cuando siento
Tu voz que siempre me llama, me llama

Paso tras paso
Yo se que te vas acercando a mí
Aunque sea largo el camino te voy a esperar
Siempre aquí

Vuelve, que yo te sigo esperando
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado

Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado
Vuelve, por favor vuelve
Que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Un beso flotando en el aire nos quedara
Mi amor, te pienso
No me dejes de pensar

En cada radio del barrio, suena mi canción
Quiero que llegue a tu casa y tu corazón
Vuelve, que todavía te espero
Vuelve, para quedarte a mi lado

Vuelve, que todo sigue en su sitio
Vuelve, verás que nada ha cambiado
Vuelve, vuelve
(Que todavía te espero)
Vuelve
Por favor vuelve que estoy esperando que vengas a mí

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

I've hung around you just like a fool

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Que sigan la camioneta, que va rumbo a Laredo

One gets dressed and it is perfumed since a good boy does

No salgo ni a la esquina ni hablo con mi vecina,
Aunque no te lo niego sigue estando divina

Esas son puras mentiras
Esa noche yo no andaba all?
Debes estar confundida
O hab?a un tipo igualito a mi (x2)

Me dices que me viste en una p?gina Web,

Con dos Evas al lado y una birra tambi?n,
Que estaba muy contento y como distraido,
Te juro yo esa hora estaba m?s que dormido

No se de que me hablas yo no se que pasa,
Tu siempre por ahi y yo tranquilo en mi casa,
Leyendome unos libros pa' poder comprender,
Como debo tratarte y entenderte mujer

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me

Vengo a decirte que esta cerca tu condena
Hoy una madre murió de pena

Déjame cantar tengo vergüenza
De ser humano como tu y en tu presencia
Descubrirme a mi mismo en tu figura
Que poca cosa somos sin ternura

A ti que aún puedes reír, tan solo vengo a pedirte
Un pequeño favor, que me des un minuto
De tu tiempo mejor para darte lo mío
En mi, mejor canción

Yo traigo la verdad en mi palabra
Vengo a decirte de un niño sin abrigo
Vengo a decirte que hay inviernos que nos muerden
De la falta de un amigo

Vengo a contarte que hay luces que nos hieren
Que existen noches sin whiskys ni placeres
Vengo a decirte que esta cerca tu condena

Descubrirme a mi mismo en tu figura
Que poca cosa somos sin ternura",A Ti

Quiero sentir en el silencio nuestro adiós
Y que ésta pena que me quita la razón
Muera conmigo

Y que ese beso que me das
Sea el recuerdo de una noche junto a tí
Si has de partir para no verte ya jamás
Te llevas mi dolor
Contigo

Sientes como yo esta despedida

Algo que llevo aquí dentro,
Clavado como una espina,
Y así va pasando el tiempo,
Si me animara a decirte,
Lo que a diario voy sintiendo,
Por temor quizás a oírte,
Cosa que oírte no quiero.

Como quisiera decirte,
Que cuando contemplo el cielo,
Tu estrella me va diciendo,
Cuanta falta me hacen tus besos.

Como quisiera decirte,
Que me escuches un momento,
Para quitarme del pecho,
Esto que me va oprimiendo,

Como quisiera decirte,
Que cuando contemplo el cielo,
Tu estrella me va diciendo,
Cuanta falta me hacen tus besos,
Que eres mi amor mi lucero,
Que de sentirme tan lejos,
De apoco me estoy muriendo
Que quiero que estés conmigo,
Como en un final de cuentos.

Y no pretendo figurar en tu programa
Soy como lo fui siempre en tu vida,
Una noche de debut y despedida.

Voy a contar la historia de un cantante
Que entre el público vio a la que fue su amante
Y le cantó sin que nadie supiera
Su propia decepción, su larga espera.

Debo aclarar que no es la vida mía,
Que cualquier coincidencia es pura fantasía
Ya me olvidé de ese cariño falso
Que hoy me viene a pagar con un aplauso.

Quédate sentada donde estás
Que soy el eco nada más de tu conciencia,
Soy como un contrato que se archiva
Una noche de debut y despedida,
Soy como un contrato que se archiva
Una noche de debut y despedida.",Debut y Despedida

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line",Amor Regresa [Cumbia/Andina]

I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Why should I keep loving you 
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue

Me parece que en un bar de Lanús

Paso la noche siguiéndote el rastro
Por la mañana se me duermen las piernas
Me va a matar esta pasión enferma

Con la cola llena de arena
Y perfumada por la sal

Diosa de pelo negro y piel morena
Radiante perla marinera
Como la venus frente al mar

Era como admirar una nereida
Que con sus manos se despeina
Y el viento la vuelve a peinar, suave

Como el susurro de tu boca
Que cuando miras descoloca
Y no se sabe que pensar
Era como admirar una nereida

Que con sus manos se despeina
Y el viento la vuelve a peinar
Dueña de una sonrisa que marea

Cuando tus pechos bambolean
Como tormenta tropical
Un atentado a la moral

Se prendió fuego la serpentina

Saltaba gente por las ventanas
Se escapó una punga
Y un quinielero que se haga cargo

Llegó la yuta a cortar el lío

Y uno sigue 
Sin poder participar 
Sé que a veces 
Cambiaría si pudiera 
Mi vida por otra vida 
Caería del cielo hacia el mar 
Me hundiría en el barro mortal",Diamante
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"La heladera esta vacía 
Las facturas ya vencidas 
En el baño los caños rotos 
La vecina me dice 
Que soy un croto 

No me fía el almacén 
Se enojo doña maria 
Hice un mango el otro día 
Pero lo gaste en bebida
Estoy pelado
Sin un centavo 
Pero no limado 

Que vas a hacer 
No aprendes mas 
La que ganas 
La patinas 
Que vas a hacer 
No aprendes mas 
La que ganas 
Te la gastas 

Con el diario en la mano 
Salí a buscar un trabajo 
No encuentro un carajo 
Mangueé una cerveza 
Me quedo en la esquina 
Tomando sol 

De quinielero, no! 
De boquetero,no! 
De motoquero, no! 
De curandero, no! 
De cana, no! 
De streaper, no!

Travesti, no! 
Fiolo, no!

Que con sabiduría 
Me decia

Hay que aceptar 

El dinero no es todo 
Pero como ayuda 
El dinero no es todo 
Ay! como ayuda 

Con dinero compraria 
Un viaje al congo 
Pa` mi suegra 
El tapizado del torino 
Y los postizos 
De la abuela 

El dinero no es todo 
Pero como ayuda 
El dinero no es todo 
Ay! como ayuda 

Con dinero o sin dinero 
Hago siempre lo que quiero 
Ay! que bueno que seria 
Ganarse la lotería 

Quiero dinero 
Quiero dinero 
Ya sé que no es todo 
Pero igual

Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Esta llegando fin de año
Esta llegando navidad
La familia esta con bronca 
Y en las fiestas va a explotar
Pollo y ensalada rusa
Sidra, cerveza o champagne 
Año nuevo es una excusa
Quieren guerra y la tendrán
Año nuevo, llega navidad! 
De estas fiestas 
Nadie se podrá olvidar
Año nuevo, llega navidad! 
En la mesa 

El pan dulce va a estallar
Sube la temperatura
Tengan ojo al descorchar
Las cañitas voladoras 
Para abajo apuntaran
Se mostraban los colmillos
Ya no se aguantaban más
Y justo antes de las doce 
Se largaba el primer round
Año nuevo, llega navidad! 
A las doce esta fiesta 
Fue una batalla campal
Año nuevo, llega navidad! 
Juntos 
Brindando en el hospital",En Las Fiestas
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Sé que no estaba en tus planes
Nunca te ibas a enamorar 
Y cada vez que te preguntan 
No sabes que contestar
En tu casa no lo entienden 
Y dicen ya se le va a pasar
Un chaparron de verano 
Mucho no puede durar
Nunca te vieron tan enamorada 
Y tu familia esta muy preocupada
Lo pude ver 
En las miradas 
Este payaso va a volar por la ventana

Nunca te vieron tan enamorada 

Tus amigas me analizan 
Como un bicho tropical
Te buscan otros amores 
Para que puedas zafar
Si nos miran nos resienten
Quieren hacerte reaccionar
Piensan que estas embrujada
Perdida en la oscuridad
Nunca te vieron tan enamorada 
Y tu familia esta desesperada
Cuando volvés 
De madrugada 
Te oyen cantar hasta las 10 de la mañana
Nunca te vieron tan enamorada! 
Te llegó el amor y te hizo abrir el corazón 
Como una flor en la mañana
Nunca te vieron tan enamorada! 
Los lunes son viernes y la lluvia son un regalo 
Cuando estas enamorada",Enamorada
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Si se apaga un día el sol 
Siempre habrá música 
Si no existiera el amor 
Habría música 
Y en la gloria del final 
Solo habrá música 
Quien no crea en Dios ni el Diablo 
Tiene aquí un altar 
No hace nunca mal, 
Esta en el aire sin pagar 
Y me parece lo mas lindo de la vida; 
Luz espiritual nadie la puede negar. 
Hay una cosa tan maravillosa 
Que se hace difícil de hablar 
Acércate a oír que te va a gustar 

Ah! Que linda la música 

Hay una cosa tan maravillosa 
Que se hace difícil de hablar 
Acércate a oír que te va a gustar 

Y en la gloria del final 
Cuando ya no quede nada 
Habrá música 
Siempre habrá música",La Musica
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Yo pensaba 
Que podía 
Dominar la situación 
Y ahora vengo a darme cuenta de mi error 
Suponía que tenia controlada la emoción 
Pero soy como una nena en camisón 
Pretendía ser mi guía 
Siempre termino en el mismo callejón 
Y es que a cada nuevo intento 
Ya ni yo me creo el cuento 
De que vaya algo a cambiar 
Ya así me entrego al baile sin pensar 
Tanta alegría seguida me va a hacer mal 
Vengo con un ritmo que no puedo pilotear 
Tanta alegría seguida me va a enfermar 
Por este camino voy seguro al hospital 
Tanta a alegría seguida me va a matar 
Mejor seria que abandone el carnaval 
Pero aunque prometa y prometa 
Ponerme a hacer dieta 
Me falta voluntad, el hambre me termina por ganar 

Y así, pasa el tiempo, gira el mundo 
Y sigo siempre igual 
Soy una victima de mi debilidad 
Pasa el tiempo, gira el mundo 
Y sigo siempre igual 
Soy una victima de mi debilidad 
Calma, calma",No Puedo
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Yo sé que estaría mejor si me tranquilizara 
E hiciera las cosa de a una 
Y no todo a la vez 
Seria mejor si las uñas no me las comiera 
Y al menos cuando estoy durmiendo parara de hablar 
Y es tan difícil la concentración 
Quiero estar al mismo tiempo en todos lados 
Y al momento de sentarme 
Ya me tengo que parar 
Vengo de acá, voy para allá 
No tengo paz 

(No tengo paz) 
No tengo paz (no tengo paz) 
Cambio de tema sin razón 
En una conversación y voy dejando los problemas 
Sin solución 
No puedo quedarme quieto 
Caminando en el fuego 
Uno se tiene que mover 
Tengo mas nervios que una ardilla en Tamilan 
Perdí la calma y ya no la puedo encontrar",No Tengo Paz
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Vos tenés un auto nuevo 
Pero vas en colectivo 
Te bajas si esta vacío 
Y subís en hora pico 
Una vez tuviste novia 
Y te aguanto mas de la cuenta 
La dejaste un día plantada 
Por un viaje en el 60 
Apoyándote, frotándote 
Buscás amor 
Inocente

Este vicio adolescente te atrapo 
El rozador, el rozador 
Pantalones de bambula 
Que compras en las ofertas 
Incrementan el contacto 
Con la victima indefensa
Respirándole en la nuca 
Con cara de distraído 
Te aguantas el cachetazo 
Nunca te das por vencido 
Nunca te das por vencido
Apoyándote, frotándote 

Buscas amor 
Por castigo 
En retiro te tiraron de un vagón 
El rozador, el rozador",El Razador
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Soñaba que a mi lado 
Brillabas de alegría
Pintada de colores 
Tu sonrisa me encanto 
Y al verme ya despierto 
Siento al sol que me acaricia
Las sabanas marcadas 
Con la huella de tu adiós 
Y una carta final de despedida 
La cruel sentencia a muerte 
Y la fragancia de una flor 
Cuando marchita 
No entiendo porque 
Lo nuestro termino
No es fácil de olvidar 
Lo que más nos lastima
Tu caja de Pandora 
Es como el himen 

Blindado a mi amor 
Caminando sedientos 
Golpe a golpe 
Fuimos derrumbando las fronteras 
Y hoy sobre sus escombros 
Nos amamos por ultima vez
Y una lagrima cayo 
por tu mejilla se convertía en hielo 
lo que ayer nos abrigo y 
la fragancia de una flor cuando marchita
Cautiva en el desierto 
naufragando entre arenas 
mi alma errante se enredo 
Acribillada a espaldas 
por tus balas que están hechas 
de pólvora y pasión 
Y es que no volveré otra vez 
A ser el blanco de tu arpón 
Y olvídate mi vida",Sonaba
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"No me pidas una excusa 
No me llores que me muero 
Son cuestiones que no puedo responder
No me siento abandonado 
Sé que estas siempre a mi lado 
Es mentira que estoy con otra mujer
Te contaron que me vieron 
La otra noche con amigos 
En la barra casi en forma de fernet
No es lo que te imaginabas 
Que con otra te engañaba 
Le contaba que de ti me enamore
No es engaño, no es pasión 
No me importa el que dirán 
Vos sabes como soy yo 
Digo siempre la verdad
En la vida necesito que me quieras 
Y el invierno me lo vuelvas primavera",Te Contaron
Los Auténticos Decadentes,"Noche tras noche 
Salgo a buscarte 
Una vez mas te encontrare 
Nunca es muy tarde 
En casa no me esperan 
No hay nada en la heladera 
En tu jardín 
Quiero vivir 
La vida entera
Estas bailando 
Bailando sola 
Y me miras 
Moviéndote 
Provocadora 

Una aventura sin reproche 
Es el perfume de la noche 
Es un licor hecho de estrellas 
Estribillo I 
(en el amor 
Es el mejor 
Dejarse ir 
Sin pensar en nada) 
Entrelazados

Cuando sigo derecho

De la culpa y el error 
Y dejo de seguir la luz del sol 
En el fondo del dolor 
La fuerza de la vida 
Me seduce a levantarme una vez mas 
Frente al vacío me siento inmortal 
Soy el martillo y el cristal 
Yo puedo, si quiero 
Tomar un rumbo nuevo 
Puedo vencer la gravedad 
Yo puedo, si quiero 
Adentro llevo un fuego 

Y soy mi faro en alta mar 
Cuando me atan las cadenas 
Del apego material 
Y quiero dar un paso al mas allá 
Subo a un plano espiritual 
Se ven las cosas de otro modo 
Cuando se deja de pensar 
Sacude el alma un silencio abismal 
Y sopla el viento sideral 
Yo puedo, si quiero 
Abandonar mi cuerpo 
Resucitar a voluntad 
Yo puedo, su quiero 
Navegar en el tiempo 
Y ahora voy a levitar",Yo Puedo

Corriendo a su ventana
Por primera vez
Cante una serenata
Ella me invitó a subir 
Y yo acepte con ganas
Con el corazón 
Le dije que la amaba
Buscate un abogado 
Y empezá a rezar 

Que vas a ir preso 
Porque es menor de edad
Cuando la abracé 
Bailaba en una pata 
Y en la habitación 
Sonaron las campanas
Hasta que sentí 
El ruido de unas botas
Si no se me da 
Me corto la gaviota

Y empezá a rezar 
Que vas a ir preso 
Porque es menor de edad

Y se me vino encima 
Y se le noto

Se zarandeaba provocativa
Para mirarla de atrás
Se daba vuelta a toda la esquina

Yo la quería encarar
Ay, pero solo no me animaba

Vení Raquel, vení con los muchachos
Vení Raquel, te vas a divertir
Vení Raquel, vení no tengas miedo
